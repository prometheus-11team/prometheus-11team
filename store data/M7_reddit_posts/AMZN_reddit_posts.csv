2025-04-28 22:32:06,Amazon,AMZN,"Stock market today: Dow, S&P 500 erase slide to rise for 5th straight day in lead up to Big Tech earnings","Stocks closed mixed on Monday but recovered from sharp losses to begin a big week of heavyweight earnings reports and macroeconomic data that will continue to paint an early picture of the US economy's response to President Trump's tariffs.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) erased losses of as much as 1% to rise just above the flatline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) edged up 0.3%, notching its longest win streak of 2025. Both indexes ended in positive territory for the fifth straight day.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell below the flatline, as shares of Big Tech recovered from steep early-session losses.

Wall Street is coming off a rebounding run last week. The gains came as Trump eased pressure on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, and hinted at light at the end of the tunnel for sky-high 145% tariffs on China. On Monday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said it was ""up to China"" to deescalate the trade battle, though he suggested its recent moves to exempt certain US goods from duties represented a positive step.

Earnings are the highlight of the week ahead, with 180 S&P 500 companies expected to report quarterly financial results. Big Tech leads the way, as Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) are all due in the coming days, alongside Coca-Cola (KO), Eli Lilly (LLY), and Chevron (CVX).

Broader economic news will flavor the coming days, as investors eye Wednesday's release of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumer Expenditures (PCE) index, to see the impact of tariffs on the general public's ""core"" expenses. An initial reading on first quarter US GDP is also due Wednesday.

The April jobs report is also in sight, as the labor market has so far remained resistant to signs of economic slowdown.

The April jobs report is also in sight, as the labor market has remained resistant to signs of economic slowdown. Economists expect the US economy added 133,000 nonfarm payroll jobs last month, with the unemployment rate remaining at 4.2%.

The most critical reading may be the non-farm payrolls report on Friday, as the market expects an addition of about 125K jobs.

The goldilocks read may be around 100-150K jobs. We don't want a number that is too strong, as it would likely decrease the probabilities for future rate cuts. At the same time, we don't want a number that is perceived as too weak, as it would imply that the economy may be worsening more rapidly than anticipated, raising recession and other concerns.

It dipped, but it's been holding up better than a lot of my other holdings, and I like having steady dividend income to reinvest elsewhere.



That said, I know I've been neglecting tech. I’ve got a small position in AMZN and an even smaller one in AAPL.



My original plan for May was to bulk up on LMT (not a tech company, but adjacent in some ways) because I think that will go back up again at some point.



I also noticed RDDT is still down — not as much as it was during the big dip last week, but enough to catch my eye. I've seen it move pretty fast when momentum is on its side.

If it's the latter of the three, feel free to correct me.

For the past weeks I have seen so many people saying they are holding cash because they point out it's plainly and clearly obvious that in the coming months tariffs will finally take effect and that's when the true hurt will begin. The stock market is still overpriced. The V shape recovery after a crash is a lie this time! A true recession is where stocks will be down for years. Europe hasn't even retaliated yet. The true people who are 20+ aged investors and lived through 2008 know it's time to hold cash and wait. Even Warren Buffet is holding cash!

All pure speculation in my view. If I asked you right now what Trump's next move is, what Xi Jinping's next move it, if there will be a trade deal between USA and China, if Trump is backing down now due to advisors, can you answer any of these with certainty? Can you also tell me that when GOOG, NVDA, UBER, META, AMZN, XOM, etc all report earnings they will tank rather than go up and bring the markets up? Where exactly is the market bottom?

Just stop. Just like how today I can't tell you we are going back to a bull market with reaching ATH by the end of the year because we just had two massive days of rallies and Trump saying he is going to be soft on China with reports that his advisors were shitting the bed about the economy, you equally can't call the opposite about bull traps or whatever. What I can tell you is that you just missed a bunch of blue-chip stocks that were trading for one of their most undervalued prices ever. You should have been buying a week ago, you should be buying now, you should be DCAing stocks you have conviction in until they reach a price you believe is overvalued and you find a better opportunity in another. 

If you are an investor and stock holder, you are in this for the long-run. You are in this 10+ years. Even if your recession thesis plays out the market will recover.

[Gold](https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/investing/article/gold-price-today-wednesday-april-16-2025-gold-opens-with-new-high-134956304.html) has surpassed the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks as the most crowded trade on Wall Street as the precious metal surged to record highs this year amid volatile markets and an uncertain economic backdrop.

According to the latest Bank of America fund managers survey published this week, nearly half of the fund managers surveyed (49%) see long gold, or bets that gold prices will rise, as the most crowded trade in the market right now. This marks the first time in two years that fund managers did not see the Magnificent Seven as Wall Street's most crowded trade, according to the survey.

Gold futures ([GC=F](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GC=F/)) on Wednesday rose to an all-time high of $3,334 as investors continued to [favor the safe-haven asset](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-notches-best-week-since-2020-amid-shaken-investor-confidence-in-us-201546983.html) amid a falling US dollar ([DX-Y.NYB](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/DX-Y.NYB/__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!HIhgXKgPRojUSTTqYlaKSTMqCnabU-_BFJYcQNg1l9bJcllZ1Gp3LtN-1O0pcbknpYvKz0DBczt7-zHHf99GDzXJ1VfxDc7wuw$)) and tariff uncertainty.

Gold prices have surged more than 27% year to date, while the Magnificent Seven tech stocks — Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)), Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL), [GOOG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG)), Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)), Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)), Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)), Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)), and Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) — are down considerably.

Tesla stock has led Magnificent Seven losses and is down about 38% since the start of 2025. Apple stock has fallen 21%.

Nvidia stock has also declined 21% year to date. On Wednesday,[ the AI chip giant warned of a multibillion-dollar ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-dives-as-chipmaker-sees-55-billion-hit-from-surprise-china-chip-controls-130319576.html)impact from US export controls on China, which weighed on shares.

Shares of Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon — the remainder of the Magnificent Seven — are all down by double-digit percentages since the start of the year.

Gold's rally comes as [central banks' demand hit all-time highs](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-demand-hits-record-levels-as-central-banks-buy-at-eye-watering-pace-205945413.html) last year and as investors increased inflows into physical gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

""The new highs in gold are signaling a shift in appetite for US assets,"" Ryan McIntyre, senior managing partner at asset manager firm Sprott, recently told Yahoo Finance.

""Confidence in the US has clearly been shaken, so people are looking to diversify.""

Some 42% of fund managers expect gold will be the best-performing asset of 2025, up from 23% in March, according to Bank of America.

The firm's survey also showed investors have rotated out of US assets by a record amount over the past two months, with 73% of respondents saying ""US exceptionalism"" has peaked.",452,54,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1k0nih7/after_surge_to_record_highs_gold_overtakes/

# Key Takeaways

* Netflix shares jumped Tuesday after a report company executives laid out ambitious targets at a business review meeting last month.
* The streaming giant aims to double its revenue by 2030 and reach a market capitalization of $1 trillion, *The* *Wall Street Journal* reported Monday.
* Netflix is set to report first-quarter results after the market closes Thursday.

Netflix (NLFX) shares jumped Tuesday following a report company executives laid out ambitious targets at a business review meeting last month.

Executives said the streaming giant aims to double the $39 billion in revenue Netflix brought in last year, with a global ad sales target of $9 billion by 2030, *The* *Wall Street Journal* reported Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The streaming giant also aims to reach a [market capitalization](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp) of $1 trillion by 2030, the report said, up from roughly $419.2 billion. The only U.S. companies with a market cap above $1 trillion today include Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B).

Netflix did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Shares were up more than 5% in recent trading Tuesday, leading gains on the S&P 500. They've added about 60% of their value over the past 12 months. (Read *Investopedia's* live coverage of [today's market action here](https://www.investopedia.com/dow-jones-today-04152025-11715325).)

The streaming giant has shown ""momentum” in its core subscription business, the analysts said. That momentum lowers the company’s overall risk, the bank added, even if the advertising market struggles amid rising trade tensions.

2025-04-09 20:49:35,Amazon,AMZN,I warned everyone tariffs were a negotiating tactic 5 days ago. Nobody listened,"[This was my post verbatim](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/s/S6dzbSZx1I), it was downvoted and criticized to oblivion. Never trust the Reddit mob.


“Tariffs will be negotiated away. Buy as much stocks as possible!

Everyone here is panicking and thinking these tariffs are going to destroy everything. It’s not an incorrect thought… IF they stay in effect for a long period. 

However it’s important to listen to what Trump has said. Trump said he’s open to tarrif cuts if countries offer something phenomenal. He also said now these countries will be coming to us to negotiate rather than the other way around. He used tik tok as an example to say he may cut tarrif on china to close a tik tok deal. 

Trump put these tariffs in effect to give him huge leverage over every country. He even bragged that every country has called him to negotiate. Acting tough like the tariffs will be in place for a few years, is ONLY to increase their leverage. The more difficult it seems to remove tariffs the more negotiating power Trump has. 

This is a rare stock crash where it’s completely self inflicted with the signing of a pen from the president. This means to end this pain will ONLY take the president to end the tariffs- which can be done instantly. 

I am very sure this will be exactly like the Covid crash. He will keep talking a big talk and more and more terrible news will come out. But then there will be cracks as exceptions are made and deals are negotiated. This is literally the man who wrote “Art of the Deal”. He is 100% transactional and is always aiming to make a deal.

Personally I am buying AI stocks like crazy. This is probably the last chance to get on the AI boat before this stuff rockets. SMH, ASML, NVDA, AMZN META—- all these big tech names will come out fine long term. No matter how scary it gets just keep buying. “",0,56,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jvgeuy/i_warned_everyone_tariffs_were_a_negotiating/

2025-04-09 15:10:00,Amazon,AMZN,Amazon cancels some inventory orders from China after tariffs,"[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-cancels-inventory-orders-china-142849013.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-cancels-inventory-orders-china-142849013.html)

(Bloomberg) — [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) Inc. ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)) has canceled orders for multiple products made in China and other Asian countries, according to a document reviewed by Bloomberg and people familiar with the matter, suggesting the company is reducing its exposure to tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump.

The orders for beach chairs, scooters, air conditioners and other merchandise from multiple Amazon vendors were halted after Trump’s April 2 announcement that he planned to levy tariffs on more than 180 countries and territories, including China, Vietnam and Thailand, the people said. The timing of the cancellations, which had no warning, led the vendors to suspect it was a response to tariffs.

An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment. The company identified international trade disputes as a risk factor in its annual report released in February. “China-based suppliers provide significant portions of our components and finished goods,” the company said.

It’s unclear how widespread the cancellations are and how many types of merchandise they affect.

One vendor who has been selling beach chairs made in China to Amazon for more than a decade received an email from the company last week that said it was canceling some purchase orders it placed “in error“ and instructed the vendor not to ship them. The email, which was reviewed by Bloomberg, didn’t mention tariffs.

The vendor said the $500,000 wholesale order was nixed after the chairs had already been manufactured, leaving this person on the hook to pay the factory and find other buyers. The vendor, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation from Amazon, said the company had never canceled one of its orders in such as manner.

Scott Miller, a former Amazon vendor manager who now works as an e-commerce consultant, said Amazon canceled orders for merchandise made in China and other Asian countries from several of his clients. The cancellations came without warning, he said, and could force vendors to renegotiate terms with the e-commerce company.

“Amazon really holds all of the cards,” said Miller, founder and CEO of pdPlus in Minneapolis. “The only real recourse vendors have is to either sell this inventory in other countries at lower margins or try to work with other retailers.”

The beach chair vendor and Miller said Amazon cancelled “direct import orders,” a process in which Amazon buys inventory wholesale in the country in which it is made and ships the products to its warehouses in the United States. Amazon serves as the importer of record for the orders, which means it pays tariffs when the products reach US ports.

Amazon has been importing items this way for years as a way to reduce costs since Amazon can often use bulk shipping rates to import items at lower costs than vendors. Canceling those orders puts the tariff exposure back on vendors if they import merchandise to the US by other means.

Items Amazon buys directly from vendors account for about 40% of the products sold on its website. The rest of the company’s sales are made by independent merchants who essentially rent digital shelf space from Amazon, paying the company commissions and fees for logistics and advertising.

Trump’s tariffs have rattled global markets. Many businesses are raising prices, stoking fears of a recession. On Tuesday, Robert W. Baird & Co. Inc. reduced its 2025 revenue forecast for Amazon, citing the effects of tariffs in a research note. The company’s shares have fallen about 21% this year, compared with the S&P 500’s 15% slump.",28,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jv849a/amazon_cancels_some_inventory_orders_from_china/

2025-04-04 11:03:55,Amazon,AMZN,Tariffs will be negotiated away. Buy as much stocks as possible!,"Everyone here is panicking and thinking these tariffs are going to destroy everything. It’s not an incorrect thought… IF they stay in effect for a long period. 

However it’s important to listen to what Trump has said. Trump said he’s open to tarrif cuts if countries offer something phenomenal. He also said now these countries will be coming to us to negotiate rather than the other way around. He used tik tok as an example to say he may cut tarrif on china to close a tik tok deal. 

Trump put these tariffs in effect to give him huge leverage over every country. He even bragged that every country has called him to negotiate. Acting tough like the tariffs will be in place for a few years, is ONLY to increase their leverage. The more difficult it seems to remove tariffs the more negotiating power Trump has. 

This is a rare stock crash where it’s completely self inflicted with the signing of a pen from the president. This means to end this pain will ONLY take the president to end the tariffs- which can be done instantly. 

I am very sure this will be exactly like the Covid crash. He will keep talking a big talk and more and more terrible news will come out. But then there will be cracks as exceptions are made and deals are negotiated. This is literally the man who wrote “Art of the Deal”. He is 100% transactional and is always aiming to make a deal.

Personally I am buying AI stocks like crazy. This is probably the last chance to get on the AI boat before this stuff rockets.

2025-04-03 18:13:52,Amazon,AMZN,"Apple sheds $300 billion in tariff-fueled sell-off, on track for worst drop since March 2020","[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-sheds-300-billion-in-tariff-fueled-sell-off-on-track-for-worst-drop-since-march-2020-175727479.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-sheds-300-billion-in-tariff-fueled-sell-off-on-track-for-worst-drop-since-march-2020-175727479.html)

Tech stocks plummeted on Thursday, with Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)) leading ""Magnificent Seven"" names lower following President Trump's[ reciprocal tariff announcement](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-every-country-facing-reciprocal-tariffs-announced-by-trump-on-liberation-day-231329935.html) the day prior.

Shares of Apple, on track for their worst day since March 2020, cratered over 8% in afternoon trade as the stock erased $300 billion from its market cap. The largest risk, according to analysts, centers on the iPhone maker's overseas production hubs, which are particularly vulnerable to the tariffed countries.

On Wednesday, Trump announced tariffs that will impact some 185 countries, including the United States's largest trading partners. Additional reciprocal tariffs, for instance, will include 34% tariffs on Chinese imports, a 20% tariff on European Union imports, a 46% tariff on imports from Vietnam, 32% on imports from Taiwan, and 26% on India — all set to take effect on April 9.

Notably, the additional 34% tax on China will be added to the country's existing 20% tariff, meaning its total tariff rate will rise to 54%. China is Apple's most important [production hub](https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook-apple-supply-chain-trump-tariffs-china-diversify-iphone-2025-1?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=yahoo.com), with about 85% of its iPhones manufactured there.

""Apple produces basically all their iPhones in China, and the question will be around exceptions and exemptions on this tariff policy if those companies are building more operations, factories, and plants in the US[ like Apple announced in February](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-will-spend-more-than-500-billion-usd-in-the-us-over-the-next-four-years/),"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients following the announcement.

As trade tensions escalate, Apple has moved to increase its supply chain beyond just China, boosting manufacturing in places like India and Vietnam. But with the new tariff announcements set to impact those countries too, there's now limited room for reprieve.

""The worry will be around pricing and margin impacts along with what this means for the global supply chain looking forward,"" Ives said. For now, the analyst continues to believe major negotiations will happen over the coming months as companies attempt to navigate ""this new world of tariffs.""

Until then, he warned, ""tech stocks will clearly be under major pressure.""

Other Magnificent Seven players also faced significant selling action. In aggregate, that cohort of stocks is currently on track to eliminate over $800 billion from their collective market caps.

In afternoon trade, Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)) and Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) each fell 7%, followed by a 6% drop in both Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL)) and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)). Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)) dipped 3%, while Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)) was off just under 2%.

Outside of the Mag Seven, chip stocks faced similar declines, despite the exemption of semiconductors from Trump's additional tariffs. Nvidia competitor Broadcom ([AVGO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AVGO)), for example, erased well over $50 billion from its market cap following an 8% drop in shares.

""The implications \[of the announced tariffs\] are broad-reaching, and we see negative implications for the whole \[chip\] sector,"" KeyBanc analyst John Vinh wrote in a note to clients. ""These are most notably going to negatively impact end-demand in key markets including smartphones/iPhones and PCs, as a significant amount of manufacturing is done within China.""

Stacy Rasgon, Bernstein's managing director and senior analyst, added in an interview with Yahoo Finance that the biggest headwind for semiconductors is not necessarily the direct impact of tariffs. Rather, it's the risk of demand destruction as these products become more expensive.

He added, ""The other risk for semis is that they are very cyclical, very global, and very correlated to the macro and to GDP. [So if this tips us into recession, ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-economy-dangerously-vulnerable-to-recession-wall-street-reacts-to-tariff-fallout-155837444.html)that's probably not going to be great.""",216,63,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jqpre5/apple_sheds_300_billion_in_tarifffueled_selloff/

2025-03-28 03:07:37,Amazon,AMZN,"CoreWeave, the biggest IPO of 2025. (DD on $CRWV)","# I love IPOs.

The last IPO I thought was amazing was ARM (and how far we've come!).  Coreweave (IPOing on the 28th!) is another one I think has a ton of potential. (I wrote the majority of this before the reduced IPO sizing so please forgive me if my math is incorrect).

CoreWeave is a cloud infrastructure provider specializing in GPU computing, called an “AI hyperscaler.” They run data centers full of GPUs and rent out that computing power to customers via the cloud. Similar to AWS/Azure, but they're focused on AI/ML/GPU tasks like making stupid Studio Ghibli pictures of yourself.

CRWV started in 2017 mining ETH but pivoted to being a GPU farm in 2019 after the crash. By 2022, they fully exited crypto mining and doubled down on enterprise GPU cloud services​. This early mover advantage in GPU hosting, (along with all the GPUs they bought from NVDA), have made it a player in the the cloud services space.

CRWV makes money by charging for usage-based cloud compute - clients pay for GPU hours on their servers.​ Initially, they served niches like VFX studios (movies like Interstellar take millions of GPU hours to render), but now AI training and inference workloads are the main growth driver​.

Companies like META/IBM/MSFT have used CRWV for AI compute needs in the past​. CRWV's differentiator is through software- they claim custom scheduling software (e.g. a system called “SUNK” and an optimizer “Tensorizer”) that yields better hardware utilization, faster container spin-ups, and higher throughput than general-purpose which makes them more efficient to use.

In practice, that means a customer training a large ML model might get results faster or cheaper on CRWV than on AWS. CRWV currently operates 32 data centers with 250k+ NVDA GPUs and are very aggressive in acquiring them- they deploy A100, H100, and H200s and are prioritized as customers of NVDA.

**The NVDA Relationship**

NVDA backs CRWV, and they're strong partners (which means they prioritize each other over other customers). Due to this, I dismiss the possibility that CRWV will ever have troubles on the supply side of obtaining GPUs. Something that is fairly common knowledge is that NVDA (and other companies) prefer selling GPUs in bulk because it simplifies customer service and they can charge for enterprise support and  sell thousands at a time. It's also why NVDA spits on the face of their gaming customers.

**Isn't it kind of shady that NVDA both invests and is a customer of CRWV? Why doesn't NVDA use their own chips instead of renting capacity from CRWV?**

Kind of. Nothing they've done is outright illegal (even using their GPUs as collateral is within the law). Even companies that build GPUs need to rent compute when there's a massive amount of demand. MSFT did it, NVDA did it, OpenAI WILL do it. CRWV signed a direct deal with OpenAI: a multi-year commitment up to $11.9 B for GPU cloud capacity​. They have ties to the major AI players. This entire DD going forward assumes that they will continue to keep their relationship with NVDA because NVDA needs them so AWS doesn't swallow the entire market. 

**The Financials**

CRWV has had ridiculous growth- In 2022, they had revenue of $15.8 M (the majority of which came from ETH mining). In 2023, their GPU computing pivot led to revenue of $229M, then $1.9B in 2024. This was obviously fueled by the release of ChatGPT as demand for GPU compute exploded as other companies scrambled to compete with their OWN LLM models.

By 2024, CRWV neared $2 B in annual sales, transforming from a niche player to a major cloud provider in two years.

The financial issue is that CRWV is unprofitable as it scales. In 2023, it lost \~$600M, and in 2024m \~$860M. For every $1 of revenue in 2024, they spent about $1.45 for huge investments in data centers, GPUs, and the associated operating costs (plus interest on debt they've taken out which they have a ton of).

The S-1 shows operating costs close to \~$1B from tech/infra in 2024, which includes data center space, buying/depreciating their GPUs, electricity costs, maintenance staff, etc. The capex is massive and is funded largely by debt.

The cash burn is brutal as well- at the end of 2024 CRWV still has negative FCF (which is normal for a pre-ipo high growth tech startup) and is betting that they will eventually claw their way to profitability despite the brutal looking financials (like Uber, Snowflake, Robinhood, insert your choice of tech startup here lol). The bet is that high upfront investment now will secure long-term contracts and scale to profitability later, like most tech IPOs.

**Customer Concentration**

In 2023, Microsoft accounted for \~35% of CRWV’s revenue​. In 2024, that grew to \~62% of total revenue​. Their S-1 mentioned that close to \~80% of their revenue comes from two customers alone. But this is a warning sign because MSFT wants to build their own (hence their announcement of spending \~$80B in 2025 for AI data centers).

**If MSFT scales back their use of CRWV then they are frankly fucked.** MSFT's CEO also mentioned that using external capacity (like CRWV) for GPUs was a short-term stopgap until their own investment in Azure pays off.

However, the OpenAI deal (remember that OpenAI is 49% owned by MSFT) could take the place of MSFT going forward. The contract is up to $11.9B through 2030​, which averages out to \~$2B/year if used, which is equivalent to all of CRWV's 2024 revenue.  If OpenAI maximizes their usage, CRWV’s revenue could potentially double at minimum if MSFT doesn't pull out. This is a wild hopium optimistic case but I thought it was worth mentioning.

Beyond those two, CRWV has other customers that make up the \~20% of 2024 revenue). These include research labs, VFX studios, and other tech companies but none are individually as large compared to the MSFT/OpenAI. What will make or break this company in the long run is the diversification of the client base because all their eggs are in one basket.

**IPO Technicals**

CRWV sold 37.5M shares at $40/share, getting $1.5B and giving it a $20B valuation. That was below CRWV's official target of offering 49M shares at $47-$55, raising up to $2.7B at $32B valuation​. This signals a lack of interest in the initial offering and is not great news if you already hold the stock, but is excellent if you're a short term trader that wants to see a pop on IPO day- the stock has more room to run. Yes, this means it's good for retail, bad for insiders.

**Valuation/Comparables**

Is a \~$20B valuation reasonable for CRWV? You can do a rough comparison:

|**Company**|Annual Revenue (2024)|**Recent Valuation**|**EV/Revenue Multiple**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**CoreWeave** (CRWV)|$1.92 B|\~$20B (target IPO)|\~10×|
|**Snowflake** (SNOW)|$3.41 B​|\~$52 B (market cap)|\~15× ​|
|**Databricks**\*|\~$3 B by end of 2025|\~$62 B ​|\~20×|
|**AWS** (AMZN)|$107.6 B​|\~$500 B|\~4-5×|

(That's not a typo- AWS is valued at \~$500B, it's the main driver of AMZN's growth, yet struggles to grow because it's already massive). \*Also note that Databricks is a private company

I think that if the company can maintain a hyper-growth trajectory (e.g. 2-3× growth for a couple more years), then an 10× multiple now could look cheap in hindsight. For instance, 2025 revenue could hit \~$4 B+ with the OpenAI ramp and other clients. Of course, we have risks like growth decelerating, and tariffs and Trump and China that could come in and decimate growth. And of course, they're not profitable (for now). Ironically, CRWV and other US firms would BENEFIT from chip restrictions because they'd be prioritized over the overseas ones that use NVDA chips.

CRWV’s valuation is aggressive (dare I say fair for a hyperscaler), but in line  with other cloud providers. The entire short term bull thesis depends on them retaining MSFT as a customer and also keeping OpenAI- if that occurs then investing in it now looks like a no-brainer. If not, **it's completely possible we see an 50%+ selloff. I think that's the reason why we're seeing such hesitancy in this valuation.**

This valuation is also dependent on entirely dependent on AI spending GROWING, society seeing greater integration in AI (more than we have now), and AI firms willing to continue spending on compute they can't harness themselves. We are still supply constrained on GPUs in general, and if we ever experience NVDA building more GPUs than there is demand for, then Coreweave's margins are threatened and profitability can vanish. For now, it looks like that is unlikely to happen.

**IPO Trading Details**

37.5M shares is decent IPO volume so I don't expect this to be illiquid when it trades. The main things I watch for are indication price (whether there are people who want to buy the print of the stock higher than what we IPO at) and share paired (which somewhat signal when the IPO will open for trading).

Overall, this is a pure AI play on GPU compute, a bet that demand for GPUs will continue to outstrip supply,  and that MSFT/OpenAI/every other tech firm involved won't slit their throat in in the eternal game of thrones that is capitalism.

**TL;DR:** There's a hell of a lot of risk, but I like the stock. It's completely possible it could open and sell off because the insiders just want to bail. It's possible that it skyrockets. Anything is possible in the wild and crazy world of IPO trading.

2025-03-25 22:14:10,Amazon,AMZN,Stocks Close Higher for 3rd Straight Day; Tesla Surges in Late Trading to Extend Rally,"
Major indexes closed slightly higher Tuesday as the stock market continued its recovery from an extended selloff.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite added 0.2% and 0.5%, respectively, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose fractionally. Stocks had kicked off the week with big gains following news that President Trump could scale back some of the tariffs that are due to be imposed next week on U.S. trading partners. With the recent gains, the Dow has inched back into positive territory for 2025, as stocks have rebounded from a month-long selloff spurred by concerns about the potential impact of tariffs and uncertainty about the outlook for the economy.

Investors brushed off consumer confidence data released this morning that came in weaker than expected, with the index hitting its lowest level in more than four years. Investors are closing watching all data points amid worries that tariffs could reignite inflation and cause economic growth to stall. The big economic report of the week comes Friday with the scheduled release of the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which had fallen during the recent stock market rout amid the growing concerns about the economy, was at 4.32% in late trading, down from 4.33% at yesterday's close and from an earlier high Tuesday of 4.37%. The yield, which affects costs on all sorts of loans, notably mortgages, hit its highest level in more than a month this morning.

Mega-cap technology stocks, which helped lead Monday's rally, were mostly higher again today. Shares of Tesla (TSLA) rallied late in the day to finish 3.5% higher, gaining ground for the 5th consecutive session, despite news Tuesday that the EV maker's sales in Europe continued to slide. Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta Platforms (META) each rose more than 1%, while Microsoft (MSFT) inched ahead. Chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) closed slightly lower

AWS is a behemoth at $ 108 Bn in 2024 sales, and still growing at 19%. That is still remarkable growth for a market leader with two other 800-pound Gorillas, Alphabet and Microsoft, chasing it. It generated operating profits of $39 Bn last year, a growth of 66% with an operating profit margin of 37%.

Amazon's advertising revenue last year was estimated at $56Bn and growing around 20% a year. This is also a high operating margin business, generating over 20% in operating profits.

While online domestic and international sales are a drag, growing slower in single digits, they're not significantly slower than Walmart’s sales growth and margins.

Amazon Prime has about 200Mn members and is another sustainable, sticky, and high-margin business, valued at close to $360Bn.

I used a 10x multiple for the high-growth, high-profit margin, and sustainable businesses.

|Advertising 10x sales|600|56|
|Prime 10x sales|360|36|

2025-03-21 00:54:15,Amazon,AMZN,Short sellers have made $15 billion betting against Tesla and Nvidia in 2025,"Short sellers have been cleaning up to start 2025 amid a massive sell-off in some of the market's most popular names over the past two years.

Short sellers have made a combined $15 billion betting against Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) stock thus far this year, according to data from S3 Partners. Tesla shorts alone have raked in nearly $11 billion, while bets against Nvidia have brought in more than $4 billion.

Tesla's 40% year-to-date drop has led the declines of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks. Investors have grown concerned about CEO Elon Musk's focus on government efficiency efforts and how his role with President Trump's administration could be a turnoff to the electric vehicle maker's customer base.

But it hasn't just been Tesla lagging. As an index, the Magnificent Seven — which also includes Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) — is underperforming the S&P 500 this quarter by the most since 2022.

Short sellers have profited off of all of the names in the cohort this year. They've brought in nearly $5 billion betting against Apple stock, which is down nearly 14% in 2025.

The crash in the most popular trade of the past two years comes as investors have been re-rating their growth expectations. Fears of slowing economic growth and the impact of Trump's tariff policies have weighed on markets. Meanwhile, Big Tech has faced growing investor criticism about its ballooning AI spend and whether or not it will eventually boost future profits as much as Wall Street hopes. The year also included a massive drawdown in some large tech names, including Nvidia, following the release of a cheaper AI model from Chinese company DeepSeek.

Now, with most of the names sitting around 20% off their recent 52-week highs, the looming question for markets is whether or not investor appetite for the stocks that led the market higher for the past two years will return.

""Maybe these tech stocks got ahead of their skis a little bit,"" BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski told Yahoo Finance last week.

2025-03-20 06:08:52,Amazon,AMZN,A Deeper Dive on Trump's Tariffs and Market Positioning,"Trump’s latest trade policies are hammering the markets—S&P 500 down \~9%, Nasdaq off \~12%—and it looks like he’s doubling down. Tariffs on China, Canada, Mexico, and the EU are back on the table, with zero indication that he’s backing down. While some sectors (steel, domestic manufacturing) stand to benefit, others (tech, autos, multinational retailers) are getting crushed. The question is: at what point does the market pain force Trump to change course?

The **2025 Trade Policy Agenda** lays out his vision:

✅ **Tariffs as leverage** – forcing trade partners into more “reciprocal” deals

✅ **USMCA review (2026)** – questioning whether Canada & Mexico are benefiting unfairly

✅ **Hardline stance on China** – blaming it for the U.S. trade deficit and pushing for stricter enforcement of trade agreements

His strategy? **Drive U.S. production up, cut reliance on imports, and force foreign partners to play by his rules.** But markets are worried about **inflation, supply chain disruption, and retaliatory tariffs**—all of which are starting to bite.

Not every company is hurting—some stand to **benefit significantly** from Trump’s protectionist approach. Trump’s tariffs **shield domestic manufacturers from foreign competition**, making U.S. steel, aluminum, and energy companies prime beneficiaries. E.g 

* **U.S. Steel** X 25% steel tariffs will boost profits
* **Cleveland-Cliffs** CLF Increased demand for domestic steel
* **Nucor** NUE Largest U.S. steel producer, stronger pricing power
* **Anheuser-Busch** BUD Domestic production = insulated from trade costs
* **Prologis** PLD Companies stockpiling goods = warehouse demand surge
* **Lockheed Martin** LMT Defense spending likely to rise under Trump
* **Marathon Petroleum** MPC Energy independence push favors domestic refiners

Companies with **complex supply chains** and reliance on **overseas production** are getting squeezed by **higher input costs and potential retaliatory tariffs**.E.g

* **Apple** AAPL Major China exposure, supply chain at risk
* **Tesla** TSLA Higher costs across supply chain, could hurt margins
* **General Motors** GM Tariffs on parts increase manufacturing costs
* **Ford** F Supply chain disruptions could impact production
* **Nike** NKE Manufacturing in China = higher import costs
* **Amazon** AMZN Increased cost of goods from global suppliers
* **Boeing** BA Risk of Chinese retaliation cutting aircraft orders 

Are you positioning for a **domestic manufacturing boom**, or do you think **this trade war will spiral into a full-blown recession**? Should we be **buying the dip** in industrials or **shorting overexposed multinationals**?

  
Trump’s strategy is clear: use **tariffs as a multipurpose weapon**, not just for trade but also for **immigration and national security**. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick hinted that **Canada & Mexico could avoid tariffs if they “improve border security” and crack down on fentanyl trafficking**. This suggests Trump is **negotiating in multiple arenas at once**, using economic pressure to force compliance on broader policy goals.

The problem? **Markets hate uncertainty**, and businesses can’t plan if policy keeps shifting based on unrelated factors. While some U.S. industries benefit, long-term uncertainty could hurt investment, expansion, and consumer confidence.",0,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jfidz3/a_deeper_dive_on_trumps_tariffs_and_market/

I'm a new grad 24F just trying to invest in (mostly) index funds based on my own research, with very poor financial literacy to begin with. I have a ton of questions of course but the main ones I have:
1. What percent in the negatives is considered good to buy at when ""buying low"" (1 understand buying low comes with the risk of them not coming back up but l'm more comfortable with this option because I only have 600$ to put into stocks right now)
2. I'm looking to buy low and probably never sell and just let them grow and add smaller amounts weekly/monthly as my budget allows.
I don't necessarily want to watch to see when stocks are high to sell, If eel like l'd rather just keep buying when lower??? Idk man
3. If a fund is 153$ is one share = 153$. l'm so

Orcl: 15%
Potential contender to buy tik tok, data giant and huge demand for data centers with AI, cash flow machine

Cava: 15%
Huge demand for healthy food, very popular, lots of growth and amazing tasting food. Could be the next chipotle 

Hood (if cheaper):5%
I use it to trade, user friendly, large user base growing fast, mostly young users with huge potential to grow deposits in the future.

Smh: 15%
Semiconductor ETF, Must get into semiconductors they will lead the AI boom.

Meta (@580): 15%
Cashflow machine. Huge user base billions of people. If tik tok ban sticks, insta reels will get a boost. 

NBIS: 2.5%
Risky data center play. Huge cash pile and massive demand. Solid team with proven execution. 

Amzn (@$188): 15%
Undervalued right now, use it all the time. AWS will thrive with AI. Amazing company will be around for years. 

AMD: 2.5%
They’re lagging NVDA, overall risky but they will still grow from AI and could one day develop something to dethrone NVDA. Hopefully they don’t end up like INTC

TSMC: 2.5%
The world’s Fab producer- selling shovels to semiconductor boom. I would have a larger allocation but geopolitical risk is large given china has outright said they will invade Taiwan. 

ADBE: 2.5%
Strong cashflow, wide moat, no other software like it, only getting better with AI integration. Figma acquisition protects moat. 

VGT: 3.75%
Overall investing in tech as a whole, low risk etf. 

MSFT 3.75%
Their monopoly with teams and the whole Microsoft ecosystem is extremely sticky. And their stake in open AI has allowed them to integrate all their products with AI like co pilots. AI will only improve and MSFT will be the first to benefit from it. 

LUCK:5%
Risky consumer discretionary if recession occurs. Large debt load. Their bowling alleys have strong demand and it’s a stable business in good times with a lot of real estate assets.

Palantir has been on a tear recently, all hyped up on the defense sector growth but no one is really paying attention to Meta Defense and their entry to the space. Last year Meta opened up its AI models to defense agencies and contractors. This is huge for them to get this level of clearance and i think this will will put them in direct competition with Palantir. Im not sure how they build out this branch of Meta, Im calling it Meta Defense but they fired all their woke people and are starting to re-shape the company.

Yes, there is defense spending cuts but its all on waste and overcharged contracts not on things that actually matter for the dept of defense. During the inauguration Zuckerberg was in the front row, Hegseth was somewhere in the back. Just an observation.

Everyone is familiar with their social media business so there isnt a whole lot to talk about there. AI keeps improving, More growth from Reels, Threads, Facebook. Their LLM is impressive and arguably one of the best, putting them up there with OpenAI.

With all there user data they have Meta Analytics could be another source of revenue.

They are sitting on a goldmine with Facebook market place. i get they have ads but i feel they could do more.  Im not sure Zuckerberg realized what he has there but this business if monetized right could be HUGE.

News: [Us Initial Jobless Claims Pick Up But Stay Relatively Low](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-06/us-initial-jobless-claims-pick-up-but-stay-relatively-low)

**Ticker:** [**F (Ford Motor Company)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=F&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Ford Motor Company reports .39 vs .34 expected, revenue of $48.2 vs 43.6B expected. Announces that profit could fall by $2B or more due to tariffs and lower EV demand.

**Technicals:** Pretty much broke the $10 level it's been trading around since August, watching to see if it'll sell off more by the open. Highly/infinitely liquid.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The entire automotive industry is challenged by tariffs. F guided lower for 2025.

**Risks:** Obviously these are one of the bigger movers from Mexico tariffs (most cars are assembled in Mexico then shipped to the US).

**Related Tickers:** GM, TSLA, STLA.

**Offhand Comments:** Ford's outlook reflects the broader industry's apprehension about geopolitical factors affecting operations and profitability. Interesting to see how other car companies react to earnings as well.

**Ticker:** [**ARM (Arm Holdings)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ARM&p=d)

**Catalyst:** ARM reported EPS of $0.39 vs. $0.34 expected. Revenue of $983 million vs. $959M expected. Buoyed by Deepseek ban news, most likely as well.

**Technicals:** Was down roughly 8% after earnings, but seems to be somewhat recovering after Deepseek news.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Semiconductor sector is experiencing heightened demand, especially after PLTR's comments that the AI train will never stop. We're seeing growth in data center applications, the main driver of semis purchases.

**Risks:** Despite strong performance, Arm's lowered full-year revenue forecast has led to a 6% drop in its shares.

**Related Tickers:** NVDA, AMD, INTC.

**Ticker:** [**RBLX (Roblox Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RBLX&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Roblox Corporation reported earnings with an EPS of -$0.33 vs. -$0.46 expected. Revenue of $988.2M vs. $967.2M expected.

**Technicals:** $50 is the clear level here, note that earnings were released premarket rather than aftermarket yesterday. Seems to be a massive overreaction selloff (but has recovered somewhat).

**Risks:** IIRC Roblox isn't profitable yet- they're focusing on growth/revenue over profits, but most of their costs are outside their control (platform fees like the Apple store, developers, infrastructure for trust/safety for minors).

**Related Tickers:** EA, TTWO.

**Ticker:** [**NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** DeepSeek, a Chinese AI start-up, has temporarily suspended its API service top-ups due to server resource constraints. Additionally, U.S. lawmakers plan to introduce a bill to ban DeepSeek's chatbot application from government-owned devices over data security concerns.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The AI industry is under increased scrutiny regarding data security and geopolitical tensions but that's grown more laissez-faire under Trump. DeepSeek's service suspension and potential U.S. government ban helps American chip makers and NVDA especially, due to their continued dominance.

**Risks:** Deepseek getting banned will likely lead to greater reliance on American AI chatbots, spurring growth in American semis manufacturers.

**Related Tickers:** AMD, INTC, QCOM.

**Offhand Comments:** (I am currently long).

**Ticker:** [**SWKS (Skyworks Solutions)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SWKS&p=d)

**Catalyst:** EPS of $1.60 vs. $1.57 expected. Revenue of $1.07B vs 1.07B expected. Reports $2B stock buyback plan.

**Technicals:** Watching the $60 level, we've had a brutal fall from $90->$60. If we get closer I'm interested in some small bounce depending on volume/size of the move.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** SWKS supplies some of the chips for Apple's iPhone, and their iPhone sales haven't done too well recently- thus this has a knock-on effect by affecting SWKS's sales.

**Risks:** SWKS projected a revenue decline for the mobile segment and issued a lower profit forecast. They stated they anticipated a ""mid-to-high teens decline in mobile.""

**Offhand Comments: A lot of the firms that manufacture parts for the iPhone are linked in performance, especially if the iPhone is the main source of their sales- would be interesting to formulate some trading ideas from that.**

**Ticker:** [**PLTR (Palantir Technologies Inc)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Reported earnings of $0.14 vs. $0.11 expected. Revenue of $828 million vs. $777 million expected. Management highlighted the power of AI and their sizable contracts, citing the nature of the AI war being winner-take-all.

**Technicals:** PLTR absolutely exploded and hit $102 premarket, currently watching $100 level to see if we continue the move. Other than that unlikely to be trading this unless we have massive volume come in.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The PLTR ER highlighted the growing demand for AI-driven solutions across government/commercial sectors. Company emphasized securing substantial contracts in the competitive AI landscape, important because they are more closely aligned with the current government.

**Risks:** Obviously being more closely tied to the government means that it has more leeway to be more monopolistic/aggresive in their actions, Alex Karp and Peter Thiel are closely aligned with current government leaders.

**Related Tickers:** MSFT, GOOGL, IBM, AMZN

**Ticker:** [**NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Chinese AI company DeepSeek is reportedly preparing to switch to domestic GPUs to circumvent NVDA chip restrictions. DeepSeek has bypassed NVDA CUDA for certain operations, utilizing the PTX (Parallel Thread Execution) language instead. Additionally, on February 2nd, DeepSeek, in collaboration with SiliconFlow and Huawei Cloud, launched DeepSeek-R1/V3 inference services on Huawei's Ascend AI chips. Huawei is also promoting its new Ascend AI processors to Chinese groups considering ""inference"" as an option.

**Technicals:** After the insane move we've seen from $150 to $118, I actually don't consider this to be earth shattering news- China has always been trying to develop their own semis and not using NVDA for training is what they were ""supposed"" to be doing due to the trade restrictions. I'm still long but selling calls against my position, recovery might be slow for NVDA. It's interesting that they are attempting to bypass CUDA, which is essentially the ""standard"" for ML/AI training nowadays on NVDA chips and developing their own.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** DeepSeek's move to adopt domestic GPUs and bypass CUDA indicates they're aiming for technological self-reliance amidst U.S. export restrictions, rather than trying to adopt more NVDA chips (which presumably isn't a viable long term strategy).

**Risks:** Nvidia faces potential revenue loss if Chinese companies increasingly adopt domestic GPUs and alternative programming frameworks. The effectiveness of U.S. export controls may be undermined as Chinese firms develop workarounds.

**Catalyst:** U.S. implemented a 10% tariff on all Chinese imports, aiming to address issues related to drug trafficking, particularly fentanyl. In response, China announced retaliatory tariffs effective February 10, including a 15% tariff on U.S. coal and liquefied natural gas, and a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery, and large-engine vehicles.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The imposition of these tariffs marks a significant escalation in U.S.-China trade tension and more volatility to come through Trump tweets- we might see a trade war again (sigh) like we did in 2019. Not 100% sure if agricultural machinery will affect stocks like DE but will look into it.

They underperformed the S&P500 (before their fee), and almost all positions are just S&P500 companies anyways, so I figured if I went 100% into an S&P index on my own I can't do worse.

I'm not sure how best to proceed with the current number of individual stocks. There are 64 positions total and it's unrealistic that I'll be able to keep track of the performance/trajectory of that many companies. Buffet's ""pick a few winners"" comes to mind. I've been assuming the best thing to do is to slowly liquidate the one's I don't have a specific interest in, and buy VOO/SPY in their place.

There are many companies that I like and would like to hold on to (AAPL, AMD, AMZN, BRKB, GOOGL, JNJ, KO, MSFT, NVDA, NFLX, PG). However, the majority are S&P 500 companies that I don't follow closely (ABT, ADBE, AMAT, AMGN, AMT, AVGO, AZN, BA, BMY, CAT, COP, CRM, CVX, ... to name a few). It's not that I don't know those companies, but it feels ignorant to hold onto them knowing that I won't have time to monitor their performance.

Is there a best way to go about liquidating those and moving into an S&P 500 index? Initial temptation is gambler's fallacy (sell the low performers first and keep the better ones a bit longer).",3,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1i8mzb1/switched_from_ameriprise_managed_account_to/

Amazon isn’t just an e-commerce giant; it’s an ecosystem with diverse revenue streams that touch nearly every part of our lives. From its robust retail operations and cloud computing powerhouse AWS to its advertising business, device sales, and subscription services like Prime, Amazon has mastered the art of innovation and scale.

One of my favorite aspects is Amazon Prime, a service that bundles so much value into one membership. Beyond free shipping, Prime offers access to Prime Video, music streaming, exclusive deals, and more—making it a must-have for millions of households globally.

A recent highlight from Prime Video is its record-breaking performance in NFL streaming. The Steelers-Ravens playoff game brought in an impressive 22.07 million average viewers, setting a new high for Amazon’s sports streaming efforts. While this figure lags behind Netflix’s Christmas Day NFL stream and traditional broadcasters like Fox and CBS for other playoff games, it’s a significant milestone. More importantly, Amazon’s partnership with the NFL is driving Prime subscriptions and ad revenue. Their Thursday Night Football viewership grew 13% year-over-year in 2024, showcasing their ability to compete in the fiercely contested live sports space.

Looking ahead, this is just the beginning for Amazon. With its unique ability to blend commerce, media, and technology, their continued investment in live sports and other high-impact content will be transformative—not just for Prime Video but for the entire ecosystem.

2024-12-04 19:51:54,Amazon,AMZN,"Intel’s CEO shakeup puts foundry plans, CHIPS Act cash at risk","Intel (INTC) is in crisis. The company forced out CEO Pat Gelsinger on Monday, its stock price is down more than 50% on the year, and the grand plan to add third-party semiconductor manufacturing to its repertoire is suddenly more unclear than ever.

Gelsinger’s gambit to transform Intel into a US-based version of Taiwan’s TSMC that builds chips for its rivals is one of the reasons the company received $7.8 billion in CHIPS Act funding. But the foundry business, which it plans to operate as an independent subsidiary, has been hemorrhaging money and its biggest customer is still Intel itself.

Yes, the company has picked up deals to build chips for Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN), but that hasn’t quelled calls for Intel to kill its third-party foundry plan. Bank of America Global Research analyst Vivek Arya wrote in an investor note that Intel could go as far as fully separating its design and manufacturing businesses.

But ditching its fabs, or fabrication facilities, is a lot easier said than done, especially if Intel wants to hold on to those CHIPS Act funds.

“They just got the CHIPS Acts money. And if you look very closely at the details, it basically says that Intel cannot sell more than a controlling share of the manufacturing footprint,” explained Mario Morales, group vice president of enabling technologies and semiconductors at IDC. “So that means that Intel will have to maintain manufacturing control of their capacity.”

In other words, there’s no easy path forward for the US’s largest homegrown chip builder.

The Commerce Department and Intel announced the chipmaker would be getting CHIPS Act funding just last week, with the DoC saying the cash would help Intel expand its manufacturing capacity in the US, a key part of Gelsinger’s plan to help the company compete with TSMC and Samsung, two of the largest chipmakers in the world.

Gelsinger initially unveiled the ambitious agenda, called IDM 2.0, or integrated device manufacturing 2.0, in 2021, the same year he took the reins as CEO. At the time, he said Intel would create a world-class foundry business. But Gelsinger took over an Intel beset by problems.

Lack of investment and missed opportunities over the years meant the company failed to catch the mobile wave and fell behind TSMC in design capabilities. And building out a global manufacturing footprint isn’t cheap, which, for a company that was already hurting, wasn’t ideal.

Gelsinger had four years to make the turnaround happen, and while Intel’s chip design process is catching up, building chip manufacturing facilities takes time, more than Intel’s board seemed interested in giving Gelsinger.

“Some of the problems that Intel had, and still has, are not things you can solve overnight. They are multiyear issues,” said TECHnalysis founder and chief analyst Bob O’Donnell.

“Gelsinger started on a path to follow some of these things. And I think ultimately, at the highest level, what he chose to do, which is to get the manufacturing stuff back in shape and to work on design, is ultimately what the company needs to do.”

Now Intel has to make a decision: carry on with Gelsinger’s plan or cut back and focus on its own chip building capabilities or give up the business entirely. But doing that means saying goodbye to CHIPS Act money unless it can get approval from the Commerce Department

Under the terms of the CHIPS Act agreement, Intel is prohibited from certain change of control transactions. If the company spins off its foundry business, it has to hold on to at least 50.1% of the voting rights of the entity if it’s a private company. If the new entity goes public, a third party can’t own 35% or more of it. That means Intel can’t simply cut its foundry business loose and go fabless if it wants to hold on to that CHIPS money.

But moving forward with the foundry model could be difficult.

“I think as a combined entity it's hard to survive, because the biggest problem is your potential customers for foundry are all your competitors against Intel products,” explained Gartner analyst Gaurav Gupta. “So how would they have trust in Intel foundry and become its customers, right?”

If Intel does end up pulling back on its third-party manufacturing ambitions, however, it could end up eating a good portion of the losses.

“You'd have to scale back. You'd have to lay off people. I'm sure there would be some sunk cost, but the alternative is you keep losing billions of dollars a quarter,” Citi head of US semiconductor research Chris Danely told Yahoo Finance. “So, I think you just need to scrap it. Take your lumps. If you have to, return the money to the government.”

While Danely believes Intel should drop its goal of serving as a global foundry for other companies, he says it should continue to build its own chips.

“I still think they should manufacture their own CPUs,” he explained. ""There's been speculation for a long time that they're just going to turn the keys over to [TSMC] and have [TSMC] make everything. We don't think that that's the right move.”

Before that, however, Intel needs to find a new permanent CEO.

2024-10-26 11:55:44,Amazon,AMZN,What’s the stock you’ll never sell,"Our investment philosophy and goals usually depend on our age. You probably wouldn’t accept the same risk at 20 than at 60, especially if your stock portfolio is part of your retirement plan.

I agree with a value investing philosophy, so to me never selling implies the original investment thesis doesn’t change. 

I think we could have an interesting discussion if we share our age (or age range) and the company in which we trust for the rest of our lives (and why).

I’m in my 30s, so assuming I live for the next 50 years, I believe Lockheed Martin ($LMT) will remain an important player in the defense sector, as I expect war (mostly proxy wars) to continue being used for political interests and if the US DoD sees its budget reduced, our current Western society’s paradigm will be over.

Other candidates I’ve considered are Visa ($V), Microsoft ($MSFT) and Amazon ($AMZN), but I could see all those titans being disrupted someday in the next 50 years.

2. The second round is based on the actual current size of revenue & total equity growth. Generally it must be at least +30% rev & eq combined

3. Third round, consistency. Any ""weird"" financials, inconsistencies are tossed

4. Soft fourth for value, taking into account PEG and other price:financial metrics

2024-10-08 08:57:47,Amazon,AMZN,Wells Fargo downgrades Amazon on slowing growth expectations & Walmart competition,"Amazon Inc. shares fell on Monday, following a rare analyst downgrade that cited concerns over margin trends into next year, which growth in the cloud computing business is unlikely to compensate for.

Wells Fargo Securities cut the stock to equal weight from overweight, with analyst Ken Gawrelski becoming one of the few analysts tracked by Bloomberg who doesn’t have a buy recommendation on the stock. He also cut his price target from $225 to $183, one of the lowest on Wall Street.

2024-10-01 15:23:05,Amazon,AMZN,The Crash of the stock market has arrived. Price/Earnings ratio just broke 30 for the entire S&P 500. ,"Almost 90 days ago I made a post in an alternate subreddit regarding why I believe the stock market will begin to crash within 120 days -- Essentially the crash will begin by the day before the election. I have included that entire post below -- and all of these reasons still remain relevant... Moreso than ever with the news from the Middle East today. Obviously the port strike is expediting things today. Nonetheless -- I think the post is super relevant, and for some reason, the moderators of WSB deleted the post after 6 hours, despite it receiving over 2.2 million views, and over 1100 shares. 

The ride the market has been on, quite simply, has been insane.

According to generally accepted wisdom -- by investing in the S&P 500, you can anticipate to double your money, on average, every 6.5 years. I'm not 100% certain as to why that's the accepted figure -- as calculating the last 14 6.5 year periods the average rate of return has been 64%.

Below is a chart of the average price/rate of return of GSPC (The S&P) over the last 14 cycles.. I couldn't easily find data prior to this..

|Year|GSPC Price|6.5 year return on investment|
|:-|:-|:-|
||
|1933.5|10.91||
|1940|12.05|10.44%|
|1946.5|18.43|52.95%|
|1953|26.38|43.13%|
|1959.5|58.68|122%|
|1966|92.88|58%|
|1972.5|107.14|15%|
|1979|99.93|-7.22%|
|1985.5|191.85|91.90%|
|1992|408.78|113%|
|1998.5|1133.84|177%|
|2005|1181.27|4.10%|
|2011.5|1320.64|11.70%|
|2018|2471.65|87.10%|
|2024.5|5525.29|123%|

While the last two cycles don't necessarily ring any alarm bells -- we have just more than doubled, twice, looking at the last two cycles -- There is one massive, bloated, shit filled elephant in the room... Price to Earnings Ratio.

Historically, the Price to Earnings ratio for the S&P has sat just under 20 (the easiest data I could find puts it at 19.4x between 1974 and 2017 -- I'm not grabbing any arbitrary dates or numbers here). The Median value has it under 18x, and there have even been extended periods of time where it traded at +/- 10x.

Currently -- the P/E ratio sits at 28.71 -- roughly 150% of what is normal.

In the history of the S&P, the P/E ratio has hit this level only 3 times...

* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Dot Com Bubble (P/E broke 30 +/- April 2001).
* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Global Financial Crisis (P/E broke 30 +/- October 2008).
* The quarter after Covid hit. (P/E broke 30 +/- March 2020).

Images aren't allowed in this subreddit -- but if you go to the multpl website you will see we finished trading yesterday, 09/30, at a P/E of 30.07

Historically -- what has happened to the markets after crossing this mark? In all three scenarios, by the time we crossed a P/E of 30, the dam had already started to break.

* During the Dot Com bubble, the S&P 500 was already down 19% from its highs, and would fall another 34% before finally starting to recover. By the the time the bleeding stopped, it had lost 47% of its value.
* During the global financial crisis, an almost identical story can be told. The S&P had lost 18% of its value by time P/E broke 30, and when it finally bottomed out in February of 2009, it lost 53% of its total value.
* Covid, obviously, was a much quicker recovery... as we only fell 32%, and had bounced back in less than 6 months time (reason for which outlined later).

**Okay -- so** ***Maybe*** **we have a price to earnings ratio problem, but you're still not sold. What else do we have going on?**

Outside of the fact that I firmly believe that the market is overvalued today, I think there are several other major issues that we are facing in the current environment -- and while I could write a diatribe for each, for purposes of succinctness, I'll simply outline them via bullet points below.

* Credit card debt is at an all time high, and outside of a brief period after Covid checks arrived, has been rising since 2013.
* Younger Americans are in the most trouble with credit card debt. As boomers continue to retire, it will be the working class most disproportionately affected.
* Credit card delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2011.
* Auto loans debt and average auto loan payments are the highest they've been at any point in history. Auto loan delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2010.
* The stock market is insanely top heavy right now. The Magnificent 7 (Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA)) now account for 45% of the entire value of the Nasdaq. They account for roughly 30% of the entire stock market combined. As of today -- they are trading at a combined P/E of 42x. A correction in these 7 companies would be absolutely catastrophic for the entire market as a whole.
* We are starting to see a weakening of the labor market. Furthermore -- I do not believe the jobs numbers are entirely as they seem. I think many of the jobs 'added' over the last 18 months have been individuals picking up second jobs to help make ends meet. Any reasonable increase in the unemployment rate have absolutely massive consequences.
* Many banks are holding on to massive unrealized losses. While this has the potential to hit the regional banks the worst, some of the largest banks -- including Bank of America, Charles Schwab, and USAA have unbooked security losses that are greater than 50% of their equity capital.
* Regional banks are at risk due to the massive amounts of US treasury notes they hold that were bought during Covid. In short -- nobody was borrowing money to buy homes or cars. Banks, flush with cash, took said money and bought US T notes with this money so they could earn some interest on it. This was at a time when interest rates were very low. Now that interest rates are high -- demand for these old t notes is essentially non existent, as you buy new t notes that pay a much higher rate of return. If any sort of bank run starts, these banks will be forced to liquidate said t-bills, and they will have to sell them at a loss. If too many people do this simultaneously, the bank will become insolvent -- like what we saw happen with Silicon Valley bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank. (Side note -- the failure of these three banks alone was larger than the combined total of bank failures in 2008 during the global financial crisis).
* The US government still has a spending problem. Our deficit has grown by $500 million since I started writing this an hour ago.
* Global tensions are high -- and rising. Massive protests are erupting all over Europe.
* The US is involved in two proxy wars that don't appear as if they will abate any time soon.
* The political division in the US is as dramatic as I've seen it at any point in my existence. Perhaps those older and wiser than me can chime in here -- but it seems most are resorting to tribal, identity politics split down party lines.
* Commercial real estate is starting to buckle. Covid brought about work from home, and with many offices retaining those practices, or allowing partial work from home, office space supply far outpaces demand. This problem is exacerbated by high interest rates. Most commercial loans are done on 5 or 7 year balloon. When that balloon is bout to come due, the owner of that property will refinance the loan, restarting the 5 or 7 year period to avoid paying off the balance owed on the property. Many of these property owners that refinanced into low interest rates in 2020, during covid, when rates bottomed out -- are now having to get a new loan to keep from paying their balloon. However, with interest rates more than twice what they were several years ago, and vacancy rates skyrocketing, many of these real estate owners will not be able to pay the monthly mortgage on their buildings. Commercial Real Estate foreclosures jumped 117% in March alone.
* Housing has become increasingly less affordable for many Americans. For 2022 -- the most recent year I could find data -- a family earning the median US household income, renting a median priced US home, was spending 40% of their income on rent.
* Countries are abandoning the US dollar in droves.

I believe some of these issues, on their own, are enough to cause serious economic turmoil. Bundled together, I don't see how we aren't in for a very rude awakening.

**This economic downturn may be severe.**

In the three times this has happened before -- the action, or lake thereof varied dramatically. During scenario one -- the dot com bubble -- the government largely just let the companies fail. While I was only 11 at the time, my understanding is that there really were no bailouts here because the only people really hurt were the investors in those companies -- unlike scenario two. During the GFC, shuttering banks would have resulted in a complete collapse of the US (and really global) financial system. While I won't get into partisan politics, I'm of the belief that the covid bailouts were entirely unnecessary -- and more importantly for this post -- the reason that the upcoming crash is going to be so insanely problematic.

**Bailouts on any level, whether to companies, banks, or directly to citizens, will inevitably increase inflation. I don't think they are on the table for this correction.**

People have painted the inflation problem as a result of supply chain issues... And while supply chain issues didn't help, I think the bigger issue, by far, was the sheer amount of money we printed. You cannot make $4 trillion appear out of thin air and expect that every dollar in circulation isn't going to suddenly become worth less money. We just lived through this reality after the Covid printing.

This will largely tie the feds hands. Print more money -- we find ourselves in a cycle of ever increasing prices and higher interest rates.

**What happens from here?**

I don't know. Don't listen to me. I'm an idiot. Stock market will probably just continue to go up. I'm probably wrong about 100% of this.

The prediction in bold below is what I posted 90 days ago. I now believe the top is officially in -- that we won't see another ATH for a long time. 

**My Prediction? GSPC/SPY cruise up a tiny bit further, to +/- $5900/$590 -- before retreating to $3500/$350 by 12/2025.**

2024-09-27 10:04:39,Amazon,AMZN,'Safety Disaster:' Tesla FSD 'Galaxies Away From Being Anywhere Close To Competition',"* Tesla's FSD, which is now promoted as fully-supervised, is now the core technology behind the robotaxi service the company plans to launch.
* Most analysts assign hefty value for the FSD technology alone.

  
With just two weeks to go for Tesla, Inc.’s TSLA Robotaxi unveil event, an analyst painted a bleak picture of the company’s self-driving technology.



**What Happened**: Tesla’s FSD, which is now promoted as fully-supervised FSD, is a “safety disaster” and “galaxies away from being anywhere close to the competition,” said GLJ Research’s Gordon Johnson in a note. Tesla’s competitors in this arena are Alphabet, Inc.’s GOOGL GOOG Waymo and General Motors Corp.’s GM Cruise.



With Tesla eyeing the rollout of its Fully Supervised FSD in China, the Elon Musk-led company would be up against domestic player Baidu, Inc.’s BIDU Apollo Go.



Johnson referenced reviews by two sources to make his case. Independent lab AMCI Testing, which tried the technology, said the overall performance of Tesla’s camera-enabled autonomous-driving software is “suspect.” In a report released on Tuesday, the firm said its evaluation showed how often human intervention was required for safe operation. “In fact, our drivers had to intervene over 75 times during the evaluation; an average of once every 13 miles,” it said.



While the FSD 12.5.1 was impressive, it is incredibly dangerous for drivers operating with FSD to drive with their hands in their laps or away from the steering wheels, it said. “The most critical moments of FSD miscalculation are split-second events that even professional drivers, operating with a test mindset, must focus on catching,” it added.



Johnson also referred to data from [Teslafsdtracker.com](http://Teslafsdtracker.com), which aggregates TSLA FSD driving experiences/data, in real-time from users, which shows that the latest iteration of FSD has a **critical disengagement every 130 miles and every 72 miles when driven in a city.**

  
Data reported by competitors to the California Department of Motor Vehicles show that miles to disengagement data for various players are as follows:

* Waymo: 17,311 miles
* **Amazon, Inc.’s** AMZN Zoox: 177,602 miles
* [Pony.Ai](http://Pony.Ai) (startup): 17,077 miles
* WeRide (startup): 21,191 miles

The **metric for Tesla is 13 miles**, based on AMCI’s statistics, Johnson said, although Tesla doesn’t yet report data to California DMV, given its FSD tech is **only Level 2.**  


**Why It’s Important:** Johnson noted that many sell-side analysts assign a valuation of $300 billion to $600 billion for Tesla’s FSD technology. In real-time, the value is close to zero, he said, adding that it could be negative, given the “liability of putting something this dangerous on roads.”

  
According to Ark’s valuation model, by 2029, robotaxis, which has FSD as its core technology, would account for 63% of Tesla’s revenue and 86% of EBITDA.

Future Fund LLC Managing Partner Gary Black, a Tesla bull, said in a recent post on X that Tesla's FSD is not yet close to the 99.99% efficacy needed for unsupervised autonomy.



In premarket trading on Thursday, Tesla rose 2.05% to $262.30

2024-09-18 14:34:47,Amazon,AMZN,Wash sale rule Explanation- Am I understanding this right?,"I made a lot of trades in 2024, I was up 50k at one point and then gave back almost all the profit and I am only up around 4k currently for 2024. I am assuming I only have to pay capital gains taxes on 4k profit for the year, not 50k or some figure more than my overall gains of 4k because of wash sale rule. I did lot of day trading and buying same stock within 30 days of selling and I wanted to understand the implications of wash sale rule. I currently have sold all my positions and do not hold any stock/options and I am up 4k on the year.

Example 1: I bought NVDA calls on August 14, sold on August 15 for gains of 5k. Then I bought NVDA calls on August 20 and sold on August 25 for loss of 3k. I did this several times with NVDA stock and options and have profit of 20k from NVDA and loss of 19k with overall net gain of around 1k on NVDA. I am trying to understand wash sale rule and my understanding is I only have to pay capital gains taxes for 1k on NVDA. My cost basis on my second purchase gets adjusted from profit on first purchase and my cost basis for third purchase gets adjusted based on profit/loss from second sell and so on for future purchase. Is this correct statement? Also, I currently do not hold any NVDA stocks or options, I sold them all.

Example 2: I did same thing with AMZN stock too. I bought calls, sold for some loss, bought more calls within 30 days and sold for some profit and rinse and repeat. I did this multiple times throughout the year.

I traded mostly tech stocks and at one point was in profit in excess of 50k. However I did not sell at the top and the stocks came crashing down and I lost all my profit. At one point I lost all profit and was 20k down on my cost basis too. I was able to recover my loss and I am up 4k in the year. I am now thinking about my Uncle sam and how much does he want for 2024. With no current positions in any stock/options currently, my thinking is just taxes on 4k profit. Let me know if I am wrong or if there is something that I am overlooking and if I need to put more money away for my taxes.",0,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1fjuboe/wash_sale_rule_explanation_am_i_understanding/

2024-09-10 22:33:30,Amazon,AMZN,Amazon passed Google as 4th largest in S&P 500,"“Amazon stock was rising on Tuesday, just enough to maintain its place as the S&P 500’s fourth-largest company by market value after overtaking Alphabet on Monday. It may owe Oracle a little bit of a thank you.

Shares of Amazon.com were up 2.6% at 2:09 p.m. on Monday, after rising 2.3% on Monday. With Monday’s move, Amazon passed Alphabet as the fourth-largest company in the U.S. for the first time since April 5. Alphabet’s stock has fallen 8.7% in September, while Amazon is off just 0.7%. Amazon’s market cap was $22 billion more than Alphabet’s at Monday’s close, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

Amazon had some good news for investors at an investor conference, noting that its cloud business, AWS, is gaining further traction in AI but that it’s also focused on “balancing expenditures with revenue growth,” according to BofA analyst Justin Post.

There was also good news from Oracle’s earnings. Yes, most of the good news was for Oracle stock, which has risen 12% on Thursday. But with the release of its earnings, Oracle and AWS said that they had come together with a new cloud product, Oracle Database@AWS. Oracle already has partnerships with Microsoft’s Azure and Google, but Post notes that the AWS/Oracle deal should be good for both companies. “Oracle & AMZN had been competitive for database customers, so new partnership suggests companies have a lot to gain by working together,” he writes.

Right now investors will just settle for gains.”

2024-09-05 13:45:35,Amazon,AMZN,Walgreens is a easy buyout target,"And I think Amazon should buy them.

Drug stores have evolved from the time they first popped up and people love shopping there because its, convenient.  

Pros

-Amazon is an online retailer with no real retail space yet. Their first stores weren't done right. 

-Amazon already has an online medical clinic(One Medical) and pharmacy business that could be easily integrated together.

-Amazon with their analytics could easily stock each store and location with the right products from their online inventory making each store more profitable.

-Amazon has high shipping/delivery costs and growing each year. people are starting to have a package theft issue. Your local store can easily become a pick up spot of your packages, safely. Whole foods stores are very limited for pick up, same with pick up lockers. 

-Would also be a good returns spot, no need for Kohls or UPS eating into costs. 

-Could have bigger stores in some locations for a bigger variety of products and services. Kroger's has some grocery stores and some marketplace stores. Amazon is essentially a giant warehouse that has to ship everything to your doorstep. 

-Amazon is launching a Shein and Temu competitor, stores could easily offer cheaper products in the right neighborhoods. What usually deters people from making a purchase is the shipping cost, nobody wants to order $35 of stuff just to avoid the shipping fee, plus tax.  



-Walgreens 

	-more than 8,700 retail locations across the U.S.

	-annual revenue for 2023 was $1451B, Amzn makes this in a quarter

	  (1) Pharmacy:	         $87B 60%

	  (2) Retail:	         $37B 26%

	  (3) Wholesale & Others:$20B 14%

	-Walgreens owns Alliance Boots, a retail pharmacy/beauty store across the UK: https://www.boots-uk.com/about-boots-uk/our-purpose-and-values/our-stores/ 

	-Boots owns The No7 Beauty Company:  https://www.no7company.com/

	-Most importantly Walgreens has ALOT if not most of their stores in busy high traffic areas making their locations valuable and offers convenience shopping. 

	

Cons

-Walgreens has $32B in debt

-Might need regulatory approval but Whole Foods got approved so this shouldn't be much of a problem 

-Will likely need to close some unprofitable stores and sell the land or transform them into something else



This deal makes more sense than Amazon buying Whole Foods, and they already have this retail experience. If Amazon doesn't make an offer i think a private equity company will take it private and turn the business around. 



I like the stock. Amazons acquisition would revitalize the brand and bring new excitement if done right.  Bought some shares because they are cheap and this is way over sold.

2024-08-01 18:13:46,Amazon,AMZN,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

|+|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|Company|Current Price|Price Target|Percent to Target|Total Ratings|# Strong Buy Ratings|# Buy Ratings|% of Ratings that were Strong Buys|

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

I’m currently 24, just graduated with a bachelors in accounting, going for my MACC degree next. I should be done and ready for the workforce this time next year, hopefully!

I have been investing consistently through university, I have gotten passed my new milestone of $21k+

$COST
$TSLA
$GOOG
$AMZN
$MSFT 


I have the Roth set up with just VOO & SCHD and have been reinvesting every dividend payout for the past 2 years! 

I hope to hit $100k in stocks before I hit 30 and then I’m going to start buying land and have a savings account (7% interest) in Guatemala. Once done with that, coming back to buy a duplex over here and hopefully house hack so I can lower my expenses and hit my FIRE goals by 45 years old. 2045 is my retirement goal.

2024-07-12 22:29:19,Amazon,AMZN,My Bull Case for AMZN,"Hello all, currently AMZN is a significant part of my portfolio because…

They are the biggest player in cloud serving. AWS (Amazon Web Services) is the backbone for many companies. Look at Netflix: it would take them 3+ years to transition out of using AWS, so they probably won’t do that. Amazon can up their charges to these companies, much like how Apple can within the App Store. And the bigger these companies get, the more money Amazon makes.

Amazon is a diversified company. When I buy an Amazon share, I am buying a technology, entertainment, and retail business. So to see it as one uniform business doesn’t make much sense.

They are investing so much into AI infrastructure that they could potentially be one of the most benefited companies from AI. 

Their PE ratio instills doubt into a lot of investors; on paper it looks like an expensive company currently. However, the reason why that is, is because they underreport earnings. They reinvest so much into their business, and this expense hurts net income, thus high PE. However, they will gradually report more and more net income and the E in PE will look a lot better. Now is the time to buy, when investors are discouraged by the high PE. Just buy now and hold for 20 years.

Trading out of line with Mag 7 (which is expected due to car sale numbers), but will be looking for appropriate places to short if they occur. If we spike off the open then I’ll try to be agile and short/cover where appropriate.
- [AMZN](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMZN&p=d) - Took advantage of the CPI spike and exited out half of part of my AMZN position, will hold rest back to a stop at 199. Other than that, still holding half. We DID open at a lower low today (but that can partially be attributed to CPI). Will likely remove this after today.

I currently have: 
1 AMZN 
1 AAPL 
6 INTC 
10 RIVN 
1 HOOD 
2 SYM 
1 Tesla 
Some VOO

I work for an automotive manufacturer and already own some of that stock and it’s a conflict for me to own competitor stocks so that area is out. 

I would like a good long term hold that is in an area of cd that has some decent room for growth with promising technicals and decent fundamentals, preferably large cap. 

I already own AMZN, and have funds in the consumer discretionary ETF, IEDI. I could put this 8-10k in that ETF, or find a decent company to buy and hold. 

I’m also considering selling the AMZN which is in IEDI and putting it all into that basket

2024-05-24 13:50:05,Amazon,AMZN,Moving on from AAPL,"So, I had an excellent ride on AAPL for a good long bit, but bit a bit Meh on it concerning it's YTD performance , and what I see as a lot of lackluster reviews of it's recent product offerings and choices.  Thinner ipad, who cares?  New chip, no software yet to take advantage of it probably for the better part of a year.  Virt Reality, no killer app to drive it.  AI, they seem to be late in their development, although Apple has always been the greatest at their catchup/surpassing game.  I think there maybe better options for me, looking for a sounding board.  Still looking to keep it in steadily plodding behemoths for ease of mind, but something better than flat YTD performance i got out of apple this year.

First up MSFT, up 14% YTD, has a wide moat, seems to be well positioned for AI, although their gaming sector is looking kinda soft to me.  Like their latest offerings in pc with infused AI, and tablet.

Next up AMZN, up 21% YTD, also a wide moat, with a lot of stability in their supplied items and businesses.  Nothing really lights up the sky, just plodding along.  I think they have an AI strength used in their background business, but has an appearance of hiding, as it has no consumer face to it.

Lastly NVDA, up 110% YTD.  They are definitely the star of the moment, and I think there is still gas in this tank, but being a hardware vendor mostly with some software driven solutions for AI for their platform alone, they may have locked up a good lead that will only grow.

Looking at doing a 50/25/25 split (MSFT/AMZN/NVDA), thoughts?  Would love to hear any positive or negative on this.

","*Consumers will soon have access to* [*yet another streaming bundle*](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-streaming-wars-are-over-morning-brief-100018167.html)*. Comcast (*[*CMCSA*](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CMCSA)*) CEO Brian Roberts said early Tuesday that later this month, the company will launch a new offering that combines its Peacock platform, Netflix (*[*NFLX*](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NFLX/?fr=sycsrp_catchall)*), and Apple TV+ (*[*AAPL*](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/?fr=sycsrp_catchall)*).*

*""We've been bundling video successfully and creatively for 60 years,"" he added. ""This is the latest iteration of that, and I think this will be a pretty compelling package.""*

2024-05-08 07:22:15,Amazon,AMZN,Amazon breaks into Europe 5G networks with Telefonica cloud deal,"STOCKHOLM, May 8 (Reuters) - Telefonica Germany (TEF.MC) will move one million 5G customers to Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud later this month, company executives told Reuters, in a bold move by the U.S. online retailer to break into the global telecoms market.

While some telecom networks have moved IT and other non-core operations to the public cloud, the move by the subsidiary of Spanish group Telefonica is a global first where an existing mobile operator is switching its core network to a public cloud.

Big cloud-computing services firms such as Amazon (AMZN.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) have been trying to move more into the telecoms sector, lured by billions of dollars in potential revenue, but operators have been wary of the capability of public clouds in handling a mobile network.

""I want to see it working for at least one to two quarters and have a roadmap to move at least 30-40% of my customer base by 2025-2026,"" said Mallik Rao, Chief Technology & Information Officer at O2 Telefonica, also known as Telefonica Germany.

The company has 45 million customers in Germany.

AWS and O2 Telefonica did not disclose financial details of the deal.

The core network, which consists of high-performance servers in data centers, is the heart of a mobile network that securely routes data and calls at high speeds. A public cloud will cut costs, increase scale and allow repairs to be done without service disruption.

U.S.-based Dish (DISH.MX), which built its mobile network from scratch, became in 2021 the only telecom company to use AWS cloud for core network.

""Dish was much easier because they had no existing systems that had to be modified to work with the cloud,"" AWS vice president Jan Hofmeyr said in an interview.

Nokia, which also worked with Dish, will provide the software and AWS will provide its infrastructure for Telefonica.

Telefonica first worked with AWS and Ericsson, and then swapped to Nokia and AWS, Rao said. ""The days of trial are over. I don't want to keep on trying.""

The global telecom cloud market is expected to reach $108.7 billion by 2030 from $19.7 billion in 2021, making it a growth driver for companies such as Amazon.

""We want to make it a business to run telco workloads,"" AWS' Hofmeyr said, adding that the company expects more deals with other operators in the next 12 months.

""I would say in most cases the discussion is about timing versus should we move into the cloud.""

>A landmark antitrust case pitting Google (GOOG, GOOGL) against the Justice Department entered its final stage this past week as prosecutors from the federal government and 14 states said in their closing arguments that Google illegally monopolized the online search and search advertising markets.

>A government win would certainly threaten a giant piece of Google’s $237.8 billion profit engine. But the outcome, which will be decided by US District Judge Amit Mehta in the weeks or months to come, also has giant implications for some of the other big names in the tech world.

>That's because Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) are defending themselves against a series of other federal- and state-led antitrust suits, some of which make similar claims, and because all three stand to lose or gain depending on the outcome.

>The government argues Google is violating Section 2 of the Sherman Act by blocking competitors from entering three distinct markets: general online search, search advertising, and search text advertising.

>A government win would put at risk the billions of dollars in mutually lucrative contracts between Google and Apple, as well as deals with other device manufacturers and telecom companies.

> The government alleged in its case that Google pays billions of dollars each year to LG, Motorola (MSI), and Samsung; major US wireless carriers such as AT&T (T), T-Mobile (TMUS), and Verizon (VZ); and browser developers such as Mozilla, Opera, and UCWeb.

>Government prosecutors have alleged that Google had been paying Apple an estimated $8 billion to $12 billion per year — a portion of search ad revenue — in exchange for awarding Google Search default placement on Apple devices.

2024-04-23 11:11:39,Amazon,AMZN,Spotify turns a profit as earnings and revenue beat estimstes,"Spotify Technology (SPOT) reported fiscal first quarter earnings on Tuesday that beat expectations on both the top and bottom lines. The audio giant also swung to a profit as it continues to implement its recent ""efficiency"" strategy.

Over the past year, Spotify has committed to multiple rounds of layoffs in addition to price increases and other initiatives to boost top-line growth and improve margins. The company said it will be more intentional about future investments after spending billions on its push into the crowded podcast market.

The audio giant reported operating income of 168 million euros ($179 million), compared with a loss of 156 million euros in the prior-year period. This was below company guidance of 180 million euros as social charges came in higher than expected, ""driven by share price appreciation during the quarter"", according to Spotify.

It also guided to a strong Q2 operating income of 250 million euros, well ahead of Wall Street consensus expectations. Revenue guidance for the second quarter also came in ahead of estimates — 3.8 billion euros versus the 3.76 billion euros that was expected.

On top of more deliberate spending, Spotify will reportedly once again raise prices after hiking the cost of certain subscription plans last summer.

According to Bloomberg, Spotify plans to raise prices by about $1 to $2 a month in five markets, including the UK, Australia, and Pakistan. The changes are expected to come at the end of April, with US prices to rise ""later this year."" The report also said Spotify plans to introduce a cheaper option that does not include audiobooks.

The stock moved more than 9% higher in pre-market trading on Tuesday following the results.

The streaming service reported net income of 197 million euros ($210 million), or earnings of 0.97 euros per share. That was ahead of analyst expectations of earnings of 0.65 euros per share. It also compares with the year-earlier period loss of 225 million euros, or a loss of 1.16 euros a share.

Gross margins came in stronger than expected at 27.6%, beating company guidance of 26.4%. The streamer said it expects margins to tick up to 28.1% in the second quarter, primarily driven by year-over-year improvements in music and podcasting.

Spotify has previously said it expects the metric to come in between 30% and 35% over the long term amid plans to further scale its podcasting and ads business.

Revenue, meanwhile, totaled 3.64 billion euros ($3.88 billion) — 20% higher compared with the first quarter of 2023, and above Wall Street expectations of 3.61 billion euros.

User figures

Total monthly active users (MAUs) came in below company estimates of 618 million to hit 615 million in the quarter — but still a 19% improvement compared with the total in the year-ago period. The streaming service anticipates Q2 MAUs to come in at 631 million.

Premium subscribers met Wall Street expectations of 239 million — a 14% year-over-year jump. Spotify expects that subscriber count to increase to 245 million in the second quarter.

Free cash flow, another key metric for investors, came in at 207 million euros in the quarter compared to 57 million euros in the year-ago period.

The average revenue per user, or ARPU, for Premium subscriptions increased 7% to 4.55 euros (or 5% year over year, excluding foreign exchange headwinds.) ARPU was driven by price increase benefits that were partially offset by discounted plans and lower prices in emerging markets, the company said.

Profit pledge

Overall, analysts have been bullish on Spotify after the audio giant pledged to improve its profitability beginning in 2023 on a gross margin and operating income basis.

Spotify stock has surged more than 100% over the past year and is up 43% year to date.

Spotify spent $1 billion pushing into the podcast market over the past four years with splashy A-list deals and $400 million-plus studio acquisitions.

That spending took a significant bite out of gross margins and weighed heavily on profitability. In response, Spotify committed to several rounds of layoffs — three in 2023 alone.

Spotify CFO Paul Vogel stepped down from his position on March 31. He will be replaced by Christian Luiga, previously at Swedish aerospace and defense company Saab. Luiga will take over in the third quarter, the company said.

In addition to layoffs and price increases, Spotify also changed up its royalty structure, made audiobooks free to paying subscribers, and locked in new deals with popular podcasters like Joe Rogan and Alexandra Cooper of ""Call Her Daddy.""

The new deals come as Spotify further revamps its podcast strategy to focus more on distribution rather than exclusivity.

The audio giant announced that Rogan's podcast, its most popular on the platform, will be available on additional services like Apple Podcasts (AAPL), Amazon Music (AMZN), and YouTube (GOOGL) for the first time in years. Spotify will handle distribution and ad sales as it works to maximize revenue. Rogan will receive a guaranteed minimum rate and cut of the advertising revenue.

Cooper's ""Call Her Daddy"" deal will have a similar structure with the podcast now available on all major audio platforms after more than two years as a Spotify exclusive. The company will maintain the exclusive rights to the podcast's video portion.

2024-03-21 12:52:49,Amazon,AMZN,Amazon (AMZN) DCF Analysis,"***NOTE NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE***

Before I start, I should preface by saying that I understand that AMZN is a good stock in general, my post will not be on why AMZN is good. But beyond that, I'd also like to explore whether or not AMZN is over/undervalued, it is possible to be a good stock but still overvalued. 

# Introduction:

AMZN has built a strong business model, creating a global logistics network to connect consumers to sellers all over the world. This behemoth of a business inadvertently makes AMZN irreplaceable in our day-to-day life, the convenience and speed at which AMZN offers its services is unparalleled by many companies. Because the company takes a long-term view on returns, it chooses to forfeit short-term gains for longer-term returns. On top of its logistics business, AMZN is also involved in cloud computing the next frontier with large growth potential, all these show the forward-thinking acumen its leaders have.

# Investment Thesis:

***Established Logistics Network***  
AMZN’s most compelling competitive advantage is that it has an established global logistics network that no other company can replicate without substantial monetary and time investment, through controlling its own logistics network by purchasing its own cargo ships and leasing planes ([SOURCE](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/04/how-amazon-beats-supply-chain-chaos-with-ships-and-long-haul-planes.html)). AMZN can control where the ship docks which allows them to be more efficient with their cost through avoiding busy ports.   
  
***Strong Reverse Logistics***  
Consumers increasingly perceive easy & free returns as essential ([SOURCE](https://www.powerreviews.com/research/reduce-returns/)). A very large C.A. for AMZN is its established reverse logistics as evidenced by AMZN being able to offer free return shipping for such a large volume of goods due to them expanding the scale of their reverse logistics that it makes economical sense for them to be able to offer these services for free. AMZN has also increased the ease of returning products, for example, by using UPS stores as a physical retail location where customers can drop off their parcels. UPS is reliant on AMZN as well, accounting for 11% of UPS revenue which gives AMZN large leverage over UPS ([SOURCE](https://www.wsj.com/business/fedex-amazon-discuss-returns-4325af30?st=oo1tomj716vco8d&reflink=article_copyURL_share))  
  
How retailers manage their reverse logistics is also important as it is an additional outlet of significant revenue source. A few notable strides that AMZN is taking in this front is FBA Grade and Sell, where AMZN grades the item that buyers returned and grades it. Afterward, 3P Sellers (FBA Sellers) set the price based on the condition of the product.   
  
***Branding Goodwill***  
Even though in recent years a few large e-commerce platforms have appeared such as Taobao, Shoppee, and Alibaba. AMZN has managed to maintain its reputation as a place that consumers will turn to if they want to get high-quality, safe, and reliable products that would not be flimsy or poorly made. The main reason why people use Taobao or Alibaba is because it is a website to get quasi items at a fraction of the price ([SOURCE](https://ec4ulimited.com/advantages-disadvantages-taobao-shopping/#:~:text=Goods%20from%20Taobao%20are%20cheap,for%20same%20or%20similar%20items)). Consumers have grown to accept the compromise in quality in exchange for a discount, this may be great in an economic downturn but during an average or booming macro environment, it ends up becoming a disadvantage. On top of that, by competing on price Taobao and Alibaba in the long run is unable to earn much margins and reinvest substantially to grow their business at a pace comparable to AMZN.

# Revenue:

***Retail Sales***  
Retail sales refer to AMZN’s online marketplace and physical stores.   
AMZN has such large economies of scale that they can offer higher quality products for cheaper. “Amazon prices are 13% cheaper than other retailers for essential items.” ([SOURCE](https://www.grocerygazette.co.uk/2022/11/16/amazon-prices-cheaper-retailer/#:~:text=Amazon%20prices%2013%25%20cheaper%20than%20other%20retailers%20for%20essential%20items,-FMCGNewsSupermarkets&text=Amazon%20prices%20are%20an%20average,a%20new%20study%20has%20revealed)). On top of that, the increasing convenience of AMZN through speedier delivery increases the appeal of AMZN. “more than 90 percent of consumers expect two- to three-day delivery as the norm, while 30 percent expect same-day delivery.” ([SOURCE](https://www.jpmorgan.com/solutions/treasury-payments/insights/why-shopping-has-changed-forever)).   
AMZN can achieve higher rates of same-day delivery due to their strategy called “regionalization”, where they store items closer to customers. This results in customers choosing AMZN to deliver their everyday shopping needs as AMZN can get them their items significantly faster. Regionalization also allows AMZN to save on cost which in turn allows AMZN to offer a wider variety of items at a lower Average Selling Price (ASP) profitably. On top of that, AMZN has also released RUFUS an interactive AI model that allows the user to chat with it to get more personalized recommendations based on the consumer's diverse requirements.

  
AMZN's next frontier of growth comes from India, where it is building out a logistics network to be able to serve rural customers in India. However, AMZN has recently invested heavily in its fulfillment network by doubling it. ([SOURCE](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-doubled-fulfillment-network-since-202622130.html)) So, I assumed that AMZN would slow down growth plans to capitalize on their new fulfillment network fully. India represents a very strong growth opportunity given the high smartphone penetration rate of India, the rapid growth of the Indian economy, and their large population ([SOURCE](https://www.statista.com/statistics/467163/forecast-of-smartphone-users-in-india/)), this culmination of factors makes India a very lucrative market for AMZN to expand in.  
When forecasting Average Monthly Traffic, I took into account ([SOURCE](https://www.sellzone.com/the-state-of-amazon-2022-key-data-insights-trends-to-watch/)). I assumed that as AMZN’s fulfillment network gets more comprehensive their monthly traffic increases as AMZN’s value proposition increases. I assumed that AMZN expands its fulfillment network significantly every 5 years.  
When forecasting Sales/Monthly Traffic, as AMZN begins targeting more price-conscious countries, I assumed that AMZN’s sales/monthly traffic did not grow due to AMZN raising prices and only grew in line with the perpetual inflation rate. However, in the longer run as AMZN becomes more entrenched in these countries’ consumer habits I assumed that AMZN has larger price-setting abilities.   


***Third Party Sales (3P)***  
Third Party Sales (3P) refers to the %sales AMZN earns as commission from third party sellers that sell on AMZN’s website.   
  
The appeal of AMZN to retailers is that retailers can reach a massive audience very easily and can glean valuable insights on their products from the tools that AMZN platforms provide. Listing on AMZN also adds a layer of credibility and convenience, especially for Fulfillment By Amazon (FBA) sellers.  
  
When forecasting 3P Gross Merchandise Value, I took into account ([SOURCE](https://www.marketplacepulse.com/articles/amazon-sales-top-700-billion-in-2023)). Opting for less granularity I forecasted GMV as a % of historic averages. As AMZN expands into more markets I expect this GMV to increase as there are now more sellers that are attracted to the services provided by AMZN.  
  
When forecasting %GMV Earned, I assumed that AMZN slowly begin taking up a larger portion of the pie as AMZN would build a very strong value proposition to sellers and sellers would grow increasingly reliant on AMZN’s platform. However, I assumed modest growth as AMZN has to remain attractive to sellers by not cutting too much into their margins.

  
***Advertising***  
Advertising refers to ad revenue AMZN earns from advertisers to advertise on AMZN’s platform.  
When forecasting Advertising, there is a lack of suitable data to forecast advertising, and the success of advertising hinges on the success of retail. Opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of retail revenue.  
***Subscription***   
Subscription refers to AMZN’s subscription service, Amazon Prime.  
When forecasting number of subscribers, taking into account ([SOURCE](https://www.yaguara.co/amazon-prime-statistics/#:~:text=There%20are%20230%20million%20Amazon,through%20Prime%20membership%20in%202023)). I believe that NFLX is a very strong competitor having dedicated their entire business model exclusively to content acquisition and marketing compared to AMZN which has a lot of other businesses that they need to pay attention to. I believe a significant portion of subscribers are purchasing Prime Video as an add-on to Amazon Prime rather than just for Prime Video alone. On top of that, in foreign countries where local broadcasters are still in a strong position, it’s tougher for AMZN to break into so I believe that Amazon Prime subscribers will not grow at an aggressive pace. In the past few years, with the backdrop of a poor macro-environment AMZN’s subscribers numbers Y/Y growth rate declined evident that Amazon Prime is perceived as a luxury good or an item placed in low priority.  
When forecasting churn rate, taking into account ([SOURCE](https://churnkey.co/blog/churn-rates-for-streaming-services/)). Opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic averages. However, I believe that AMZN’s churn rate is higher than it should be due to the influx of new subscribers trying out Amazon Prime for the first time. So, over time I believe that as consumers get used to using Amazon Prime and develop a reliance on the service I believe that the churn rate tends downwards. So I assumed that as AMZN enters into newer markets the value of Amazon Prime increases which incentivizes consumers to stay subscribed to Amazon Prime.   
When forecasting Annual Revenue/Member, as AMZN begins targeting more price-conscious countries, I assumed that AMZN’s Annual Revenue/Member did not grow due to AMZN raising prices in these countries and only in countries where AMZN has an established presence. So, this leads to the overall Y/Y growth rate being slower in the short run.

***AWS***  
AWS refers to AMZN’s cloud computing services. AWS offers SAAS and IAAS.  
  
AWS has a strong first movers advantage, they started in 2006 whereas Google Cloud started in 2008 and Microsoft Azure started in 2010. I believe that AWS has had strong growth in recent history in part due to the chip shortage and a mass rush into AI Training that demanded a lot of chips, causing some companies to resort to renting more cloud GPUs from AMZN.  


AMZN’s Gen AI strategy has 3 layers. The first layer is targetting the training and inference market for AI. The second layer (Amazon Bedrock) offers large numbers of foundational LLM that businesses can use and develop according to their needs, allowing customers to experiment with different models to optimize experience and cost. The third layer is (Amazon Q) which functions similarly to ChatGPT.  
  
Others  
AMZN’s other revenue sources.   
  
When forecasting Others, I forecasted it as a %retail sales as the success of Others hinges on the success of AMZN’s retail arm of business. Opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic averages.

# Reality Check:

As a reality check for my forecast, I looked at the world’s GDP to figure out if the GMV for AMZN is in line with the total growth in goods and services in the world. As of 2023, AMZN’s GMV as a %World GDP is 0.5%. By 2040, the world GDP is at 153T ([SOURCE](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Global-GDP-could-rise-by-about-12-trillion-in-2040-an-8-percent-increase-mainly-from_fig1_346806184#:~:text=NonCommercial%204.0%20International-,Global%20GDP%20could%20rise%20by%20about%20%2412%20trillion%20in%202040,health%3A%20A%20prescription%20for%20prosperity)), I assumed that AMZN’s GMV as a %world GDP is 1.8%. This is realistic as over time, it would make sense for smaller players to sell their products on AMZN rather than rebuilding a new logistics network from the ground up. An example of smaller players using a much larger platform to sell is live stream commerce, which is prominent on platforms such as Douyin ([SOURCE](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj8vaCGq4WFAxWO1jgGHaqNBEQQFnoECBMQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.statista.com%2Fstatistics%2F1174906%2Fchina-gmv-of-live-streaming-commerce-on-douyin%2F&usg=AOvVaw1RJ3TKxYD-m8lPZtrTMtRz&opi=89978449)).  
  
The total world population as of 2023 is at 8.05 billion ([SOURCE](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/)), and monthly Traffic as of 2023 as a % of the total world population is at 32.92%. By 2043, the world population will grow to 9.36 billion ([SOURCE](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/world-population-projections/)), I assumed that AMZN’s monthly traffic as a %world population is 49.67%.  
  
I believe that these assessments are realistic given that I am expecting AMZN to expand its logistics network about 6x over 20 years, increasing its reach far beyond its domestic reach in the US. The speed of expansion is logical too given that AMZN was able to double its logistics network 2x over 2 years. 

# Cost:

***COGS***

When forecasting COGS, Regionalization has reduced the distance needed by AMZN to deliver their item to customers, in turn saving cost.   
  
***G&A***

When forecasting G&A, I took into account the number of employees. AMZN has been reducing headcount over the past few years, as AMZN overhired during COVID-19 to keep up with the raging demand.   
  
When forecasting Cost/Employee, as AMZN is in money-saving mode I assumed that they continued the historic trend of cutting down Cost/Employee for the next 2 years before growing in line with the perpetual inflation rate.  
  
***R&D***

When forecasting R&D, R&D was capitalized. To determine the useful life I looked at what the majority of the spending was on, “Software development costs capitalized were not significant for the years presented.” and  “The weighted average remaining life of our capitalized video content is 3.5 years.” - 2023 Q4 10-K. So, I assumed that the main expenditure came from capitalized video content, and applying the conservatism principle, the amortization was rounded down to 3 years.

# Change in NWC:

When forecasting change in NWC as AMZN recently rolled out their regionalization efforts in FY23, the impact on Day Inventory may be very apparent and should be assumed as the status quo going forward.

# D&A and CapEX:

When forecasting Amortization and Content Amortization, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic averages.  
  
When forecasting Content Acquisition and CapEX, I assumed that as AMZN expands its reach the CapEX spending increases before regressing to below historic averages. 

# WACC:

“The weighted-average remaining term of the financing obligations was 17.9 years and 17.0 years and the weighted-average imputed interest rate was 3.1% as of December 31, 2022 and 2023.” - 2023 Q4 10-K   
10Y T-Bond Yield (1M Avg) = 4.31%  
Beta ([SOURCE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN/)) = 1.17  
Stable Market ERP ([SOURCE](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/ctryprem.html)) = 4.60%  
COE = 9.69%  
AMZN is rated “AA-” ([SOURCE](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/fitch-affirms-amazoncom-inc-at-aa-outlook-stable-20-06-2023))  
AA Bond Yield (1M Avg) = 5.03%  
Marginal Tax Rate = 21.00%  
AT-COD = 3.97%  
Stock Price (5D Avg) = $173.97  
Shares O/S = 10387.38M  
Market Value of Equity = 1807092.50M  
Weighted Average Maturity = 17.0 Years  
FY23 Debt Obligation = 67150M  
Interest Expense = 2081.65M  
Market Value of Debt = 60026.19M  
%Debt = 3.21%  
%Equity = 96.79%  
%WACC = 9.48%  


# Conclusion:

Ultimately, in my base case, I value AMZN at $155.67 per share. I believe that AMZN is still overvalued despite it being a good company. This overvaluation of AMZN is a direct result of AMZN posting high free cash flow in recent quarters which gave investors the confidence that AMZN is capable of deriving positive free cash flow from its business. However, most of this positive cash flow was derived from their high margins AWS and advertising increasing substantially Y/Y. This could mean that positive cash flows are a cyclical occurrence as cloud computing is reliant on the volatile AI market and advertising is a cyclical industry that relies on macro-conditions. I believe that there is a strong case for AMZN to break beyond its current market valuation, but for it to be successful will be dependent on how the Indian market reacts to it and if AMZN is able to restart its push in the China market.

2024-03-05 13:00:28,Amazon,AMZN,AI Madness and profitablity,"This isn't a post about AI bubble or why the chip and cloud hardware supplier is on a nutty uptrend. Their revenue in cases like NVDA has grew 120%+ YoY with insane profit margin, and since market is short sighted, it makes sense why the insane run. Lot of people kicking themselves for not see this coming, or someone like me who saw it coming but exited earlier because couldn’t value the “shovel” correctly in this gold rush.   
Now lets take a step back and look at this trend from a different angle. Main buyers are the big 5 Google, OpenAI, META, AAPL, AMZN, MSFT (GOMAM).  
In order for your you all to understand my next points we all first have to agree on few basic things  
**1). Companies have FINITE capex amount**  
**2). Every company at the end of the day WANTS to make money**  
**3). Every company wants to find a way to REDUCE their capex and still grow**  
For point #2, the way these company will eventually make money is by selling the products to consumer and business. So in next 5-10 years we will see leap in software and services innovations. We will see so many new small and midsize companies using these applications to build more complex solutions on cloud. Now take your guess who will benefit the most from this? if your answer is GOMAM, thats correct. If your answer is NVDA then you are an idiot.   
I would say point #1 and point #3 go hand in hand, we are seeing lot of capex diverted within the company itself. So to no surprise, GOMAM are already building and some have built their own silicon. Its just matter of time when they start to reduce their exposure to external company. This isn’t to say that NVDA will ever become irrelevant. The point is they will always have to outgrow and justify for GOMAM to spend their capex on them. This is the bet you are making for going LONG nvidia at these valuation. Because again, market is short sighted, they are seeing 6-12 month guidance and pumping.  
Now i am seeing crazy amount of doom and gloom for companies like AAPL and GOOG lately on reddit and also on media. I just have one question, that goes to #2. How do you guys think every software and services that will leverage these new silicon will reach the end users? Think for a second form a consumer standpoint. They don’t know wtf is NVDA, AMD. All they know is smartphones, tablets, wearable, laptops. I am not saying where you should invest your money. I am just saying don’t go with the trend like a madman. if you miss the shovel rush, you can still make plenty of money on factories that will make gold products for end users.   
**in summary,**   
**I see there is more value in going long on GOMAAM (Added AAPL) than NVDA,AMD**",96,78,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b74mw7/ai_madness_and_profitablity/

2024-03-03 23:39:24,Amazon,AMZN,"I think this year and beyond, Amazon $AMZN will have record cash flow and record stock price, and here is why","Background: I am a 3rd party seller who sells private label goods on Amazon. I gross annually between $1-2mil in revenue. At first many sellers and I kind of brushed off this new policy change that was initiated on March 1st, 2024. However once digging deeper into it and making shipments to send into Amazon, I realized how much of a vulture Amazon truly is. As much as I absolutely hate these changes, and I hope FTC investigates the shit out of them, this is extremely bullish for Amazon's cashflow perspective.  
  
https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/headlines.html?id=GF5ST3HMAHRNW2K5&ref=nslp\_at\_33\_GF5ST3HMAHRNW2K5\_en-US\_ttl\_rf\_recent\_news\_34https://www.ecomcrew.com/amazon-fba-big-fee-increase-2024/  
  
Analysis:  
  
Amazon's recent strategic adjustments are poised to enhance its profitability significantly through the expansion of the Amazon Global Logistics Program and modifications to its Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) policies. Here's a breakdown of why these changes will benefit Amazon financially:  
  
Expansion of Amazon Global Logistics Program:- What it is: Amazon Global Logistics is a comprehensive shipping and logistics service that facilitates international shipping for sellers on Amazon's platform. It handles cargo from the point of origin to Amazon warehouses worldwide, including sea, air, and land transportation.  
  
\- Impact: Given that 60-70% of Amazon's third-party sellers are from China, and a substantial portion of private label goods on Amazon are imported from China, the expansion of this program positions Amazon as a key logistics provider for international sellers. By handling sea shipping directly, Amazon eliminates the need to pay third-party shipping companies, thus capturing more revenue from the logistics and shipping process.  
  
""Voluntary"" Use of Amazon Warehouse Distribution (AWD) for FBA Sellers:

\- What it is: Amazon's policy now encourages third-party FBA sellers to use its Amazon Warehouse Distribution system, compelling them to store inventory in Amazon's warehouses, which incurs storage fees, inbound fees, and other charges. Amazon will then automatically distribute its inventory to FBA warehouses as it deem fit.  
  
\- Impact: This move ensures a consistent revenue stream from storage and handling fees paid by sellers. Additionally, sellers are faced with significant penalties for not using AWD, such as high inventory placement fees or the logistical burden of distributing inventory across multiple locations in the USA. (Before this, sellers can usually send all its inventory to one warehouse to save on cost, but that's no longer the case). This strategy not only generates more revenue from fees but also reduces Amazon's costs by shifting the inventory distribution burden to sellers. The average inventory placement cost per box will be about $25-$50. This is absolutely ridiculous.  
  
Implementation of Extra Fulfillment Fees for Low Inventory:  
  
\- What it is: Amazon has introduced an additional fulfillment fee for sellers who maintain less than 28 days of inventory in Amazon's warehouses. This fee, a minimum of $0.89 per unit, penalizes sellers for not keeping a sufficient stock, especially for high-demand items.  
  
\- Impact: This policy directly impacts sellers' profit margins, especially for those selling products at lower price points. For example, a $9.99 item with a profit margin of $2, selling 10,000 units a month, this extra charge significantly eats into profits. The intent behind keeping inventory levels lean—to avoid excessive storage fees—now results in additional costs through fulfillment fees.  
  
This policy effectively forces sellers to either risk running low on inventory and incurring extra fees or overstock to avoid these penalties, leading to higher storage fees. What's even more fucked up about it is that Amazon fulfillment centers usually checks in our shipments late. This means that if I have shipment that was delivered to Amazon Warehouse (Say enough inventory to cover 40 days) but not checked in, and I only have 30 days of inventory left, now I will have to pay extra fee because of ""low inventory"" even though it takes forever for Amazon to process your inventory. I have multiple shipments that's been delivered for about 3 weeks now, and they are still not checked in.  
  
\- Strategic Benefit for Amazon: By charging extra for fulfillment when inventory levels fall below a certain threshold, Amazon not only generates additional revenue but also pressures sellers to maintain higher inventory levels, thereby increasing the use of Amazon's storage facilities. This policy, combined with the ""voluntary"" use of Amazon's Inventory Placement service for restocking, which incurs additional fees, further ties sellers into Amazon's logistics ecosystem. It incentivizes the use of Amazon's AWD system, underlining Amazon's strategy to centralize control over logistics and distribution, enhancing its revenue streams from logistical and warehousing services while also potentially reducing operational complexities and costs.  
  
\*\*Overall Financial Impact:\*\*These backend changes significantly reduce operational costs for Amazon by streamlining logistics and warehouse operations. Simultaneously, they increase revenue through logistics services, storage, and handling fees. By centralizing control over logistics and storage, Amazon not only saves on the costs of dealing with external logistics providers but also capitalizes on the fees charged to sellers. This dual approach of cutting costs and boosting revenue streams is poised to enhance Amazon's profitability in the competitive e-commerce and logistics sectors.  
  
Again, I hope Lina Khan investigates the shit out of Amazon for using this bullshit tactic, but it is what it is. This is going to be extremely bullish for Amazon as it cuts costs while strengthen its global logistics empire.  
  
Bonus: Amazon Advertising is also a bunch of bullshit (In terms of as a gigantic cash cow for them). The suggested bids for keywords are usually 2x higher than the actual bid needed to get top spots. This makes uninformed sellers spend a crap on advertising everyday. Just for perspective, I have about 12 products in my private label brand, and I spend on average $300-$500 a day. YES EVERY SINGLE DAY. That's about $110k to $190k a year just in ads. This is extremely high margin business for Amazon because they don't have to do anything. In addition, by Amazon running Ads on most prime video accounts, they will make on average $10/month per user. They also signed deals with NFL to exclusively stream their games. As much as I hate them, the future for Amazon is only up.  
  
Extra bonus: Amazon already handles majority of packages in the US. By a click of a button, they can easily start taking marketshare from both UPS and Fedex by offering shipping to everyday people. They can utilize their wholefoods or kohl's location to receive and ship packages. Or they could also offer franchise opportunities to mom-pop shipping/packaging stores just like how UPS and Fedex has it.

I got into IRBT because it seemed that if Microsoft was allowed to acquire Activision, AMZN should be able to acquire a vacuume company, no issue, right? Right? 

It seemed like the risk to reward was there but I think the moral of the story is: don’t buy garbage companies and expect them to fly up. I have played various other merger plays with good success but this one went against my idea of buying decent companies. **Without the merger, IRBT is still overvalued at current prices.**

If you are still in this, the risks of blockage are higher than I expected because AMZN isn’t willing to play ball. Also, considering AMZN dropped the acquisition price previously, it is possible they will drop it again due to the massive drop in price recently. Good luck to anyone who is still playing this. 

All and all, lost a good chunk of money, sold, and I’ve learned my lesson: **if you aren’t willing to hold the underlying, don’t buy it just solely for the merger.**",176,138,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/19aldt3/amzns_irbt_acquisition_blocked/

2024-01-02 22:45:10,Amazon,AMZN,Deciding REITS for my portfolio. But lack the confidence in knowing how to valuate each choice.,"Obviously I want the best to profit the most and don't want to waste time trying learn through experience unless I have the tools to do it efficiently.

I am trying to be a combination of investing types or styles. First is Core and Satellite Investing,  GARP Investing, and Passive Aggressive Investing.

My Portfolio so far is QQQM, AMZN, AAPL, and GLD.

The list of REITS I am trying to decide on adding to the portfolio is this

They all provide monthly dividends because of my preference.

* Realty Income Corporation (O) (I know O is popular choice with its consistent growing dividends)
* Stag Industrial, Inc. (STAG)
* EPR Properties (EPR)
* LTC Properties, Inc. (LTC)
* Global Net Lease, Inc. (GNL)
* Gladstone Commercial Corporation (GOOD)

I have some google sheets made by someone online that I bought for cheap to find good stocks by different stock model valuations. But the person has a reit valuation model and a stock valuation model.

This makes me uncertain since I would want it to be O but I don't want to be bias because of the hype of a single stock.

From my REIT model GNL and GOOD are considered a buy. while the rest at the moment are considered a sell.

But compared to stock valuation O, STAG, EPR, and LTC are considered a buy

This leaves me uncertain is GNL and GOOD considered undervalued? or are both valuation models ineffective?

Then I try using finviz screener and STAG is the only one to show some good fundamentals.

What am I supposed to be looking at fundamentally?

Is there a difference for fundamentals for a reit versus a common stock?

I understand fundamentals as far as personal experience and having a major in finance. But I am seeking reassurance as for what values , ratios, and other data. I should be looking at to find profitable opportunities to buy.

&#x200B;

This is what I have been told to pay attention to or learned online.  All of these fundamentals are from FINVIZ because that is my main stock screener.

P/E , PEG, P/S, P/B, Price/ cash, Price/FCFF, eps growth past 5 years, dividend yield, debt to equity, and operating margin.

I am seeking reassurance or help for me to understand this better. I am honestly just being lazy and just want to make sure I am learning the correct or important stuff. 

&#x200B;

edit: I learned a little bit of fundamentals but not much. It is just smarter to go towards the benchmark since a stock would not be capable of consistently beating the benchmark.  so this helped narrow down my choices with  new ones

2024-01-01 19:00:52,Amazon,AMZN,5 Traits of Companies that have Outperformed,"1. Lower Debt Levels

The world is uncertain and when things go against you, debt magnifies the negative. Of course it can magnify good things as well, but the data reviewed suggests that the best performers get their without high levels of debt.

2. Higher Growth on a Per Share Basis

In things like sales, operating cash flow and free cash flows. The per share component is critical because growth at all costs (especially diluting shareholders) hurts performance

3. Higher Gross Margins

High gross margins suggest that the company can create something of significant value in excess of competition. For a product company, the inputs to make say a cell phone are all more or less the same, being able to sell far in excess of those same ingredients is an indication of pricing power.

4. Operate in a Capital Efficient Manner

This helps to ensure low dilution and low debt hold over time. To model this I used Gross Profits / Operating Assets. Operating assets are defined as Total Assets - market investments. 

5. Sell at a reasonable Price

Even if you meet the criteria of the other 4 to a high degree, the company is not worth an infinite price. I ranked companies by their Gross Profits / Market Cap.


I then plugged this information into Portfolio123. This is back testing software that makes adjustments for when financial data was released (in other words no look ahead bias). I then ranked companies that are part of the Russell 1000 into 10 groups. Higher ranked companies meet more of the criteria mentioned and lesser ranked companies do not meet the conditions mentioned.

The results: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10UJ3-oVJVzDbh4Xclsfdrs9fbPk-TvM6u1nrK6dBxF4/edit

Other Notes: All data above looks at past financial data that would have been available at the time.

Why the focus on Gross vs Net Profits? As mentioned, in my view Gross profits may indicate pricing power. Also when dealing with financials in bulk as you move down the income statement the data can get more noisy. For example in the last few years, gains and losses are required to -ass through the income statement even though it doesn’t make economic sense (you can look up the values of these securities on the balance sheet). Also I realized companies make trade offs farther down the income statement that are neither good nor bad but could be screened out if we only looked at operating or net profits. For example for 2 decades AMZN and CRM purposefully invested aggressively and never showed gains in profits despite a torrid growth pace. This was ultimately wise as they gobbled up more market share. Only recently (particularly for CRM) have profits started as revenue growth has slowed and les investment is needed.

2023-12-31 13:00:46,Amazon,AMZN,Portfolio setup,"Backstory. I’m currently invested in about 20 stocks of about 5% each.

I’m in my early 40s so a minimum’s of 15 years to expected retirement age. 
What I’m considering is selling out of all of these positions and narrow this to 10 holdings at 10% each. The 10 I’m considering are not what I would consider value but great companies. Examples would be: MSFT, V, COST, UNH, APPL, NVDA, AMZN, WMT, MCD, and O.

2023-12-04 00:36:00,Amazon,AMZN,What are the fundamental traits of promising companies?,"I am looking to build a screener that looks at some universal truths of promising companies. Something that when higher/lower it is basically always good. In this post I will argue for the inclusion of some traits and the avoidance of some common ones. Please see below:

What makes a promising company?

*Sales, Operating Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow Growth*: if you ain’t growing your dieing.

*High Gross Margins*: indication of significant value add

*Low Debt and Interest Coverage*: this is where risk of a company is. The lower the better, particularly if they are doing well in all the other factors.

*Low Shareholder Dilution*: like debt, if they are doing the other things well but give the company away, that’s no good.

Characteristics I’d argue against:

*Net Income margin, Operating Income Margin, ROE*: as you get farther down the income statement, more and more can be played with by management. Take AMZN for example. Look at this [chart](https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-revenue-vs-profit-2016-1). AMZN had torrid growth and never grew earnings. Why did the stock go up even though it was and still kinda is a non-profit? They were reinvesting aggressively to fuel that growth ultimately growing their future cash flows more than they otherwise would have been if they showed a profit. Also by not having profits, you minimize taxes. AMZN isn’t the only one to do this, Salesforce did the same [thing](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/1/19/saupload_b70533bae99138dbebd44adae05789c8.png).

It’s not that I think NI, OI and ROE are bad, I am looking for promising companies that are before their maturity.

With ROE, that tells you where a company is, not where it’s going. Take Colgate, they have an ROE of 500%! Do we think that each incremental investment they make will yield a 500% ROE? of course not. They have been able to replace equity with debt to make the “E” smaller jacking up the ROE.

NI Margin is getting more manipulated with GAAP changes. For example, pass through gain and losses on security investments flow through the income statement. Berkshire is a classic case here.

OI Margin: As mentioned above, companies can purposefully spend more to boost growth and if you have say 60, 70, 80% gross margins, that seems like a great idea. This will mean no profits today, faster growth today, and hopefully a greater ability to harvest profits later.

*What do you think, are there any other universal truths of promising companies?*

2023-12-03 02:36:29,Amazon,AMZN,Thoughts on this Strategy: Zombie-Free Indexing,"We all know indexing has many advantages. If you aren’t aware simply google them. One of the main drawbacks is you tend to get the good the bad and the ugly. It drives me nuts knowing my index funds hold/held zombie companies like JCPenny, Macy’s, GM, airlines, etc when many of these businesses are obviously not good or have tough futures. They exist, but they ain’t thriving or haven’t thrived in years.

So I thought, what if i had a basic way to screen out the zombie companies. For me there are a few elements of all businesses that are basically universally good:

Sales are growing, shareholders aren’t diluted, debt is low, there are healthy gross margins and valuation is reasonable. I use these elements are to develop a ranking system. That’s it. They can have no or plenty of operating profit, net profit, ROEs, and so on.

Many factor based strategies look for the metrics included above but I feel that is not a great idea. In my view, there are just too many counter examples to focus on “factors” to make them reliable (AMZN, TSLA, CRM, NOW, etc). Hell a dividend can be interpreted as a sign the company doesn’t have good investment opportunities. And no operating profits (in the case of AMZN/CRM) were the results of aggressive investments in dominating businesses.

I took this theory and ran it in portfolio123 which has controls for backtesting biases and anecdotally looked into a few companies:

A company like Macy’s never qualified in the past 20 years.

NVDA first made the cut in 2015 when it was at $5 or $6 (split adjusted)

Kohl’s never made the cut.

Disney would have made it and been kicked out, PayPal still showing great fundamentals despite it’s getting obliterated.

I'd love to hear your thoughts and engage in a discussion about this investment strategy. Do you think focusing on the metrics above would lead to a better portfolio in the real world?

2023-11-26 14:06:01,Amazon,AMZN,AI is going to kill the Tech Industry,"It’s a story old as time. A new technology hits the world, people want to be part of the new revolution and be the best with the new shiny object. 

Eventually there are too many companies supplying the product and demand focuses on a handful of companies leading to a large fallout in companies values.

Railroad boom and western expansion

First Auto boom

Tech bubble in 2000s

Crypto 

And now it’s in the name of AI.

The power and potential of AI is as beautiful as it is terrifying. Just look at some of these use cases:

[Build tailored “Apps” on Chat GPT](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2023/11/11/openai-will-let-users-build-custom-versions-of-chatgpt.html)

Bill Gates on development of “Agents”:

[In the next five years, this will change completely. You won’t have to use different apps for different tasks. You’ll simply tell your device, in everyday language, what you want to do. And depending on how much information you choose to share with it, the software will be able to respond personally because it will have a rich understanding of your life.](https://www.gatesnotes.com/AI-agents)

While not fully developed yet, as the technology evolves it has the promise to be able to develop whatever you want and connect to whatever you have. If you’re a shareholder of many tech companies this should scare the shit out of you as sea changes lead to the potential for higher churn.

That company you own because there are millions of subscribers that has tailored versions of its product for many industries is about to look pretty antiquated. Have the AI study all the notes in your business and make a tailored CRM with all the best practices for efficient data entry and connect it with my Email. 

Ohh remake my email to be more simple and add tools to make me better at sales. Having difficulty making that tool? No problem go to the AI App Store and subscribe to the best email add-in for sales.

As technology has evolved we have seen basically winner take most markets. Do you really want the 4th ranked GPS on your phone? How about the 3rd best Language Model?

Many companies are creating and launching Language Models right now but as they expand I would assume only a few true leaders will emerge. Will niches develop? Maybe, but remember you can also just upload data to the mainstream ones to give it expertise in what you want quick and efficient knowledge on.

I’d be worried about any tech companies that are “features of AI” not “platforms of AI tools.” A feature would be “we have the best mousetrap” a platform is “we have the best tools to create your mousetrap” and/or “choose from the highest reviewed mousetraps on our AI store”

Even if you disagree with me on the future of tech, we probably agree that the ability to produce new features and products is now extremely fast for large companies and basic tech start ups given output of these models. This means that the supply of code should increase over time which means more tech companies and competition. This is not good for growth and pricing as more hands try to grab their piece of the admittedly growing market pie.

The AI platforms leaders as I see it are: OpenAI, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, ADBE

Potential Platforms:
Salesforce (CRM) with their EinsteinAI application and App Store 

IBM with their AI tools through Watson 

Probably some others

Now I know this is a ""stocks"" subreddit but just like the majority of retail investors, a large chunk of my portfolio is alocated to an S&P 500 ETF.

So I am actually considering instead of DCAing into a broad index ETF, why don't I just DCA into those 7? Maybe even swap META & TSLA since I am not rly a big fan of, with other 2-3 large caps that I favor, like AMD, and ADBE.

Should we expect these 7 to continue outperforming the rest of the world? Should we consider cyclicality? There's no doubt that all 7 of these companies are leaders and are probably not going anywhere in the near future. Nowdays it's as difficult as ever to overtake these giants, imo.",519,331,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/17wju7x/magnificent_7_vs_sp_500/
2023-11-08 11:35:51,Amazon,AMZN,Microsoft stock hits a record high. Why its next move might be lower,"Microsoft stock reached a new all-time closing high—but there could be some hiccups ahead in the short term.  
  
Microsoft's stock rose 1.1% to $360.53 on Tuesday. That's a new closing high, topping the previous high of $359.49 set on July 18. Furthermore, Microsoft has won for eight days in a row, its longest winning streak since January 28, 2021.  
  
The stock has been helped by the company’s strong earnings and sales, which got a boost from the Azure cloud business.  
  
But it’s not just earnings. Microsoft was already outperforming its peers following tech weakness in August and September. Its stock has gained 15% since the end of September, outpacing Amazon.com (AMZN), which has risen 12%, Meta Platforms (META), which has risen 6.5%, Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL), which is up 6%, Alphabet (GOOGL) which has ticked up 0.3%, and Tesla (TSLA), which has dropped 13%.  
  
So, why be concerned? It all comes down to the 14-day relative strength index from Microsoft. The RSI, or Relative Strength Index, is a measure of a stock's or index's momentum, or lack thereof. The closer it comes to 20 on the negative, the more oversold it is, while a score close to 80 indicates that the stock is extremely overbought. A value below 30 usually indicates that a stock is about to rally, while a score above 60 indicates a likely decline. Microsoft's RSI is at 72.75, indicating that it is becoming quite overbought and that a pullback is possible.  
  
That doesn’t mean Microsoft isn’t worth buying for its long-term potential. The company has a lot to recommend, including a cloud business that should get a boost as ChatGPT, which held its developer conference yesterday, looks to expand. It just means that investors might get a better opportunity to pick up shares in the days ahead.

I decided to post here because I'm anxious, scared, and excited at the same time because I finally saved up some money and invested it for the first time.  I quit drinking beer and buying useless crap, and saved up (don't laugh) $1,000 dollars and had it sitting there in a credit union with pennies for interest and I didn't like that.  

I'm really kicking myself for not doing this when I was younger.  I remember when I was in my mid 20's ""this close"" to making a brokerage account and getting started, and I never did it.  Did this scare any of you the first time you got in to trading?  

The first share I bought was 1 full share in the Vanguard VGT ETF.  I know it sounds dumb, but it was pretty scary and exciting at the same time.  My position is focusing 80% ETFs and sprinkle in some individual stocks to play around with.  

My primary goal is dividends and compound reinvesting, in the hopes that I can have a nice-ish passive income 20-30 years from now.  I'm wondering what you guys think of my current positions:

**ETFs:** VGT, VONG, VTI, SCHD, and SCHG

**Stocks** *(I bought fractions of these)*:  AAPL, AMZN, HD, JNJ, KO, MSFT, NVDA, O, RTX, WM, WMT

That was my attempt of diversifying.  I have been reading until my eyes bleed, and I really have no idea if what I'm doing is considered smart or not.  But for the first time, checking my portfolio today.. seeing I'm up 1.24% with everything in green (short of stupid Wal\*Mart)...  

I'm up a whopping $10!  And I think that's pretty cool!!!  Now how in the hell do I make that **bajillions**?

TGT \[Target\] = Target has its problems such as organized theft like most chain stores do. Target also has its base of customers that want to shop there and nowhere else. Looking the last 10 years over it usually performs well between September and January, about 70% of the time (some of its best runs came from fall - late winter). 

W \[Wayfair\] = Wayfair has its base of customers that are loyal to it. Although it had a boom and bust cycle from 2020 until now due to COVID restrictions going from being a thing to not anymore - I see this stock as a good play for the next 6 months. People are still moving (upper middle class) and finding new jobs, many that require relocation. People who helped pump W to go over 10X in 2020 are the same people who will buy things from them during the holiday season, if they move hundreds of miles away, etc. 

ORCL \[Oralce\] = They are a powerhouse of a company - the small caps cannot compete, and I am unaware of a single company that I've used who has stopped using them to use another product.

2023-09-15 17:50:37,Amazon,AMZN,"A fight between fast-food chains and unions in California is over, for now","https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/15/california-fast-food-minimum-wage-deal-what-to-know.html

* From 2025 through 2029, a nine-person council will have the authority to raise the hourly minimum wage annually for affected businesses.  Workers will get at least CPI.  If higher than 3.5% minimum that amount and council will determine pay.
* The California minimum wage for fast-food workers is on track to rise to $20 an hour next April.
* The pay hike is part of deal between the restaurant industry and labor groups over controversial legislation in California.
* Tickers mentioned in article CMG, YUM, QSR, MCD, DPZ, AMZN, TGT, WMT

-----------------

Fast-food workers in California are set to receive pay hikes next year after the restaurant industry and unions reached a compromise over a controversial bill.

The deal, brokered with the help of Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office, also creates a nine-person council that will decide on future wage hikes for the fast-food industry in California through 2029. The agreement ends a fight between the two sides that threatened to stretch out for years. The restaurant industry was gearing up to spend more than $100 million on the battle.

The deal will mean a wage floor of $20 for California workers at fast-food chains with at least 60 locations nationwide, starting April 1. And from 2025 through 2029, the appointed council will have the authority to raise the hourly minimum wage annually by whichever is lower: 3.5% or the annual change in the consumer price index.

The council will include four representatives from the fast-food industry, four from the workers’ side and one neutral party who will serve as chair.

While fast-food operators will have to cope with paying higher wages, the agreement thwarts more dire consequences, according to industry analysts.

“I certainly wouldn’t say it’s catastrophic, and certainly not as bad as it could have played out over the next year or two,” said Mark Kalinowski, CEO of Kalinowski Equity Research.

California lawmakers rushed to conclude the matter before the legislative session ends midnight Friday. The state senate passed the bill Thursday, and the state assembly has concurred with the upper house’s amendments. Newsom, a Democrat, has already pledged to sign the bill into law.

**California’s fast-food fight**

Newsom signed AB 257, also known as the FAST Act, into law in January. The legislation would have created a 10-person council that would govern fast-food chains with more than 60 locations, including setting guidelines for working conditions and wages. The initial wage hike could have been as high as $22 an hour.

But the fast-food industry was attacking the bill before it even made its way to Newsom’s desk. State records show that Chipotle Mexican Grill, Chick-fil-A, Yum Brands and Restaurant Brands International were among the chains that spent money to lobby California lawmakers to oppose the legislation.

McDonald’s U.S. President Joe Erlinger wrote a letter posted on the company’s website, making a rare public statement on a political issue. Erlinger called the bill “lopsided” and “ill-considered,” attacking lawmakers for not targeting all restaurants. As of 2022, just under 10% of McDonald’s U.S. restaurants were located in California, according to Citi Research. Most are run by franchisees.

The restaurant industry retaliated, gathering enough signatures to create a referendum that would make California’s voters decide on the matter. The Service Employees International Union, which backed the FAST Act, alleged in a lawsuit that the industry misled signatories, but a judge ruled against the union. The referendum was supposed to be on November 2024 ballots.

In response to the referendum, the SEIU backed another bill, AB 1228. The bill would impose joint-employer liability on franchised businesses — including the very restaurant chains that loudly decried AB 257.

Under the bill, franchisors like McDonald’s would be held liable for infractions committed by their franchisees. Opponents said that the bill attacked the very nature of the franchising model. AB 1228′s provisions were originally included in AB 257 but removed before Newsom signed it into law.

The California State Assembly passed AB 1228 in early June. But the state’s Senate never had the chance to vote on that version.

Instead, the restaurant industry and the unions struck a deal, replacing the joint-employer provisions with the terms of their agreement, which also includes repealing the FAST Act and withdrawing the referendum by Jan. 1.

**What’s next for workers?**

Fast-food workers employed by affected restaurants will see pay increases of as much as 25% hit their paychecks starting in April. The current California minimum wage is $15.50 an hour, with a bump to $16 set for January.

Employees of smaller fast-food joints and other restaurants could also reap some benefits from the legislation.

“When you look at the $20 minimum wage, that’s a bar that’s being set,” Joe Pawlak, managing principal of restaurant consulting firm Technomic, told CNBC. “That’s going to make the restaurant industry a lot more competitive for employees, so other industries are going to have to also step up.”

In recent years, Amazon warehouses and retailers like Walmart and Target have lured workers away with higher hourly pay. Now they’ll be forced to compete with fast-food chains, which have traditionally been slower to raise wages due to operators’ razor-thin margins.

Other states, like Minnesota or New York, could also follow California’s lead and craft similar councils to govern restaurants or other industries, Pawlak said.

″[The deal] puts a model in place with a structure that everybody is able to digest,” he said.

Still, labor’s side had to make some trade-offs to get the deal in California. One key concession is that the council won’t have the power to set working conditions. Instead, the Fast Food Council will only be able to recommend proposed standards to state agencies.

But that doesn’t mean that unions won’t keep trying to push for better conditions.

“Fast-food workers’ fight in California isn’t close to over — it has only just begun as they prepare to take their seat at the table and help transform their industry for the better,” SEIU President Mary Kay Henry said in a statement to CNBC.

**What does it mean for restaurants?**

Faced with a mandate to pay higher wages, fast-food operators will have to decide how they plan to deal with elevated labor costs. Some may raise menu prices, although customers may balk at having to foot the bill. Others may try to make do with fewer workers on hand or to invest in automation to handle more tasks.

But it’s not all gloomy for restaurants.

“This agreement protects local restaurant owners from significant threats that would have made it difficult to continue to operate in California. It provides a more predictable and stable future for restaurants, workers, and consumers,” Sean Kennedy, executive vice president of public affairs at the National Restaurant Association, said in a statement.

The chief uncertainty resolved by the deal is the referendum slated for November 2024 ballots. The industry had already spent more than $64 million on the referendum, according to California records, and was preparing to spend much more. But it would be difficult to predict which side voters would take.

″[The agreement] shows just how concerned the industry was,” Kalinowski said. “The referendum would have been very challenging, to have it come out their way.”

On top of that, restaurant chains like In-N-Out now save some cash that otherwise would have gone toward the industry’s war chest.

The deal also avoids the change to joint-employer liability that was feared by the broader franchising industry.

“This allows the franchise model to exist,” said Dana Kravetz, a Los Angeles-based labor attorney at Michelman & Robinson.

Fast-food companies with heavily franchised footprints, like McDonald’s, KFC, Taco Bell and Domino’s Pizza, will largely escape the effects of the bill, unless they have company-owned locations in California.

Instead, their franchisees will have to grapple with how to pay higher wages. The National Owners Association, an independent advocacy group of McDonald’s franchisees, plans to push back. In a memo viewed by CNBC, the NOA projects the bill will cost each restaurant in the state $250,000 annually.

Restaurant companies that don’t franchise will have to foot the bill for increased labor costs themselves. That includes Chipotle Mexican Grill, which has 457 locations — or 14% of its total footprint — in its home state of California.",57,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/16jk0tb/a_fight_between_fastfood_chains_and_unions_in/

MSFT: \~75%  
AMZN: \~9%

I earned my MSFT shares during my career there and am pretty bullish on their future, hence the big slice of the pie they occupy. I added the TSLA in 2016 and sold a few when it had a big gain but again I'm bullish on them. Most of the stocks have been held for at least 3 years.  
  
So, what are your thoughts?  
  
Should I rebalance these existing stocks?  
Should I consider adding AAPL to diversify a bit within the tech sector?  
Or should I just move it all into QQQ for ease of management?

  
Just seeking opinions.

&#x200B;

If I don't simplify now I will need to in the coming years. I have a couple of years of cash equivalents available and will rebalance annually.

I'm not keen to just put it all in in an S&P tracker or whatever as I believe tech will out perform for the foreseeable future. Also much of the rest of my retirement fund is well diversified in managed funds I can't touch yet due to tax/age.

2023-09-05 00:05:30,Amazon,AMZN,Should I buy different ETFs depending on the type of account? IRA account vs. Individual Investment account.,"My mother recently passed away, and I inherited two Fidelity accounts that she had. One of the accounts was her IRA account. The other was an individual investment account. After taking a look at both of them, I realized that she has a ton of money in bonds.

15% VTI (ETF)- Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund - Overall stock market.

10% AVUV (ETF)- Avantis US Small Cap Value -  US small-cap.

2023-09-04 19:40:02,Amazon,AMZN,Wouldn't it be much more logical to swing trade in Roth IRA's and long-term hold in regular accounts instead of the exact opposite?,"Wait a second before you have a meltdown over this. Hear me out, then tell me that I'm a dumbass.

It's my belief that most people turn into the Boglehead types over time because of their experiences with paying taxes on short-term capital gains and long-term capital gains. Newer investors don't have the experience with dealing with their taxes as much, so they tend to swing for the fences with shorter-term positions.

More seasoned investors tend to buy and hold, but this is a learned behavior because they know that their absolute worst case tax scenario on a long-term gain is 20 percent (federally). Of course, you only pay the 20 percent on long-term cap gains if you're income is over like 492k or something. Most end up paying about 15 percent federal tax on their long-term cap gains. Short-term cap gains seem to be taxed almost double that amount, obviously it depends on your exact tax bracket situation, but you get the point.

Thus, it's been beaten into the heads of seasoned investors that it's just smarter in the long run to hold positions for at least a year, because your tax bill is often cut in half, or almost in half. You do this long enough, and it becomes ingrained in your investing personality.

All of this makes perfect sense to me.

Ok, now let's talk about Roth IRA's. With Roth IRA's, if you're doing things correctly, there's ZERO taxes on your earnings when you're taking your money out. Obviously you need to be 59 1/2 years old and you need to have passed the 5-year rule, etc., etc.

But if ultimately there's no tax implications whatsoever for investments that are under the Roth umbrella, why do most people tend to hold things for the long-term, and be ultraconservative?

**WAIT!**

I already know what you're going to say, but I'm going to argue that it's nonsensical. You're going to say because Roth IRA's are designed for retirement, and when you get up to that age you should be a lot more risk adverse, because you really need this money for your retirement and you can't be screwing around, taking penitentiary chances.

However, here's my argument to that. Consider all of your investments, Roth and normal brokerages as this large bucket of water. Most ~~people~~ investors will have a Roth account and a regular brokerage account. Due the limitations on how much you can get into a Roth each year, it's likely that most people will have at least 5 to 6 times as much money in their regular brokerage accounts as their Roth accounts. For example.... Imagine somebody has 50k grand total in various Roth accounts. Maybe a standard issue Roth and a 401k Roth. But they have 250k in a ""normal"" brokerage account.

In this scenario, less than 17 percent of their overall investment money is in their Roth. So, the argument that they need to be ULTRA CAREFUL WITH THEIR ROTH MONEY is pretty illogical, because it's such a small percentage of their overall scenario.

**Wouldn't it be tremendously more logical to actually trade that 17 percent of their account more aggressively, when it's the only 17 percent that isn't negatively affected by moving in and out of stocks?**

Think about the guy that has Microsoft stock. Been holding MSFT for years. He knows the ups and downs. The peaks and valleys. He can probably tell you countless times he would have taken profits if only there wasn't a major tax consequence. So, he doesn't take profits when the stock gets ahead of itself, and then buy back in during a retracement. But his reasoning is tax implications. Inside a Roth, there's no tax implications. Thus, this same investor could sell out of MSFT when he thinks it's gotten ahead of itself, and then buy back in during a retracement and end up with more overall shares. All with no taxable implications whatsoever.

Now obviously, nobody can predict the future and sometimes people are going to get it wrong. They'll sell MSFT when they think the stock has gotten way ahead of itself and then it continues to go on a tear and now he can't buy back in and still have the same number of shares.

But by the same token, just talk to any Amazon investor over the last three years. That shit has basically gone pretty much nowhere for a three-year period. So the whole buy and hold forever strategy hasn't worked out that great for AMZN holders. 

It cuts both ways. Don't just cherry pick the example of it hurting.",102,189,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/16a1qom/wouldnt_it_be_much_more_logical_to_swing_trade_in/

2023-08-04 20:48:19,Amazon,AMZN,FactSet's Earnings Update with 84% of the the S&P 500 Companies Reporting (about 80% of market cap),"[Here's the usual weekly Factset update](https://insight.factset.com/sp-500-earnings-season-update-august-4-2023).

# Earnings and Revenue YoY Decline

With 84% of the companies in the S&P 500 (and 80% of the market cap roughly) having reported, the new blended earnings estimate is -5.2% YoY--one week ago, their estimate was -7.4%, so we surprised to the upside. The blended revenue estimate is +0.6% YoY. [Blended just means combine estimates of companies that haven't reported with those that have]

# Beating/Missing Earnings

> Of these companies, 79% have reported actual EPS above estimates, which is above the 5-year average of 77% and above the 10-year average of 73%. [...]

> In aggregate, companies are reporting earnings that are 7.2% above estimates, which is below the 5-year average of 8.4% but above the 10-year average of 6.4%.

So 80% are beating (on average 73% do), and they are beating estimates by 7.2% on average (which is typical). Yes, analysts lowered estimates.

# Sectoral Breakdown

The year over year declines in earnings are driven entirely by 3 sectors: Energy, Materials, and Health Care. All other sectors are seeing year over year growth. Similarly, the revenue declines are only in 3 sectors: utilities, energy, materials. Notice health care missing? In fact, the top 3 sectors by revenue growth are consumer discretionary, financials, and health care. My conclusion is that healthcare's earnings decline is driven by steep margin compression. [Patents expiring? Post-Covid operations increasing costs for insurers?] While energy/materials are just seeing revenue tank and thus earnings.

Top 3 earnings sectors are Consumer discretionary, Communication Services, Industrials. Guessing thanks to AMZN, META, GOOG, CAT.

# Valuations

Valuations are basically a little over average but not insane.

> The forward 12-month P/E ratio is 19.2, which is above the 5-year average (18.6) and above the 10-year average (17.4). It is also slightly above the forward P/E ratio of 19.1 recorded at the end of the second quarter (June 30).",22,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/15ibf4d/factsets_earnings_update_with_84_of_the_the_sp/

2023-08-01 02:38:08,Amazon,AMZN,The 2023 stock market rally got a lot healthier in June and July,"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-2023-stock-market-rally-got-a-lot-healthier-in-june-and-july-210139678.html

July has come and gone for investors, bringing with it a continuation and a new twist on the blistering stock market gains seen in the first half of this year.

The Tech sector (XLK), along with some of last year's biggest losers like Communication Services (XLC) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY), powered the market's rally through May.

July has come and gone for investors, bringing with it a continuation and a new twist on the blistering stock market gains seen in the first half of this year.

The Tech sector (XLK), along with some of last year's biggest losers like Communication Services (XLC) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY), powered the market's rally through May.
[Money doesn't grow on trees]

But over the last two months, one of the biggest concerns among market bears — that the rally had become too concentrated — has been addressed with all 11 sectors in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) logging gains between June and July.

And while the aforementioned stars of this year's rally are still playing a leading role, a surge in oil prices has brought Energy (XLE) into the fold with cyclical sectors like Materials (XLB) and Industrials (XLI) also sitting on gains north of 14% since June as optimism about the economy abounds.

This has left all sectors with the exception of Health Care (XLV) and Utilities (XLU) sitting on year-to-date gains through July.

Combine this broad strength with the bullish year-to-date seasonality stats we've been compiling and the final five months of the year have some powerful tailwinds. Notably, however, Tuesday brings us into August, which has been the weakest month of the year over the last 25 years.

[**Broadening of the market.**](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Cj8RJI9cSQHXtbHDpHlEqQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNQ--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/134ad610-2fe2-11ee-bf6f-1ffefac75b64)

In the table above, we can see that the three leading sectors until May were those that house the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks, as well as the growthier names that tend to be less cyclical.

The Tech sector is home to much of the artificial intelligence trade, including Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA). Apple (AAPL), which is up some 50% so far this year, is also a member of the Tech sector.

Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), along with Meta Technologies (META), is a member of the Communication Services sector.

And even with the rally broadening in recent months, we can see Tech is still doing a lot of the heavy lifting. It may not be a surprise, then, to learn that both Apple and Meta have been positive each month this year. (For Meta, the streak of monthly wins extends all the way back to November 2022.)

Through May, Amazon (AMZN) and other e-commerce plays were primarily responsible for boosting gains in the Consumer Discretionary sector.

In the two months since, brick and mortar stalwarts like Kohl's (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN) have joined the rally, with each up over 50% since the end of May.

Cyclical names — whose fortunes vary more alongside the state of the economy — dominate the components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI).

And inside the index we can also see the game of catch-up taking place.

The latest returns from June to July are reflected on the x-axis in the chart below, while prior gains through May are expressed vertically on the y-axis.

Industrial giant Caterpillar (CAT) is alone at the right edge of the chart — up 29% the last two months after sinking 14% earlier this year. Caterpillar will report earnings on Tuesday.

3M (MMM) and Boeing (BA) are also among top recent returns, while rounding out the top five are banking giant JPMorgan (JPM) and retail leader Home Depot (HD).

Also noteworthy are the few laggards that haven't mustered much the entire year and are camping out in the lower left of the chart.

Consumer Staples (XLP) company Walgreens (WBA) happens to be dead last on the year-to-date list, down 20%. Telecom company Verizon (VZ) and pharmaceutical giant Merck (MRK) are also toward the bottom.",32,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/15ezvef/the_2023_stock_market_rally_got_a_lot_healthier/

I never buy stock prior to September 2021. When inflation was high at that time, I decided to dump all my cash into stock market and thought it would hedge inflation.  I paid for a stock pick service and bought all stocks from their recommendations. I bought SHOP at $1500, UPST, SNOW and ZS at $300, CRWD and DOCU at $280, TTD at $100, TSLA at $800, HUBS at $600, ROKU at $120...

Since 11/2021 the Fed started to crash the market. I kept on DCA, but the more money I added the more I lost. **On 12/31/2022, my loss was around 65% at $800,000.** I was unhappy and mentally stressed the whole time and did not think I can recover the loss one day.

On 2023, my portfolio started to turn around. All the holdings I have through 2021-2022 are 2X to 4X from the bottom. **Recently both my realized and unrealized gain/loss are finally positive with a whopping +219% gain TYD**.  I still cannot believe how quickly it turns around. I feel I am extremely fortunate.

I wrote this post just want to share my feelings with all bag holders. When you feel there is no light at the end of tunnel, don't loss hope and keep adding money to good companies when their prices are down. Your loss will recover one day.

**===============================Update on 7/12/2023 =======================**

**1)**  To reply to several comments below about me deserve losing all my money,  uneducated, know nothing and is an idiot kid with rich parents, I acknowledge that my initial investment decision and stock selection was very rash and clueless. But such comments and judgements are really not friendly to someone you don't even know in internet . Instead I grew up in a poor family and I am a first generation immigrant here without any relatives in the states. My parents combined are making $1200/month which is highest ever they make.

&#x200B;

**2)** To answer the question about why I hold these stocks:

**UPST**

Pros: Technology is disruptive. Total addressable market is huge. They had two $300+M revenue quarters with positive net income in 2021 when they only had personal loans. Once interest rate goes down and funding constrain is loosen, with their 2 new products car loan and small loan (as well as future new products), the revenue can be $500M quarterly easily. Stock price should be doubled at least if that happens.

Cons: When funding constrain will be loosened is questionable. CEO has poor vision and is indecisive and not trustworthy.

Comments below questioned my oversized position in UPST. I have large position because I bought it at $300 in 2021, then significantly added shares at $150, $40, $17 and $12 to bring down the average cost. This year my broker paid me 22% interest to borrow all UPST shares from me for short sellers. I was happy to collect the interest thus I did not trim any UPST when price went up from bottom. The interest rate they paid me kept dropping like freefall and reached a lowest point at 5% 2 weeks ago because of less short flow. Last week my broker returned all UPST shares to me because no short sellers borrow it any more. I trimmed my shares by 6% the day before I created this post. I will trim it further if price keeps going up but given it is high potential, it will still be my largest position at 15% to 20% 

&#x200B;

**SOFI**

I started to follow SOFI this year and after their last impressive ER stock price dropped surprisingly so I started my position at $5s. The following day analyst downgraded SOFI because ""personal loans are risky"", I doubled my shares at $4s for a total of $60,000 because I thought the downgrade is nonsense. When price went up from there to $10+, multiple analysts downgraded it again with the same reason and so called good-news-already-priced-in. The price dropped by about 10% one day to below $8 in the morning but recovered all loss in the same day! This shows how resistant the price is so i added shares at $8s. 

Pros: They increased their revenue by 50% YoY without their largest 2 sources of revenue - student loan and mortgage, compared with pre-COVID. With the significant increased number of users in past 3 years, once student loan and mortgage are back like pre Covid, their revenue will be 5X to 10X. It is expected to achieve net income profitability by Q4 2023.  CEO has very good vision (shift focus to personal loans quickly when their main source of income was gone) and is very decisive (when he answered analysts'  doubts about persona loans). CEO heavily loading shares at $4 to $6 boosted my confidence in SOFI.

Cons: Hard to give it a fair multiple because there is no comparable companies. Multiple will be low if it is valued as a bank.

&#x200B;

**IT Sector: ZS, CRWD, BILL, NET, IOT, GLBE**

**ZS, CRWD** are pretty stable and the least expensive growth stocks among IT sector, given similar margins among companies in this sector but different scales, growth rates, P/S multiples and FCF trending. In comparison:

Companies like SNOW grow faster but P/S and employee stock compensation are way much higher (I sold out SNOW at $170s)

Companies like NET, MDB and DDOG grow slower yet their P/S are higher (I sold out DDOG at $90s)

Companies like S and IONQ grow much faster but their scales are much smaller ($500M quarterly revenue at $40% growth is more impressive then $100M quarterly revenue at 70% growth) and have indefinite timeline of achieving profitability.

That is why ZS and CRWD win out overall in this sector.

I own **NET** even though it is on the expensive end among IT growth companies because I work for a cyber security company which competes with NET and our management always speak highly of NET

**IOT** is very expensive but they are also very close to profitability and have a large total addressable market. They are the leader in their industry.  What makes them different from other IT companies and deserve higher valuation is that the more a customer spend with them, the more the customer may save on their operating expense so it’s a win-win, thus existing customers will be willing to spend more voluntarily.

**BILL** is another least expensive growth stock in this sector likewise, though their product is nothing innovative and can be easily replicated.

**GLBE** is getting expensive with recent 1-month straight up run regardless Nasdaq is up or down. But I don't know any other player in the market that offers the same product as GLBE

Also if valuation multiples are similar, I prefer tech companies whose existing customers can spend more with increasing usage/units/endpoints/etc (e.g. ZS, CRWD, IOT, SNOW, MDB, SHOP) over companies that sell software at a flat annual price (such as project management or human resource management software e.g. TEAM, ASAN, MNDY, HUBS - I can be wrong on these 4 companies because I simply looked at their products without checking their ER). Of course companies with higher recurring revenue deserve higher premium.

&#x200B;

**Healthcare Sector: TMDX, HIMS**

**TMDX**: product is a game changer - In the past, when a donor donated a live organ, the organ had to be stored in a freezer and is good for only a few hours, thus donor and donee have to be in the same geographical location. TMDX's device mirrors human physiology to connect to the organ to keep it alive for much longer period of time, which allows the organ to be transported to a different geographical location. 

Their growth rate and valuation are both very high. Their stock price has highest ceiling in next 1-2 years among all my holdings. It’s the only company that I own will not be impacted by possible incoming economic recession.

**HIMS**: unbelievably cheap. Major concern is regulation (though it has never happened so far). Stock price fell after the last ER because analysts criticized their sales and marketing spending which is non issue to me. Their recurring revenue is 90% so the money they spend in sales and marketing is a good investment to me.

Healthcare sector did not have a run like IT sector so far this year. It is probably a good time to add holdings in healthcare sector.

&#x200B;

**MELI**

A stable yet fast growing company dominating south America e-commence market. Their AD revenue and fintech are growing at a very fast pace. Valuation is very reasonable. PE is high but P/FCF is low. Stock analyst Brain Stoffel has best ERs' coverages in Youtube and his analysis in twitter about this company.

**DIS**

I bought it because Disney brought back old CEO in hope of regrowing stock price. The CEO will do whatever to cut cost so I am willing to hold it for 1 to 2 more ERs

**OPEN**

I bought OPEN after their impressive Q1 2022 ER (the only net income positive quarter so far). It trended down from there because of housing market and is finally on an upward trend this year with higher and higher margin month over month. Stock price is 5X this year. Twitter account ""operdoor2"" has OPEN's real time sales and margin data.

&#x200B;

Other holdings I have are big names that everyone know about what they do so I will not dig into them: **TSLA, AMD, ENPH, UNH, AMZN**

&#x200B;

**3)** To answer if I do options, day trade, swing trade and what helped my recover.

I do not do options. I rarely swing trade in 2021-2022 because almost all my holdings were red. I started swing trading several transactions per week this year. This helped me quite a bit to recover my loss.  Just to give a few examples:

I sold $80,000 ZS (and still has $110,000) 2 days ago on Monday (the day before I created this post on Tuesday) when ZS was up 7% on that day to $155 for no news. In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst’s downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on Monday are green.

Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from  $155 just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS.

Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1). I kept adding shares to ZS on its way down especially heavily at $87 and $85 on around 5/1. My total shares of ZS is more than tripled after that. Fast forward to this week, I trimmed 40% of shares at $150s. So when you own 15 growth sticks, you can compare their weekly, monthly and 3-month charts and choose the worst performed stocks to DCA if there is no major company specific bad news. This turns out well for me. 

Yesterday right before I created this post, I sold out my UBER position for profit taking (UBER will be a cash cow BTW so I am looking to add it back when price pulls back) and increased my shares of TSLA and AMD when both of them had 2 red days in a row  this Monday and Tuesday while all my other growth stocks performed very well in these 2 days. To answer one of the comment below about my cost basis of AMD and TSLA being high - It is because in the past one month I sold 2/3 of my AMD and TSLA shares at near recent peak at $130s and $270s respectively for 30% profit taking and added them back when their prices had 5% to 15% pull back.

Whenever there is an analyst downgrade, more often than not, I feel it is because institute buyers want to load up their shares so they hammer the stock price as low as possible prior to buying. If the reason for downgrading is nonsense or minor, or are repeat downgrades using the same reasons,  I add shares. This works very well for me so far. After UPST was down to $40 last year, analysts used same reasons to repeatedly downgraded it for 9 months all the way down to $12, I loaded up shares at $40, $17 and $12. Fast forward to today it’s $44.

Also post ER overreaction is a good time to add shares. I follow ABNB's last 5 ERs and their price always dropped after ER even though every ER was great (The explanation of the drop is that high valuation stocks' ER need significant beat rather than just moderate beat). ABNB stock price awalys recovered in 1-3 weeks after post ER drop. This happens every single time. I sold out $60,000+ ABNB last week with 20%-25% gain when it reached $130s. Same for CRWD last ER, it was perfect but price dropped 10% post ER, I added shares post ER and price recovered to pre ER level in 2 days.  And SOFI last ER too, it recovered the post ER and downgrade price drop to raise from $4s back to $6 within 2-3 weeks (as I mentioned earlier, I opened my position of SOFI for a total of $60,000 at $5s and $4s within 24 hours post ER and downgrade)  

So in short, swing trade and rebalancing  (from short term winner to looser) helped me so far.  Of course it is the microeconomy that drove the recovery primarily, but rebalancing and adding shares after post ER overreaction and nonsense downgrade contribute to probably 20% to 30% of my recovery.",101,107,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14x34yk/started_investing_92021_and_finally_break_even/

But they are undecided about what the central bank will do at its September meeting after last week’s continued robust jobs data raised concern that policymakers will revert to raising rates following the June pause.
*****
> “The pause, agree or disagree, is to gather more information,” Solus Alternative Asset Management’s Dan Greenhaus said Monday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.” He added, “One more hike or two more hikes is much less important than when, ultimately, they begin to cut rates on the other side of this. That’s much more consequential for, I think, the risk landscape than one more hike or two more hikes.”
*****
> On the economic front, June’s NFIB Small Business Index, a measure of business confidence, is set for release Tuesday before the bell. Economists polled by Dow Jones are anticipating a reading of 90.0, slightly higher than the 89.4 level in May.
*****
> Second-quarter earnings season kicks off later this week with results from “systemically important financial institutions” such as JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup, plus BlackRock, PepsiCo and Delta Air. Dow component UnitedHealth reports Friday.

2023-07-10 20:25:37,Amazon,AMZN,"Nasdaq 100 Plans Special Rebalance To Curb Dominance Of 'Magnificent Seven' (apple, meta, google, Microsoft, Tesla..)","From https://www.investors.com/news/nasdaq-100-plans-special-rebalance-to-curb-dominance-of-magnificent-seven/



The Nasdaq 100 index is set to adjust the weighting of its 100 components, with the ""magnificent seven"" stocks Microsoft (MSFT), Apple, Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon.com (AMZN) currently accounting for more than half the index's weight.

The magnificent seven stocks largely fell Monday.

The Nasdaq 100 special rebalance will take place before the market open on Monday, July 24, to ""address overconcentration in the index by redistributing the weights.""

The weighting changes will be announced on Friday, July 14. No stocks will be added or removed.

The Nasdaq 100 includes the 100 largest non-financial Nasdaq components.


How Is the Nasdaq 100 Weighted?
The Nasdaq 100 index is a modified market-capitalization index. Market valuation is the largest factor, but with methodology to limit overconcentration.

The seven-largest companies in the Nasdaq 100 account for 55% of the index. It seems likely that this combined weighting will be reduced. It's also likely that there may be notable weighting shifts within these seven giants.

The current weights show that market capitalization is the dominant factor, but it's not the only one.

Microsoft stock has the largest weight, at 12.9%, as of July 7. Apple stock has a 12.5% weight, despite having a $2.999 trillion market cap vs. Microsoft's $2.51 trillion.

Google stock has a 7.4% weighting with the GOOGL and GOOG share classes combined.

Nvidia stock has vaulted to a 7% Nasdaq 100 weighting, thanks to its $1.05 trillion market cap. That's a slightly larger weight than Amazon stock (6.9%), even though the latter has a significantly higher valuation at $1.33 trillion.

Tesla stock and Meta Platforms round out the top-seven members, with weights of 4.5% and 4.3%, respectively.

Just for reference, for the entire Nasdaq composite, Apple stock had an 11.4% weighting as of July 7 while Microsoft was at 9.5%. GOOGL stock is at 5.8% while Amazon and Nvidia are at 5.1% and 4%, respectively. TSLA stock has 3.3% share and META stock is at 2.8%.

How Much Will Nasdaq 100 Megacaps Be Cut?
Based on Nasdaq 100 methodology, the combined weight of the five companies with the largest market caps will be set to 38.5%. The five-largest companies, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Nvidia had a combined weight of 46.7%. That suggests some notable reduced weightings for these names.

Meanwhile, no component outside the top-five market cap companies can have a Nasdaq 100 exceeding the lesser of 4.4% or the weight of the stock with the fifth-largest market valuation. That points to at least a slight decline in TSLA stock's weight.

The official reweightings should be released on Friday, perhaps after the close. That will also include stocks that will see increased weightings.

Magnificent Seven Soar In 2023
The Invesco QQQ ETF (QQQ), which tracks the big-cap Nasdaq index, was up 37.5% in 2023 through July 7. The First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weighted Index ETF (QQEW), which gives an equal weight to all 100 stocks, is up just 18.8%.

This largely reflects massive moves by megacaps this year. NVDA stock has nearly tripled (191%). META stock has soared 141% while TSLA stock is up 123%. AMZN stock has leapt 54.5%. AAPL stock has run up 47% and MSFT stock nearly 41%. Google stock is up a still-robust 35%.

There is some concern that this handful of names is distorting the health of the overall stock market, which is likely what's spurring the special rebalancing.

Will Nasdaq 100 Special Rebalance Affect Stock Prices?
The Nasdaq 100 special rebalance will spur stock allocation shifts among ETFs such as QQQ and mutual funds that track the index. So there could be some one-off gains or losses, perhaps as the planned changes are announced on July 14.

However, the impacts may be modest. For one, the big-cap Nasdaq index is going to adjust weightings, vs. a full addition or deletion. Also, far more money tracks the S&P 500, which is why S&P 500 component changes get a lot more attention than Nasdaq 100 moves.

The S&P 500 index, unlike the Nasdaq 100, is a pure market-cap weighted index.

Most of the ""magnificent 7"" stocks retreated Monday. Nvidia stock fell just 0.8%, while Apple slipped 1.1%. more than 1% intraday. Microsoft stock retreated 1.6%, TSLA 1.8% and Amazon 2%. GOOGL stock sank 2.5%.

The one exception: META stock climbed 1.2%, as Meta's new Threads app topped 100 million sign-ups in less than a week.

Megacaps weighed on the Nasdaq 100, which fell intraday before eked out a gain. The equal-weight QQEW jumped 1.8%.",100,47,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14w58g3/nasdaq_100_plans_special_rebalance_to_curb/
2023-07-04 18:57:31,Amazon,AMZN,What is your process for discovering/reviewing stocks?,"I've been trading for a couple of years and lately I've been doing very well by paying attention to relationships and divergences among stocks/ETFs/commodities. Trying to understand and exploit the ebb and flow among sectors. Attempting to identify where long-term accumulation is taking place. First and foremost I watch SPY/QQQ/IWM, ES/NQ/RTY, VIX/VX, DXY/USD, and the 10Y. I also watch the SPDR Sector Funds like XLK, XLF, XLV, XLU, XLY, XLE, XLP, XBI, etc. Additionally, IWC (micro-caps) and IJH (mid-caps). 

And VTI (whole stock market ETF) and VT (whole world market ETF) I watch on the weekly chart to get a sense for where the world markets are trending in general. I haven't branched into other markets much, mainly focused on identifying 

1) where the current strength in the market is 

2) whether the market is remaining orderly/non-volatile 

3) how much divergence is taking place among sectors/stocks (e.g. last year felt like indiscriminate selling, this year the divergences are tremendous)

For individual stocks, I basically rifle through stocks with setups that interest me and I really lack organization for what I have on my charts during a trading day. I use Thinkorswim and typically have about 20 charts up across 3 monitors. It's been a challenge to manage my screen real estate and I still change things up all the time, haven't found a solid methodology I guess for what I have pulled up. Undoubtedly what you have pulled up can effect what you trade, how you perceive the market throughout the day, etc. 

A lot of times I have AAPL, TSLA, GOOG, AMZN, up at all times. From there I have a mix of stocks from other sectors, maybe a couple wildcards like a small cap/squeeze name. But generally my goal is to display to myself options that I'm unlikely to be severely wrong on, or end up taking a big loss on. I go through and adjust what I'm looking to every night, but admittedly I do need more organization, journaling, and operating more systematically.  

So what is your process for evaluating the market? Discovering stocks and setups. What do you have open during the trading day? How many charts? Do you purposefully limit what you see? Do you use any websites/tools to organize your watchlist(s)? Give me your wisdoms",40,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14qnqfd/what_is_your_process_for_discoveringreviewing/

2023-06-28 09:11:20,Amazon,AMZN,Top Cathie Wood stock near the buy point is expected to deliver 772% EPS growth.,"Cathie Wood often invests in speculative companies with profits that are years away, though Tesla (TSLA) has been profitable for years. So has Shopify (SHOP), a top-10 Ark Invest holding. Thanks to a strategic shift, Shopify earnings growth is expected to skyrocket in 2023, with strong gains continuing next year. And SHOP stock is near a buy point.

  
**Shopify Logistics Sale**  
Shopify announced the sale of its fulfillment business to privately held Flexport on May 4, with the deal closing in June. The e-commerce software giant in recent years had sought to challenge Amazon.com (AMZN) in third-party fulfillment for online orders. But it turned out to be an ""expensive experiment.""  
Shopify now holds a 13% stake in Flexport, but exiting logistics will mean the company can slash costs. Meanwhile, gross merchandise growth is picking up after slowing sharply following the coronavirus pandemic boom.

**Shopify Earnings**  
Shopify earnings plunged to 4 cents a share in 2022 from 64 cents in 2021. The end of the pandemic meant a big slowdown in e-commerce growth.  
  
First-quarter earnings, reported May 4 along with the Flexport deal, tumbled 50% vs. a year earlier. Sales grew 25% to $1.51 billion.

**Shopify Earnings**

First-quarter earnings, reported May 4 along with the Flexport deal, tumbled 50% vs. a year earlier. Sales grew 25% to $1.51 billion.

**SHOP Stock**  
Shopify stock gapped up 24% on May 4 following first-quarter earnings and the Flexport deal, blasting out of a cup-with-handle base. After peaking at a 52-week high of 65.54 on May 10, shares began to consolidate. SHOP stock briefly broke out to a fresh 52-week high in mid-June, but pulled back with the broader market.  
  
This Cathie Wood stock has once again found support at the 21-day line. Investors could still use 65.64 as a place to start or add to a Shopify stock position. The risks would be elevated if the market pullback is still ongoing.

**Ark Invest Stake**  
Ark Invest owns 0.68% of Shopify stock as of June 26. It's the 8th-largest holding across Cathie Wood's Ark ETFs, with a 3.85% weight overall.  
  
While SHOP stock has been a big winner for Ark Invest in 2023, its current position is still underwater. The ARKK, ARKW and ARKF funds have an average cost of $121.32-$128.27.  
  
That's not uncommon. Ark Invest has a big profit in its current Tesla stock holdings. But the other top-10 Cathie Wood stock positions are losers right now, with some more than 75% below Ark's cost basis.

2023-06-26 09:32:17,Amazon,AMZN,Tesla just turned a huge financial burden into a $12.9 billion revenue opportunity.,"* Tesla recently added two of the world's largest carmakers to its EV charging network.
* Just weeks later, more automobile manufacturers are making -- or considering -- the move.
* Some investors are viewing this as an opportunity comparable to Amazon's rollout of AWS.

# The electric vehicle maker might be having an ""AWS moment.""

The past couple of years have been a bumpy ride for Tesla (TSLA). After rocketing to an all-time high in late 2021, the stock plunged more than 70% in the face of high inflation, rising interest rates, and the worst stock market downturn in more than a decade. But the tide appears to have turned over the past several months. Since bottoming in early January, Tesla shares have been on fire, gaining 149% as of this writing.  
What caused this epic run? A rebound in the stock market and the recovering economy were no doubt contributors, but the biggest gains have come over the past few weeks in the wake of a few historic announcements. Several big-name automakers have ceded the high ground, joining the Tesla Supercharger network and adopting its North American Charging Standard (NACS) connector, which is now on the road to becoming the industry standard on the continent.  
This stampede of partnerships prompts the question: Is Tesla having an ""AWS moment""?

# The agreements driving Tesla stock higher

Late last month, Ford announced that beginning early next year, Ford electric vehicle (EV) owners would gain access to more than 12,000 Tesla charging stations across the U.S. Ford's chief customer officer, Marin Gjaja, cited Tesla's ""large, reliable and efficient charging system"" as the incentive.  
  
Just weeks later, General Motors announced that it, too, would join the Tesla Supercharger network. On Tuesday, Rivian jumped on the bandwagon, joining the company's North American network, while Hyundai is considering a similar move. 

In each case, the automakers have noted that after initially requiring an adapter, they would equip future EVs with an NACS charge port within the next couple of years, eliminating the need for adapters going forward.

# The cloud connection

Back in 2000, Amazon (AMZN) was hamstrung by a number of growth-related issues, the biggest being the ability to scale its nascent operations. To address this challenge, the company developed a cloud infrastructure system that would form the foundation for its growing e-commerce business.  
  
At the time -- and unbeknownst to Amazon executives -- the company had planted the seeds that would eventually become Amazon Web Services (AWS), its lucrative cloud computing service. After being used solely by Amazon employees for several years, the service debuted to the public in early 2006, and the company began renting out the cloud infrastructure it originally developed for in-house use. And the rest -- as they say -- is history.   
  
AWS quickly become one of Amazon's most lucrative enterprises, a paradigm that continues to this day. In 2022, AWS generated revenue of more than $80 billion, up 29% year over year. More importantly, the cloud computing business was responsible for just 15% of Amazon's total revenue but all of its operating income -- even subsidizing the losses from its e-commerce operations. 

The company is still the leader in the cloud business it pioneered, closing out the first quarter with a 32% share of the cloud infrastructure market, which is as much as the shares of Microsoft and Alphabet combined, according to data supplied by research firm Canalys.   
  
The parallel here is clear. Tesla originally developed the Supercharger network solely for use by its customers, but it appears to be transforming into a lucrative industry standard.

# AWS moment?

The ability to take a substantial business costs and turn them into a hefty revenue generator is a rare thing, which is why some are calling this Tesla's ""AWS moment."" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives is one such commentator. He notes that while the company is known for accelerating EV adoption around the globe, Tesla's Supercharger network is the hidden gem that will take the company -- and its stock -- to the next level:   
  
I believe ""what has changed"" for the Street over the last month is the recognition with the Ford and GM supercharger partnerships that Tesla's sum-of-the-parts valuation is now finally starting to get tapped into. This reminds us of when the Street started to realize the margin story and valuation at AWS for Amazon.  
  
He goes on to estimate that the pacts with Ford and GM could add another $3 billion to Tesla's EV charging revenue ""over the next few years.""  
  
Piper Sandler agrees and is more precise in its estimates, estimating that charging from non-Tesla customers could add $3 billion to revenue by 2030, surging to $5.4 billion by 2032. A greater number of EVs on the road -- from numerous automakers -- will no doubt accelerate this ""flywheel effect,"" enriching Tesla and its shareholders along the way.   
  
The company is also vying for roughly $7.5 million in subsidies offered by the Biden administration to expand its Supercharger network if other automakers have access to its system. In all, this amounts to nearly $13 billion in additional financial incentives for Tesla to open up its network.   
  
It's also worth noting that Tesla also has a significant advantage over its rivals with one of the most cost-effective chargers in the business. The company has been able to construct charging stations for as little as $42,000 per connector, compared to a range of $100,000 to $250,000 for its rivals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Tesla can use the additional funds from non-Tesla customers to expand its Supercharger network, further fueling the flywheel.   
  
While it's still early days for these charging collaborations, this could eventually be a big revenue generator for Tesla.

# The fine print

As previously noted, Tesla's stock price has soared this year -- up nearly 50% in the past month alone -- as a result of the recent announcements, with a commensurate increase in its valuation. The stock currently has a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 77 and sells for over eight times forward sales -- a lofty valuation by any measure. For context, analysts expect the company to grow revenue by 22% and 29%, respectively, in 2023 and 2024. Value investors will no doubt balk at the stock's hefty price tag.  
  
That said, Tesla is the undisputed leader in the U.S. EV market and is just beginning to flex its charging station muscles. If the company eventually adopts a similar strategy for batteries and energy storage solutions, Tesla's recent gains could be just the beginning for those with a long-term outlook.

2023-06-15 05:00:44,Amazon,AMZN,How Shopify ($SHOP) 'shape shift' made e-commerce firm attractive again,"E-commerce software and services provider Shopify ($SHOP) suddenly looks a lot different to investors in the wake of a strategy shift. Canada-based Shopify in early June completed the sale of its fulfillment unit, easing investor angst over rising investments for SHOP stock.  
  
With the move, Canada-based Shopify slashed capital spending and improved its financial outlook.  
  
""Post the recent 'shape shift' where it exited the logistics business and reduced over 20% of the workforce, the company is free cash flow positive,"" said UBS analyst Kunal Madhukar in a recent report.

  
**Covid Emergency E-Commerce Boost**  
Further, Shopify stock has jumped 90% in 2023 as of June 14. Shopify stock has gained 42% since the company announced the sale of the fulfillment business to privately held Flexport on May 4. SHOP stock rebounded from a 2022 sell-off spurred by worries over growing investments and management turnover.  
  
Shares are trading near a 14-month high, trying to clear a short consolidation forged after surging on May 4 following the first-quarter earnings report and the Flexport deal.  
""While SFN (Shopify Fulfillment Network) turned out to be an expensive experiment, we also must recognize that Shopify made a fast pivot — taking calculated risks can sometimes lead to strategic mistakes,"" said Baird analyst Colin Sebastian in a report. ""We still believe Shopify can be a trillion-dollar GMV (gross merchandise volume) platform with take rates expanding as the company widens in scope.""  
  
In 2022, Shopify's GMV growth slowed to 12% ($197.2 billion). GMV growth has been trending down since 2020 when it boomed 96% during the coronavirus pandemic. Consumers shifted to online shopping during the emergency. In addition, Shopify in 2022 accounted for roughly 18% of all U.S. e-commerce, says UBS.  
  
According to research firm Gartner, Shopify is the largest e-commerce software provider with about 15% global share, ahead of SAP (SAP) and Salesforce (CRM). Shopify garners nearly two-thirds of revenue from the U.S.  
  
Shopify sets up e-commerce websites for businesses. It partners with companies such as Stripe to handle digital payments. Well-funded and fast-growing Stripe has put off an initial public offering.  
  
Among merchants services is Shop Pay. It's an accelerated checkout option for stores on the Shopify platform. Shopify Capital provides loans to merchants. The new Shop Cash rewards program provides consumers with incentives, aiming to boost GMV through higher orders.  
  
**SHOP Stock: PayPal Friction?**  
Meanwhile, Shopify has encroached on PayPal Holdings (PYPL), said Lisa Ellis, analyst at SVB MoffettNathanson in a report.  
  
""PayPal and Shopify have a long-standing partnership and PayPal enjoys a privileged position on the Shopify platform,"" said Ellis in a report. ""However, many of Shopify's payments-related initiatives pose a competitive threat to PayPal.""  
  
She noted Shopify Payments, a payment processing service offered through Stripe. Ellis also noted a ""buy now, pay later"" consumer financing service that Shopify now offers through Affirm Holdings (AFRM).  
  
Meanwhile, to build up a logistics business that stored and shipped products for its merchant customers, Shopify had acquired Deliverr for $2.1 billion in 2022. In 2019 it bought startup 6 River Systems for $450 million.  
  
Flexport will be Shopify's logistics partner under a revenue-sharing arrangement. Shopify now holds a 13% equity interest in Flexport.  
  
**Shopify To Join Amazon Buy With Prime?**  
Amid the sale, there's also speculation over a possible Shopify deal with e-commerce giant Amazon.com (AMZN).  
  
Amazon now offers its massive distribution network to merchants that do not sell goods on its website. Amazon's product fulfillment services are part of a program called Buy With Prime.  
  
At UBS, Madhukar says Shopify could join the Buy With Prime program based on management comments on Shopify's first-quarter earnings call.  
  
""The company said things are moving positively in their discussions with Amazon on BwP, which could suggest they may be closer to getting a deal done,"" Madhukar said. ""Although it is still unclear whether a deal will make SHOP whole on gross profit dilution, a resolution could result in a better merchant and consumer experience, and lead to higher volumes that may offset any potential dilution.""  
  
Also, Shopify rival BigCommerce (BGIC) uses Amazon's fulfillment services.  
  
Started in 2006, Shopify recently hiked contract prices for merchants.  
  
In the quarter ended March 31, Shopify earned one cent per share on an adjusted basis, down a penny from a year earlier. Revenue for SHOP stock rose 25% to $1.5 billion, the company said.  
  
Analysts expected the Shopify earnings report to show a loss of 4 cents on revenue of $1.435 billion. Gross merchandise volume rose 15% to $49.6 billion, topping estimates of $47.75 billion.  
  
In 2023, Wall Street analysts expect adjusted profit to boom to 33 cents a share from 4 cents last year. Shopify earnings per share is projected to rise 70% to 56 cents in 2024.  
Revenue will rise 20% to $6.74 billion this year and 18% in 2024 to $7.93 billion, analysts predict.  
  
Shopify Stock: Enterprise Marketing Push  
To spur GMV growth for SHOP stock, Shopify has partnered with Facebook (FB), Pinterest (PINS) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google in social media marketing.  
  
Meanwhile, analysts expect Shopify to target larger companies.  
  
In May, Shopify launched a program called Commerce Components. It enables businesses to integrate Shopify's checkout and back-office services with their existing online platforms. Further, toymaker Mattel (MAT) is one early customer.  
  
""Subscription pricing increase that rolled out at the end of April will be a key catalyst supporting topline growth and margins,"" said Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney in a report. ""And Shopify continues to drive product innovations, especially for enterprise solutions. Commerce Components offers a lightweight solution for large enterprises without replacing the merchants' whole online infrastructure.""",26,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/149t8tf/how_shopify_shop_shape_shift_made_ecommerce_firm/
2023-06-09 09:07:00,Amazon,AMZN,"How US stocks rose 20% from their lows, and where they might be going","U.S. stocks have defied fears of a recession, a banking crisis and soaring Treasury yields to rise 20% from their October lows - one definition of a bull market.  
  
The benchmark S&P 500 index closed at a low of 3,577.03 on Oct. 12, 2022, down 25% from its all-time high after the Federal Reserve unleashed a series of bruising interest rate increases to fight decades-high inflation.  
  
On Thursday, it closed up 0.6% at 4,293.93, amid growing optimism over the economic outlook and a rate hiking cycle that appears to be nearing its end. Here are some features of the index's rally, and a look at where stocks might go from here.

While markets seldom rise in a straight line, the S&P 500's journey from the bottom took 164 days - the longest 20% climb from a bear market low in five decades. Among the factors holding stocks back was a surge in Treasury yields to their highest levels in decades that dulled the allure of equities by offering investors the potential to earn attractive income in government-backed bonds.  
  
A crisis that saw the biggest bank busts since the Great Recession also shook investor confidence, as did worries over a potentially catastrophic fight over lifting the U.S. debt ceiling.

The narrow breadth of the S&P 500's rally has been a concern for some investors, with just seven stocks - Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Meta (META.O), Nvidia (NVDA.O) and Tesla (TSLA.O) - responsible for almost all of the index's gains this year. Many investors view these stocks as safe bets in uncertain times. Their gains were also driven by excitement over advances in artificial intelligence.

More recently, however, the market's gains have shown tentative signs of broadening out to other stocks.

Meanwhile, volatility has subsided - not only in stocks, but in Treasuries and currencies.  
  
One reason for the calm in markets is investors' belief that the Fed is unlikely to deliver many more of the rate hikes that shook asset prices last year.  
  
Investors have also been encouraged by evidence showing that the U.S. economy continues to be resilient in the face of the central bank's monetary tightening, while inflation slowly cools. The U.S. Citigroup Economic Surprise Index (.CESIUSD) shows U.S. economic data has in aggregate topped market expectations, helped by stronger than expected numbers for employment and consumer spending.  
  
A 20% gain from bear market lows has in the past heralded further upside for stocks.

In four of the last six bear markets, the S&P went on to rise 20% or more in the six months after hitting this milestone.

2023-06-02 04:12:42,Amazon,AMZN,What should I focus on when evaluating a stock if I want to be somewhat conservative?,"I recently read an article in Forbes titled ""Investment Advice From The Vietnam Veteran Who Turned A 2-Bedroom House Into A $4.7 Billion Fortune"" about Arte Moreno and his response to one of their questions made me curious:

>**Forbes: What assets are you buying in this environment?**

>Moreno: There are some stocks in the market right now I like. They get banged up, but I like the asset and you can average down if you look at it that way. Pretty much everything I deal with has some type of return on it; some kind of dividend. If you look back a year ago, we had very low interest rates, like zero. So when you're looking at a stock and not only do you really like the asset, but then they're giving you a dividend, it’s such a bonus. You're setting yourself up for potential stock growth, but you're also receiving 3% to 4% annually.

> I really try to stay by the book: I like to buy companies at around 15 times price-to-earnings. I have a couple strong positions in Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Apple (AAPL). I've been buying Apple forever; every time it goes down, I buy more Apple. I also buy JPMorgan (JPM), which pays about 3% dividend. Another company I really like, and have been invested in for a long time, is Blackstone (BX). The multiple doesn’t fit in there because it's high, but I just like their whole portfolio of assets.

> I’m really pretty good about keeping diversified. But I really look at stocks that give you a good dividend. I look at a company that's not generating any cash, has no dividend and has this crazy high PE multiple, and I just stay away. I think it's for other people. It's not for me.

He considers himself a fairly conservative and by the book investor, so I was interested in learning more about how you guys evaluate a stock and what you think of his approach.

For example, one stock that I've been looking at off and on for quite a while now, but don't own, is POSCO (PKX).  They're currently at a 9.32 PE, which is below the 15x that Arte Moreno looks for, but they have a 3.90% dividend and they're generating cash. Is that info enough to make an investment or do you look for more?

Thank you for any help you can provide. I'm genuinely interested in learning more about investing. I have a couple funds for retirement, but I was considering adding another account at Vanguard to invest in maybe 4-5 companies I like once I learn more.",4,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13y2nse/what_should_i_focus_on_when_evaluating_a_stock_if/

2023-05-29 11:19:17,Amazon,AMZN,"Powerhouse Picks: META, AMZN, or NFLX - Unveiling the most compelling FAANG stock"," 

# Meta Platforms ($META)

Shares of social media giant Meta Platforms have rallied by a phenomenal 107% year-to-date. The company impressed investors by returning back to revenue growth in the first quarter (after three straight quarters of decline) despite subdued digital ad spending due to macro pressures.

Investors have also cheered the company’s aggressive cost-cutting and streamlining efforts, including thousands of layoffs. Despite the distraction caused by regulatory matters, most Wall Street analysts remain optimistic about Meta’s prospects.

Meta’s user base continues to expand, with daily active people (number of users who visited at least one of the family apps –Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp in a day) growing 5% year-over-year to 3.02 billion (on average) in March. The company expects capital expenditure of $30 billion to $33 billion this year toward the build-out of its artificial intelligence (AI) capacity to support ads, Feed, and Reels as well as increased investment in generative AI initiatives.

**Is Meta a Good Stock to Buy?**

On Tuesday, Piper Sandler analyst Thomas Champion reiterated a Buy rating on Meta Platforms stock with a price target of $270 after taking a deep look at the company’s AI capabilities.The analyst sees the company leveraging AI to boost user engagement, develop better and more automated advertiser tools, and create an open-source AI ecosystem. Champion is also optimistic about Meta’s positioning within the digital ads space.

## Amazon ($AMZN)

Like Meta, Amazon is also reducing its costs to navigate a tough business backdrop. The company’s retail business has been under pressure due to the impact of macro challenges on consumer spending. Additionally, the slowdown in the growth rate of the higher-margin Amazon Web Services (AWS) business has also been concerning. Enterprises are moderating their IT budgets, which is weighing on AWS’s growth.

Wall Street continues to be bullish on Amazon and sees solid potential in the retail and AWS divisions over the long term. Moreover, AMZN’s rapidly growing advertising business is also expected to boost revenue in the years ahead. Despite macro pressures, Amazon’s ad revenue increased 23% year-over-year to $9.5 billion in Q1.

**Is AMZN a Buy, Sell, or Hold?**

Earlier this week, Mizuho analyst James Lee increased his price target for Amazon to $160 from $145 and reiterated a Buy rating, calling the stock his top pick for the second half of 2023. The analyst expects multiple expansion as concerns about the company’s AI market position “diminish.”

Recent channel checks by Lee’s firm with a leading channel partner indicated that AWS’s generative AI demand has been accelerating due to the ease of transition and product differentiation.

“Case studies show that AWS wins over clients on intelligence privacy and data security,” said Lee. Further, he also highlighted that generative AI is priced meaningfully higher than conventional computing, so it is expected to be both revenue and margin accretive to AWS. Consequently, Lee believes AWS revenue growth will likely trough in Q2 before rebounding in the second half of the year.

## Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)

Netflix’s crackdown on password sharing has improved investor sentiment about the streaming giant. Password sharing has been a key concern for Netflix, especially as competition has become intense in the streaming space. Netflix had previously estimated that over 100 million households share accounts, representing 43% of its global user base. This week, Netflix rolled out its password-sharing crackdown to its home market.

Aside from the password-sharing crackdown, Netflix’s business is expected to improve through its recent introduction of a cheaper, ad-supported tier.

**What is the Price Target for Netflix?**

On Thursday, Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein increased the price target for Netflix stock to $450 from $415 and maintained a Buy rating in reaction to the launch of paid sharing offering at $7.99 per additional household stream.

Prior to the announcement, the analyst’s firm conducted a survey of 1,800 U.S. Netflix consumers. The survey indicated a healthy propensity to pay for “remote” users, with certain abandoned users willing to pay for their own subscriptions.

While 45% of respondents indicated a willingness to pay for “remote” users, 70% indicated an inclination for the $6.99 ad-tier plan. With pricing of the paid sharing option above the ad-tier, the survey suggests a significant portion of these users will be pushed toward the ad-based offer.

# Conclusion

Wall Street is more bullish on Meta Platforms and Amazon compared to Netflix. Given the massive rally in Meta stock, Wall Street sees higher upside potential in Amazon stock from current levels. Analysts mainly see solid potential in Amazon’s AWS cloud business, supported by solid demand for cloud computing and prospects for growth in the AI space.",0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13us12c/powerhouse_picks_meta_amzn_or_nflx_unveiling_the/

2023-05-05 14:41:11,Amazon,AMZN,Netflix (NFLX) DCF Analysis.,"# INTRODUCTION:

NFLX has come a long way since being rejected by blockbuster, its secret formula being the first to embrace change. It embraced DVD at a time where VHS was still the dominant mode of display. It embraced Streaming when the world started catching onto DVD. NFLX's edge was that it always pivoted quickly to the next big thing. But NFLX’s massive progress may soon grind to a halt. From lackluster solutions to strong competitors and pure market saturation, NFLX has a tough road ahead.   
 

**INVESTMENT THESIS 1:**

*Overblown Growth Solutions*

When NFLX lost subscribers for the first time in 10 years, people freaked out and started selling off NFLX. But it seems that when NFLX announced its plans and after 1 successful quarter with some results from Ad-Tier NFLX bounced back up almost doubling from when it first dropped due to the shock.   
 

Ad-Tier has some parallels to pirated sites. Both stream contents with Ads injected into the mix, either before the video plays or on the side of the screen. The main difference is that one is free and the other costs $6.99/month.

There are only so many people in the world that wants a YouTube equivalent as their streaming platform. The people who purchase Ad-Tier are usually “seasonal” fans, those that purchase cheaply so that they can watch their favorite series and unsubscribe afterwards. These subscribers have no longevity to them and temporarily bump up NFLX’s numbers.  
 

Paid-sharing, getting people to get off shared accounts and getting their own accounts. Depending on how NFLX goes about it paid sharing could be a game changer for NFLX. There is already an existing customer base from those that are sharing account, they show a liking for NFLX but whether these customers will convert is dependent on certain factors Effectiveness of Paid-Sharing, ‘FOMO’ factor and Piracy.

Effectiveness of Paid-Sharing,   
Is the net cast wide enough to catch all the paid-sharing users? What are the ways we go about catching Paid-Sharing?

‘FOMO’ factor,   
Just how much are customers missing out will determine how they weigh the cost of monthly subscription and the ability to participate in the latest series.

Piracy,   
Is it easy to find alternatives that can provide what NFLX provides for free?

**INVESTMENT THESIS 2:**

*Strong Competitors & Lack of C.A.*

The usual suspects obviously include DIS, Hulu and AMZN prime. But, what about the less obvious ones?

TikTok & Instagram reels. There’s only so much entertainment needed in one’s life. You can’t possibly simultaneously watch TikTok while watching a NFLX series, your attention can only be paid in one direction. ([SOURCE](https://www.marketingdive.com/news/tiktok-netflix-gen-z-video-broadcast-app/634594/#:~:text=TikTok%20has%20jumped%20over%20Netflix,the%20sixth%20most%20popular%20service))

Or AMZN with an all-inclusive ride on their AMZN prime with AMZN prime offering other benefits on their online retail store. They are “Offer-Stacking” creating an unbeatable offer that NFLX can’t counter. 

DIS has a large vault of already created storyline that they have archived yet to be released onto Disney+ and the familiarity of DIS’ brand name enhanced by their theme park creates a very strong branding fit for the entire family that NFLX can’t parallel. ([SOURCE](https://www.statista.com/statistics/294111/leading-organizations-in-licensed-merchandise-worldwide/))

NFLX has no differentiator other than it was the earliest entrant and is now the largest entrant. There are certain exclusive content on NFLX that may make it appealing, but these kinds of advantages are superficial and over the long run, these exclusive content may offer their rights to stream to competitors or may be pirated.  
   
 

**INVESTMENT THESIS 3:**

*Market Saturation*

NFLX can only grow so much.

UCAN from FY21-22 only added 0.7M subscribers and LATAM added 3M. LATAM’s market was already said to be 75% penetrated by NFLX ([SOURCE](https://labsnews.com/en/articles/technology/netflix-streaming-leader-latin-america-future/)).

NFLX should focus on making its subscribers more valuable which management has said it will focus on now, but it has only so far laid out plans to attract new subscribers. 

Even if Linear Network loses most of its grounds in the next 10 years, NFLX may not gain much subscribers from Linear Network simply because Linear Network is mainly supported by the exact demographic that would not be on NFLX.  


# REVENUE:

***Model***

I’ve used a bottoms-up approach when modelling my revenue and forecasted using historical data and surveys done.

***Revenue/Subscriber***

NFLX applies third degree price discrimination in how it prices subscriptions/month for different regions. Regions where it has already established a presence and where NFLX integrated into their daily life, NFLX charges a higher subscription/month.  
 

But I don’t think every region will eventually tend towards the UCAN cost. Certain regions may see subscription services as a luxury good.  
 

Overall, with the implementation and wide rollout of the Ad Tier I project my average revenue/customer to be higher for every region as the Ad Tier generates higher revenue per subscriber monthly, according to management.

According to 2021 US Bureau of Labor Statistics, an American with Annual income of $78,743 and expenditure of $66,928 spent 0.97% of that amount in entertainment and of that 0.97% only 18% goes towards “Fees and admissions” so about 0.17% of $66,928 went towards NFLX. $654 represented the annual spending on subscription services + others. NFLX takes up 30% of this, most households have more than 1 subscription. So, NFLX is probably tethering at the limit at which it can raise prices.  
 

Comparing the cost per month of subscription between NFLX and its closest competitor DIS, Disney+ cost $4.80 compared to NFLX $15.86.  
    
So, I forecast that the majority of increase in Revenue/Subscriber for the US will come from wider adoption of Ad-Tier subscription which yields a higher amount of Revenue/Subscriber rather than NFLX increasing prices.

European subscription is one of the highest cost to subscribe ([SOURCE](https://beebom.com/how-much-netflix-costs-each-country-worldwide/)) so, I'd say its unlikely EMEA will raise monthly subscription cost but rather EMEA is the region with the highest likelihood to group subscribe to lower subscription cost. So EMEA is more likely to add subscribers than revenue/subscriber. 

**OVERALL, I assume that the full effects of FOMO for Ad-Tier will only show up from 2025 onwards.**  
 

***No. of Subscriber***

For Paid Sharing,   
NFLX has stated that the potential market could be up to 100+M households. I do also believe that convincing people who were previously sharing accounts of purchasing their own account may take some time to catch on, as they will have large FOMO after being locked out of their old account and missing the latest shows. And since NFLX only intends on fully releasing Paid Sharing from 23Q2 onwards, I believe the substantial addition to subscribers will only show up from 2025 onwards with the FOMO effect in full and Paid Sharing being rolled out entirely.  
 

For fall of Linear Network, 

([SOURCE](https://morningconsult.com/2023/03/28/linear-tv-viewership-gen-z-millennials/))

Almost 40% of Linear Network supporters are baby boomers. As the baby boomers age and decrease in numbers Linear Network will start losing its main customers, freeing up market share for NFLX to take as the younger generations start being associated with Streaming services, streaming will become the new norm.  
 

BUT, this cultural change will be one that takes time. It will not show up to a substantial amount in the time period of my forecast. So I opt for more granularity.    
   
**REVENUE MODEL: \[**[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/9c2expe)\]

# MARGINS:

The difficulty in figuring out margins is that there is no reliable historic data within the past 5 years. Margins were always extremely skewed by extreme conditions.

E.g. from 2019 to 2020 margins jumped from 12% to 18% due to covid accelerating the adoption of NFLX.  
OR in 2021 the marginal cost of acquiring content wrt to revenue being generated was the cheapest of the past 7 years at $0.5836 per $1 of revenue generated. Likely because people were embracing NFLX as tech adoption was accelerated prior year, margins peaking only a year later.

So, cost is broken down into 3 categories (Acquisition, Marketing and (Tech & Dev + G&A)). Tech & Dev + G&A are lumped together for more granularity instead of inaccurate forecasts.  
 

***Acquisition***

As NFLX transitions into subscriber retention mode rather than attracting subscribers it inevitably will spend more on making its services more attractive so that existing customers will face a higher “emotional” switching cost, so churn rate is lowered. But acquisition will continue to take the largest portion of cost.  


***Marketing***

Eventually the NFLX brand becomes more well-known or integrated into people’s daily life that they spend less on marketing themselves and more on advertising new content. Marketing costs will start to tend downwards. BUT there must always be a baseline amount of marketing cost to advertise new content.  
 

***Tech & Dev + G&A***

Tech & Dev + G&A is likely to remain elevated for the first few years as NFLX starts to roll out Ad-Tier and begin supporting a substantial amount of new subscribers from Ad-Tier. But eventually as the number of new subscribers dwindles down, NFLX gets more efficient and needs fewer employees. It will also implement new tech features e.g. AI tech support to lower the number of employees necessary. So at that point Tech & Dev + G&A will tend downwards.

 RFR (US) = 3.417%

WACC = 9.49%  


# CONCLUSION:

Ultimately, I’ve valued NFLX at $174.62, I just don’t believe in how astronomical growth could be, with all the changes that NFLX has introduced into the company. I believe that NFLX has set their priorities wrongly and are focusing on the wrong things, Subscriber growth shouldn’t be the focus it should be making our subscribers more profitable. It’s a good sign that they started caring and innovating again. But at the current trajectory I just don’t see it working out.

2023-05-04 10:33:25,Amazon,AMZN,"Without Amazon ($AMZN), this is what S&P 500 earnings would look like."," First-quarter earnings season is in full swing right now, with none bigger than last week's **Amazon.com** ($**AMZN**) numbers, which topped analyst estimates. The company is now responsible for a huge portion of the S&P 500's earnings performance.

 E-commerce giant Amazon is the largest contributor to earnings growth for the entire S&P 500 for the first quarter and 2023, according to John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet Research Systems.

If Amazon were excluded, Butters says, the blended earning decline (reported plus expected results) for the S&P 500 in Q1 would grow to -5.1% from -3.7%. And the estimated earnings growth rate for the entire S&P 500 this year would fall to 0.2% from 1.2%.

FactSet says that from a macro perspective, ""At the midpoint of the Q1 2023 earnings season, S&P 500 companies are recording their best performance relative to analyst expectations since Q4 2021. Both the number of companies reporting positive EPS surprises and the magnitude of these earnings surprises are above their 10-year averages.""

Amazon.com also is the largest contributor to earnings growth for the Consumer Discretionary sector. Excluding the company, the estimated 2023 earnings growth for the sector falls to 10.1% from 27.2%. 

 

## Amazon Earnings

On April 27, Amazon **reported strong first-quarter earnings and sales results** that topped Wall Street targets. Amazon earned 31 cents per share, up from the year-ago period's 38-cent loss. Meanwhile, revenue climbed 9% to $127.35 billion.

However, management said Amazon Web Services is seeing slower growth in April vs. Q1. First-quarter sales for the cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services, rose 16% to $21.4 billion, slowing from 37% growth in the year-earlier period. Analysts had projected AWS growth of 15% for the March quarter.

That spooked investors — $AMZN stock dropped 4% in response — because Wall Street analysts have expected **AWS revenue growth to trough** in the June quarter of 2023, then slowly reaccelerate. However, if the U.S. economy falls into a recession, the AWS slowdown could hit bottom later.

Looking forward, Amazon's 2023 earnings are expected to swing to a $1.56 per-share profit from 2022's 27-cent loss. Annual earnings are expected to jump 65% in 2024.

 

## $AMZN Stock Builds New Base

Amazon stock continues to consolidate in a **cup-with-handle base** that has a 110.96 **buy point**. $AMZN stock is about 7% away from that entry, as it rallied 1% Wednesday. A key flaw is that the stock spent the entirety of the base below the **long-term 200-day moving average**.

Keep in mind that Amazon is a longtime laggard, with a weak **relative strength line**. Plus, shares remain about 30% off their 52-week high, so there is plenty of **overheard supply** that could hinder the stock's rebound.

2023-05-02 23:54:47,Amazon,AMZN,Help: what do I do with AMZN?,"I have a lot of AMZN that was acquired prior to the downfall (at ~$150). Mistakes were made and I am still holding them.

I don’t need the money right now, but I still perceive a lot of risk in continue to hold that many stocks from 1 single company.

What is the general sentiment around AMZN stock at the moment? Is everybody on a similar boat, holding the bag in hopes it comes back up? Or have you lowered your expectations already and not expect it to go back to high $150s level ever again?

I don’t expect it to ever go back to $150 levels honestly, so I am just thinking should I sell now and avoid it going down even further? Or do we have hopes it hits at least $115 or $120 so the loss is not so big?

Sorry for such an open ended question, but hope you can chime in with your perspectives please. Thanks!",55,242,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1364iqz/help_what_do_i_do_with_amzn/

#[Stock futures fall after latest batch of earnings: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/27/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> U.S. stock futures fell Friday as investors digested the latest round of corporate earnings, including results from Amazon.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell by 108 points, or 0.3%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures slipped 0.3% each.
*****
> Amazon shares were down about 1% after initially rising following the online retailer’s first-quarter results. Meanwhile, Snap tumbled 18% in extended trading following a revenue miss. Pinterest shares fell 14% after issuing disappointing second-quarter revenue growth expectations.
*****
> The earnings season has been better than expected. Of the 261 S&P 500 companies that have reported earnings, about 80% have reported positive surprises, according to FactSet data.
*****
> Still, some traders expressed skepticism that this earnings season is strong.
*****
> “It doesn’t take us out of an earnings recession. We’re still in an earnings recession. And this calendar quarter, which we are in right now, we are going to see the most intense economic contraction and potentially the deepest earnings contraction of what will be a sequential three quarter decline,” Virtus Investment Partners’ Joseph Terranova said Thursday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.”
*****
> On the more positive side, Intel shares climbed more than 4% after the semiconductor firm beat estimates on the top and bottom lines.

*****
> On the economic front, traders will watch for the latest personal income and spending data, due out Friday before the open. Economists polled by Dow Jones are expecting core prices to have risen 0.3% in March from the prior month. That’s in line with the prior reading.
*****
> The final reading of the April consumer sentiment data is also set to be released Friday at 10 a.m. ET. It’s expected to show a reading of 63.5, which is the same as the previous readout.

*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 5 points, while S&P 500 futures added 0.2%, and Nasdaq-100 futures gained 1%.
*****
> Microsoft beat Wall Street’s expectations on the top and bottom lines in its latest quarter. The company also posted a big jump in revenue from its Intelligent Cloud business segment. Shares gained 8% in the premarket. Google-parent Alphabet posted better-than-anticipated earnings, however the stock dipped slightly as revenue grew by just 3% year over year.
*****
> “We’re still early in this season, but it seems like Wall Street generally underestimated corporate America once again,” said Callie Cox, an analyst at investment company eToro. “Company-level information could be easing investors’ fears on how corporate America is handling slowing growth and rising costs, especially given the focus on the job market.”
*****
> “There are a lot of eyes on how well tech holds up given it’s powered the market recently,” she added. “Big Tech has been through a lot of scrutiny, and expectations are already quite low for the sector. We expect Big Tech companies to focus on profitability and cost-cutting measures in their earnings commentary.”
*****
> Boeing, Hilton Worldwide and Spirit Airlines are scheduled to report their earnings results before the bell Wednesday. After the close, Meta Platforms, eBay and Mattel are due to report.
*****
> Traders are coming off a losing session, with the Dow falling about 344 points Tuesday. The S&P 500 finished 1.6% lower and the Nasdaq Composite dropped nearly 2%.
*****

The company said Tuesday its upcoming quarterly revenue will range from $700 to $750 million, compared to the expected $765.2 million from analysts surveyed by StreetAccount. Enphase reported adjusted earnings of $1.37 per share on $726 million in revenue, beating StreetAccount forecasts of earnings of $1.21 per share on $724.4 in revenue. Shares of rival Solaredge Technologies dropped 5.8%.

*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended little changed Friday and finished lower for the week as investors evaluated the latest earnings results and concerns of disappointing profits.
*****
> The 30-stock index added 22.34 points, or 0.07%, to end at 33,808.96, while the S&P 500 eked out a 0.09% gain to settle at 4,133.52. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.11% to close at 12,072.46.
*****
> All major indices finished the week in the red, with the Dow falling 0.23% to snap a four-week win streak. The tech-heavy Nasdaq saw the biggest decline, falling 0.42%, while the S&P slipped 0.1%.
*****
> “There’s the continued push-pull of the fact that the economy has been a lot more resilient than many people expected and corporate earnings have held up pretty well, all things considered,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance.
*****
> Even so, he noted that the Federal Reserve has raised rates substantially over the last year. Zaccarelli said that even if the central bank hikes as anticipated in May, it will likely hold rates at a higher level than the market expects.
*****
> “You can kind of see the the bull and bear case really right there in a nutshell as far as resilient economy with stronger-than-expected corporate earnings versus a very hot, very restrictive monetary policy coming from the Fed,” he said.
*****
> Earnings season continued Friday, with results from Procter & Gamble. The consumer products company gained 3.5% after beating expectations and lifting it sales forecast. As of Friday morning, 76% of S&P 500 companies reporting earnings so far have beaten analyst EPS estimates, according to FactSet.
*****
> Elsewhere, materials stocks were the worst performers, with Freeport-McMoRan falling 4.1%. Albemarle tumbled 10% as Chile said it would nationalize its lithium industry.
*****
> While companies broadly beat expectations this week, overall profit reports failed to boost stocks, with some investors fearing an earnings drop looms with a likely recession ahead.
*****
> “So far, earnings season is off to an uneventful start, with many companies meeting already reduced earnings expectations and that helps to explain the lack of movement in the major stock indices over the past few days,” said Carol Schleif, chief investment officer at BMO Family Office, adding that she expects stocks to trade in a tight range for some time.
*****
> Earnings continue next week with results on deck from Big Tech companies Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms and Microsoft.

> # Lithium: The Cycle Continues

> If you haven't checked the price of lithium lately, you might be in for a surprise. Spot prices for lithium carbonate in China have collapsed by two-thirds since hitting record highs in November of last year. Prices have gone from $84k per ton to $25k per ton. That unwinds the vast majority of a spectacular surge that played out from 2020 to 2022. Lithium initially surged 1,279% from July 2020 to March 2022 as part of the broader explosion of commodity prices and booming demand for electric vehicles, eventually peaking up 1,387% from the post-COVID lows. It's easy to forget that this critical battery input had already gone through one such cycle. A 224% rally in 6 months during late 2015 and early 2016 before a long, slow bear market that saw prices down 78% over several years.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/042123-Lithium-1.png))**

> In the equity market, the price cycle hasn't been as dramatic in percentage terms, but there has still nonetheless been a double cycle of surging stock prices in 2016 followed by a grinding bear market, and then an even more dramatic surge through late 2022 that is now sliding into reverse. On Thursday, Chile's government announced reforms to its lithium extraction policy. While existing contracts with firms that operate in the rich lithium brine deposits of the Chilean Atacama desert will be honored, the market is looking at weaker lithium prices and the fact that existing contracts will be replaced by less favorable ones 10+ years down the line and hitting lithium players. SQM is off 21% today while ALB is 10% lower.

> 1st half of April used to outperform the second half, but since 1994 that has not been the case. Traders are more focused on Q1 earnings and guidance during April than the Tax Deadline nowadays.

> # Jobless Claims Nearing New Highs

> Jobless claims have continued to weaken with this week's release, rising by 5K to 245K versus expectations of no change from last week's upwardly revised 240K print. At current levels, claims sit at the high end of the range since the start of 2022 and only a couple thousand below last month's high.

> Prior to seasonal adjustment, claims have essentially come in right inline with the reading for the same week last year and the few years prior to the pandemic.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/042023-Claims-2.png))**

> Continuing claims were equally disappointing this week rising to 1.865 million, 40K above expectations. Although the increase to initial claims has not resulted in a new high, the 61K increase for continuing claims leaves the indicator at the highest level since late November 2021.

This has pushed them ~10% above their 50-DMAs, and many are trading more than two (or even three for some) standard deviations above their 50-DMAs in extreme overbought territory.

> In the above table the “Worst Months” performance of DJIA, S&P 500, and NASDAQ have been separated by year of the four-year-presidential-election cycle going back to 1951 for DJIA and S&P 500 and 1971 for NASDAQ. NASDAQ’s “Worst Months” are July through October compared to May to October for DJIA and S&P 500. Even though pre-election years have historically been the best performing year of the four-year cycle, performance during the “Worst Months” has not been the least bit impressive. In 18 pre-election year “Worst Months” periods, DJIA has averaged a meager 1.14%. S&P 500 is only slightly better +1.81% while NASDAQ’s average is under 1%. Frequency of gains or percentage of time higher in pre-election years “Worst Months” is only slightly better than 50-50.

> Because of the elevated level of risk that has been historically observed during the “Worst Six Months” of the year and its historically tepid returns, reducing long exposure and developing a defensive strategy is the approach taken in the Almanac Investor Stock and ETF Portfolios. We do not merely “sell in May and go away.” Instead, we take some profits, trim or outright sell underperforming stock and ETF positions, tighten stop losses and limit adding new long exposure to positions from sectors that have a demonstrated a record of outperforming during the “Worst Months” period.

> For those with a lower risk tolerance or a desire to take a break from trading, the “Worst Months” are a great opportunity to unwind some longs and move into the relative safety of cash, Treasury bonds, gold and/or some combination of traditional defensive assets. For the first time in over a decade, cash can currently earn something other than zero. Preservation of capital may be more important than growth and with historical averages and frequency of gains reduced; the “Worst Six Months” are a good time to simply step aside if you prefer. August, September and/or October have provided some excellent buying opportunities over the years and could do the same again this year.

> # Sector Breadth All Over the Place

> In terms of price, the Industrials sector remains 5.75% below its high from January of last year and has yet to even take out the highs from earlier this year, but breadth has been more constructive recently. Just yesterday, the cumulative advance/decline line hit a new all time high.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/041823-Sectors-1.png))**

> Although that measure of breadth is making promising moves, other breadth measures have not exactly echoed that strength. In spite of the record high in the cumulative A/D line Monday, only 37% of the sector's stocks finished above their 50-DMAs. As shown below, of all other instances of a record high in the cumulative AD line, there has never been such a low reading in the percentage of stocks above their 50-DMAs. In fact, no other readings have even crossed into the 30% range! For the vast majority of previous highs, the percentage of stocks above their 50-DMAs has sat at 70% or more.


> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/041823-Sectors-2a.png))**

> All that is to say that most Industrials sector stocks are moving higher, but have not yet moved above potential resistance at their 50-DMAs. And even though the reading on the percentage of stocks above their 50-DMAs is low at the moment, that is not to say it is not improving rapidly. As shown below, it has risen sharply from the low of 19.18% on April 6th. Furthermore, whereas Monday's close only saw 37% of the sector finish above their 50-DMAs, as of mid-morning Tuesday the reading is already up another 8.2 percentage points to 45.2% as the average stock in the sector trades just 7 bps below its 50-DMA.

> # Volatility Is The Toll We Pay

> “It’s a proprietary strategy. I can’t go into it in great detail.” – Bernie Madoff

> Although Bernie Madoff was quite vague when asked how he had a strategy that printed money month after month when no one else could match it, as investors we know one thing and that is markets don’t always go straight up.

> Burt White, our Managing Director and Chief Strategy Officer, likes to say that volatility is the toll we pay to invest. No one wants to pay a toll, but sometimes you just have to do it to get where you are going. When I lived in Charlotte and would drive back up to Ohio for holidays, I’d have to pay the great state of West Virginia $4.25 three different times on I-77. I didn’t like it, but Santa brought the kids presents up there and I had to do it.

> Getting back to the stock market, volatility is that toll that we pay for enjoying longer-term returns. Below is a great chart that sums it up and thanks to our friends at Ned Davis Research for helping us with the data.

> Here’s what you need to know regarding the S&P 500:

> Each year sees more than seven different 3% percent dips.
More than three times a year do stocks correct 5%.
About once a year on average sees a 10% correction.
A 15% major correction happens every year-and-a-half.
A 20% bear markets happens about every three years.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/blog-1-1-800x301.png))**

> Another quote I like is from Regis Philbin when he said, “I’m involved in the stock market, which is fun, but sometimes very painful.” Well, this year has been fun for investors, but last year was quite painful.

> After more than a 120% rally off the March 2020 lows, maybe the bear market we saw last year shouldn’t have caught as many investors off guard like it did? We didn’t quite see a 25% bear market happening last year, but we expected as much as a 15% correction at some point. With the historically aggressive Fed, inflation soaring, China lockdowns, the war, and supply chains in disarray, it was a perfect cocktail for a bear market.

> The truth though is we get spoiled by the good times and when the rough times hit, we are almost surprised that bad times ever happen. Well, they do happen and it is all part of investing, or the toll we pay to invest. Just know this, volatility and bear markets have happened before and will happen again. The good new though is after this bad times, likely better times will be coming!

2023-04-18 23:52:46,Amazon,AMZN,How was eBay unable to keep up with Amazon?,"Arguably the two earliest starters in e-commerce to survive the tech bubble bursting, both Amazon (AMZN) and eBay (EBAY) positioned themselves well enough to thrive in Web 2.0. However, while Amazon today has become a behemoth ($1 trillion market cap and controlling an undisputed majority of online retail), eBay just kind of stagnated ($23.6 billion market cap, only about 10-15% of online retail despite being in second place to Amazon).

To be fair to eBay, nobody was going to match Amazon’s ambitions of expansion and world domination. That said, what was once a competitive rival for Amazon is now more of an afterthought than a challenger. I’m genuinely curious about how these two early starters grew so far apart.",15,68,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12r9btf/how_was_ebay_unable_to_keep_up_with_amazon/
2023-04-13 06:31:11,Amazon,AMZN,"Shopify ($SHOP) stock upgraded, claws above 50-day moving average"," **Shopify** ($**SHOP**) is the **IBD Stock of the Day** as the e-commerce firm popped above its **50-day moving average** Wednesday following an analyst upgrade. Shopify remains a controversial stock amid stiff competition.  

Started in 2006, Canada-based Shopify sets up e-commerce websites for small businesses and partners with others to handle digital payments and shipping.

 It competes with **Amazon.com** ($**AMZN**), **PayPal Holdings** ($**PYPL**), **Wix** ($**WIX**), **BigCommerce** ($**BIGC**), and several others.

On the **stock market today**, Shopify was up more than 4% at one point but gave back some of those gains as the market fell. Shares ended the trading day 1.2% higher to 45.30. Shares have climbed 30.5% in 2023 versus the Nasdaq's 14% gain in the wake of last year's downturn.

In a period of consolidation, Shopify stock has a traditional **entry point** of 54.76.

## Earnings Due For Shopify Stock

More aggressive investors could consider taking a position at 48.36 amid a handle still in formation. The handle would be in the lower half of the base, which is a flaw.

Earnings for Shopify stock are due in early May.  Investors may want to be cautious ahead of the earnings report. One strategy around earnings would use **call options**.

At JMP Securities, analyst Andrew Boone on Wednesday upgraded Shopify to market outperform from market perform with a price target of 65.

Further, Shopify is building a U.S. distribution network to store and ship products for its merchant customers. Rising investments for the distribution network have been one overhang on the stock.

## Amazon Ramps 'Buy With Prime' For Merchants

In addition, Amazon has launched a new initiative. Amazon is offering its massive distribution network to outside merchants. Merchants who do not sell goods on its website can use Amazon's product fulfillment services for delivery and returns as part of a program called Buy With Prime.

## SHOP Stock Gained During Pandemic

At MoffettNathanson, analyst Lisa Ellis also views Shopify as a market share taker.

""Selling shovels to miners in an e-commerce gold rush is the perfect business,"" Ellis said in a note. ""Shopify seized the opportunity of the (coronavirus) pandemic and now powers 10% of all U.S. e-commerce. The gold rush has slowed. Shopify's multiple has contracted as investors digest a secular growth story transitioning to one of increased capital intensity and questions on profitability.""

Meanwhile, Shopify stock holds an IBD **Composite Rating** of 85 out of the best possible 99, according to **IBD Stock Checkup**.

IBD's Composite Rating combines five separate proprietary ratings into one easy-to-use rating. Also, the best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.

Further, Shopify stock has an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B. That rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading. Its current rating indicates more funds are buying than selling.

## Shopify Stock: 2023 Revenue Outlook Missed

The rating, on an A+ to E scale, measures the institutional buying and selling of stock. A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy selling. Think of the C grade as neutral.

For the period ended Dec. 31, Shopify said it earned 7 cents per share on an adjusted basis, down 50% from a year earlier. Also, revenue for Shopify stock rose 26% to $1.7 billion, the company said.

Analysts expected the Shopify earnings report to record a loss of 1 cent on revenue of $1.65 billion. A year earlier, Shopify earned 14 cents per share on revenue of $1.38 billion.

For the first quarter of 2023, the company predicted revenue growth in the ""high teens."" Analysts had projected more than 20% revenue growth. And in January, Shopify hiked contract prices for merchants.",10,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12kes02/shopify_shop_stock_upgraded_claws_above_50day/
2023-04-05 23:48:43,Amazon,AMZN,What are some interesting tech stocks with actual EPS and is not a big tech?,"Actual EPS: Has positive EPS on a GAAP basis.  So this would not include companies that are not profitable on a GAAP basis, like Cloudflare, SentinelOne, Okta, etc.  And yes, I understand that non-GAAP is related to share-based compensation, but I just want to stay on the safe side.

2023-04-03 21:37:36,Amazon,AMZN,"Digital Age for Big Oil using Big Tech $HAL & $MSFT ; $AMZN & $BP, $SHEL","[https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/How-New-Technology-Will-Disrupt-The-Oil-And-Gas-Industry.html](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/How-New-Technology-Will-Disrupt-The-Oil-And-Gas-Industry.html)

 

At a certain point in its lifecycle, every industry faces its moment of reckoning with growing pressure to transform due to factors such as increasing competition, changing consumer preferences, government policy and other secular headwinds. The transformation usually takes the shape of improved supply chain discipline as well as streamlining business operations in order to achieve better operating margins.

For the oil and [natural gas](https://oilprice.com/admin/articles/Energy/Natural-Gas/Natural-Gas-A-Comprehensive-Guide-To-The-Worlds-Most-Crucial-Fuel.html) industry, the moment of truth arrived a few years ago after years of weak benchmark prices, shrinking margins and massive capital flight forced the sector to seriously rethink the way it does business with energy companies increasingly turning toward tech heavyweights for help in cutting costs and streamlining operations. 

A good case in point is [a partnership](https://www.hartenergy.com/news/halliburton-teams-advance-digital-capabilities-microsoft-accenture-188653) struck between **Haliburton Co.** (NYSE:HAL), **Microsoft Inc.** (NASDAQ:MSFT) and **Accenture Plc.** (NYSE:ACN) in 2020. For years, Haliburton, one of the world’s largest oilfield services companies, has been plagued by shrinking margins and chronic underperformance. The company eventually made a deal with the two cloud giants to migrate its existing data centers to cloud and enhance digital offerings.

 Halliburton is hardly alone.

After years of dilly-dallying, oil and gas companies are now rapidly moving their IT infrastructure out to the Cloud as well as adopting Business Process Management (BPM) systems. This frequently results in a leaner, more agile organizational model whilst delivering significant cost savings.

Barclays estimates that the upstream market digital services industry will grow from less than $5 billion in 2020 to a more than $30 billion annual tab by 2025, thus enabling $150 billion in annual savings for oil producers. Opportunities for cost savings include cutting capital expenditures (capex) as well as selling, general and administrative (SG&A) costs and transportation operating costs.

According to Barclays, the digital age is finally dawning for the energy sector with the market poised to erupt over the next five years. Over the past few years, Microsoft has struck cloud partnerships with several Big Oil companies including **ExxonMobil** (NYSE:XOM), **Chevron Inc**. (NYSE:CVX) and Haliburton while Google’s parent company **Alphabet Inc.** (NASDAQ:GOOG)[ has significantly expanded](https://www.slb.com/newsroom/press-release/2019/pr-2019-0513-slb-google-cloud) its partnership with **Schlumberger Ltd.** (NYSE:SLB), another oilfield services giant. Meanwhile, **Amazon Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) offers digital services to the industry through Amazon Web Services[ oil and gas division](https://aws.amazon.com/), and counts **BP Plc**. (NYSE:BP) and **Shell Plc** (NYSE:SHEL) among its top clients.

 

In many cases, Big Oil’s digital makeover is quite extensive.

For instance, Halliburton kicked off multiple digital transformation projects during the pandemic. Thailand’s PTT Exploration and Production and Kuwait Oil Company were among the notable oil and gas companies that were awarded Halliburton contracts to implement digital transformation and enhance efficiency and production at their oilfields. 

For years, Big Oil has been using tech companies’ enterprise software in their highly complex operating systems--including  rig management operations and precise drilling techniques. However, they have traditionally been somewhat reluctant to hand over their treasure troves of valuable data mainly on cyber security concerns as well as the need to maintain competitive advantages, preferring instead to develop most of their software developed in-house or by companies within the oilfield services sector such as Haliburton. 

However, this is now changing as they look for ways to improve operational efficiencies in a bid to squeeze higher cash flows and profits from their existing operations. 

Is the new approach working? The evidence seems to suggest so, with shale drilling costs on an encouraging downtrend. **J.P. Morgan** estimates that Permian's Delaware Basin oil drillers now require oil prices of just \~$33/bbl to break even down from $40/bbl in 2019. ",8,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12ays6h/digital_age_for_big_oil_using_big_tech_hal_msft/

2023-03-28 09:45:06,Amazon,AMZN,Apple (AAPL) to Spend Billions More on Entertainment,"From [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/apple-to-spend-billions-more-on-entertainment-7370447)

""Apple Inc. (AAPL), the world's most valuable company, is mulling a billion-plus dollar foray into movie theaters and sports streaming in an attempt to drive subscriber growth for its Apple TV+ streaming platform.

KEY TAKEAWAYS Apple could spend more than $1 billion a year to ramp up its movie releases and sports streaming.

The company is reportedly in talks with film studios to partner on theatrical releases of movies by Martin Scorsese and Ridley Scott.

Previously, Apple has devoted most of its $6.5 billion film and TV budget to television programs.

The move could help to drive viewers to Apple's streaming platform, Apple TV+, which lags far behind competitors like Amazon and Netflix.

Apple is expected to spend $1 billion a year to produce movies for theatrical release.

The company is reportedly in talks with movie studios to partner on the releases of upcoming movies by Martin Scorsese, Ridley Scott, and others.

The company is also reportedly considering bidding on the streaming rights to English football games.

The new plans constitute a significant increase in Apple's entertainment spending that could be part of an effort to draw more interest in Apple TV+, which lags behind rivals in subscriptions. Apple TV+ has an estimated 40 million subscribers, compared with at least 200 million each for Amazon's (AMZN) Prime Video and Netflix (NFLX).

Apple also lags behind rivals in content spending. The company spent about $6.5 billion on movies and television in 2021, while Amazon and Netflix spent $9 billion and $17 billion respectively.

So far, Apple's greatest streaming success has been in television, with the acclaimed series Ted Lasso. The business of releasing movies for wide theatrical distribution may be more complex, particularly given theater chains' struggles to rebound from COVID-19 and fend off competition from streaming services. Movie ticket sales are about a third below 2019 levels. Chains like AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (AMC) have attributed the sluggish sales to a shortage of available films.

Apple's distribution agreements may help boost ticket sales, and it is not the only tech company entering theaters. Amazon acquired major studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for $8.5 billion last year and now plans to make up to 15 movies for theatrical release each year.

In each case, Apple and Amazon may attempt to drive streaming viewership by later releasing those films on their respective platforms.

Apple's interest in adding English football games to its streaming platform follows last year's $2.5 billion 10-year streaming deal with U.S. Major League Soccer. Terms of a potential deal between Apple and the UK's Premier League have not been disclosed.""

Personally, this sounds like the kind of move that more streamers (looking at you, Netflix) need to make. They aren't going to be throwing ridiculous money at it, but the content they are looking to produce is starting to look more like HBO level quality. If they have acclaimed directors like Scorsese and Ridley Scott on board, they could get their films in with a big theatrical release, make a shit tonne of money, THEN bring it onto streaming (much like Paramount did with Top Gun Maverick) for a bigger subscriber gain. Sounds like a win win win to me and we all know Apple has $billions in pocket change to throw at this.",261,82,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/124jghc/apple_aapl_to_spend_billions_more_on_entertainment/

# **Stocks close higher Friday as investors try to shake off latest bank fears: Live updates - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/23/stock-futures-are-up-slightly-as-investors-weigh-bank-troubles-fed-decision.html)**
*****
> Stocks rose Friday, reversing their earlier session declines as Deutsche Bank shares pared back some losses.
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 132.28 points, or 0.41%, closing at 32,238.15. The S&P 500 rose 0.57%, while Nasdaq Composite ticked up 0.3%. The major indexes all had a winning week, with the Dow gaining 0.4% week-to-date as of Friday afternoon, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq gained 1.4% and 1.6%, respectively.
*****
> Deutsche Bank’s U.S.-listed shares slid 3.11% Friday, rebounding from a 7% drop earlier in the trading session. A selloff of shares was triggered after the the German lender’s credit default swaps jumped, but without an apparent catalyst. The move appeared to raise concerns once again over the health of the European banking industry. Earlier this month, Swiss regulators forced a UBS acquisition of rival Credit Suisse. Deutsche Bank shares traded off their worst levels of the session, which caused major U.S. indexes to also cut their losses.
*****
> “I think that the market overall is neither frightened nor optimistic — it’s simply confused,” said George Ball, president at Sanders Morris Harris. “The price action for the last month-and-a-half, including today, is a jumble without any direction or conviction.”
*****
> Ball added that Deutsche Bank is “very sound financially.”
*****
> “It could be crippled if there’s a big loss of confidence and there’s a run on the bank. There is, however, no fundamental reason why that should occur, other than nervousness.”
*****
> European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde tried to ease concerns, saying euro zone banks are resilient with strong capital and liquidity positions. Lagarde said the ECB could provide liquidity if needed.
*****
> Investors continued to assess the Fed’s latest policy move announced this week. The central bank hiked rates by a quarter-point. However, it also hinted that its rate-hiking campaign may be ending soon. Meanwhile, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that credit conditions have tightened, which could put pressure on the economy.
*****
> On Thursday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said regulators are prepared to take more action if needed to stabilize U.S. banks. Her comments are the latest among regulators attempting to buoy confidence in the U.S. banking system in the wake of the Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank closures.
*****
> “Retail [and] institutional investors are both looking at the banking system, but now internationally. That’s dangerous,” Ball added. “Banks exist because of confidence in their stability, and that confidence can be eroded as we now see, via social media and technology in a matter of minutes.”

> # Best and Worst Stocks Since the COVID Crash Low

> We are now three years out from the COVID Crash low, and even with the past year's weakness, most assets continue to sit on solid gains. For major US index ETFs, the S&P Midcap 400 (IJH) is up the most having slightly more than doubled while the S&P Smallcap 600 (IJR) is not far behind having rallied 95.9%. Value has generally outperformed growth, especially for mid and small-caps although that has shifted somewhat this year. For example, while its gains have been more middling since the COVID crash, the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) has been the strongest area of the equity market in 2023 thanks to the strength of sectors like Tech (XLK) and Communication Services (XLC). Although those sectors have posted strong gains this year, they have been the weakest over the past three years while Energy (XLE) far and away has been the strongest asset class. Paired with the strength of energy stocks has been solid runs in commodities (DBC)more broadly with the notable exception being Natural Gas (UNG) which has lost over 40%. Bond ETFs are similarly sitting on losses since the COVID Crash lows. As for international markets, Mexico (EWW) and India (PIN) have outpaced the rest of the world although Emerging Markets (EEM) as a whole have not been particularly strong; likely being dragged on by the weaker performance of China (ASHR) which holds a large weight on EEM.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-COVID-Low.png))**

> Taking a look at current S&P 500 members, nearly half of the index has more than doubled over the past three years. As for the absolute best performers, Energy stocks dominate the list with four of the top five best-performing S&P 500 stocks coming from that sector. Targa Resources (TRGP) has been the absolute best performer with a nearly 900% total return. Other notables include a couple of heavy weight stocks: Tesla (TSLA) and NVIDIA (NVDA) with gains of 563.9% and 412.9%, respectively.

> On the other end of the spectrum, there are currently 25 stocks that have posted a negative return since the COVID Crash low. The worst has been First Republic Bank (FRC) which has been more of a recent development. Whereas today the stock has posted an 83.1% loss, at the start of this month it would have been a 65% gain. Another standout on the list of worst performers has been Amazon (AMZN). Most other mega caps have more than doubled since the March 2020 S&P 500 low, however, the e-commerce giant has hardly offered a positive return.

> # Sector Performance Experiences a Historical Divergence

> The first quarter of 2023 is coming to a close next week, and checking in on year to date performance, there has been a big divergence between the winners and losers. Although the S&P 500 is up 2.84% on the year as of yesterday's close, only three of the eleven sectors are higher. Not only are those three sectors up on the year, but they have posted impressive double digit gains only three months into the year. Of those three, Consumer Discretionary has posted the smallest gain of 10% whereas Technology and Communication Services have risen 17.2% and 18.1%, respectively. The fact that these sectors are home to the main mega cap stocks -- like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOGL), which have been on an impressive run of late -- helps to explain how the market cap weighted S&P 500 is up on the year without much in the way of healthy breadth on a sector level.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-Sector-1.png))**

> One thing that is particularly remarkable about this year's sector performance is just how rare it is for a sector to be up 10%+ (let alone 3) while all other sectors are lower. And that is for any point of the year let alone in the first quarter. As we mentioned in yesterday's Sector Snapshot and show in the charts below, going back to 1990, there have only been two other periods in which a sector has risen at least 10% YTD while all other sectors were lower YTD. The first of those was in May 2009. In a similar instance to now, Consumer Discretionary, Tech, and Materials were the three sectors with double digit gains back then. With those sectors up solidly, the S&P 500 was little changed on the year with a less than 1% gain. As you can see below, though, by the end of 2009, every sector had pushed into positive territory as the new bull market coming out of the global financial crisis was well underway.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-Sector-2.png))**

> The next occurrence was much more recent: 2022. Obviously, it was a tough year for equities except for the Energy sector which had a banner year. Throughout most of the year, the sector traded up by well over 20% year to date even while the rest of the equity market was battered.

> # The Fed Expects Banking Stress to Substitute for Rate Hikes

> The Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate by 0.25% at their March meeting, bringing it to the 4.75-5.0% range. This is the ninth-straight rate increase and brings rates to their highest level since 2007. However, the most aggressive tightening cycle since the early 1980s, which saw them lift rates all the way from near zero to almost 5%, is near its end.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-23-Fed-target-rate-601x800.png))**

> Up until early February, Fed officials expected to raise rates to a maximum of about 5.1% and hold it there for a while. However, since that time, we’ve gotten a slew of strong economic data, including elevated inflation numbers. This pushed fed officials to give “guidance” that they expected to raise rates by more than they estimated back in December.

> Market expectations for policy also moved in conjunction. Prior to February, markets expected the Fed to raise rates to 5% by June, and subsequently lower them by about 0.5% by the end of the year. But strong incoming data and Fed guidance pushed expectations higher, with the terminal rate moving up to 5.6% and no cuts in 2023.

> # The Silicon Valley Bank crisis changed everything
> The bank crisis that erupted over the last couple of weeks resulted in a significant shift, both in expectations for policy and now the Fed as well. See here for our complete rundown on SVB and the ensuing crisis.

> Market expectations for Fed policy rates immediately moved lower. Markets expected the stress in banks to translate to tighter credit conditions, which in turn would lead to slower economic growth and lower inflation.

> This was nicely articulated by Professor Jeremey Siegel, one of the foremost commentators on financial markets and fed policy, in our latest episode of the Facts vs Feelings podcast, Prof. Siegel said that tighter credit conditions, as lending standards become more strict, are de facto rate hikes.

> Fed Chair Powell more or less said exactly the same thing after the Fed’s March meeting. The 0.25% increase was an attempt to thread the needle between financial stability and fighting inflation. Fed officials also forecast the fed funds rate to hit a maximum of 5.1%, unchanged from their December estimate. This is a marked shift from what was expected just a few weeks ago, with Powell explicitly saying that tighter credit conditions “substitute” for rate hikes.

> # There’s a lot of uncertainty ahead
> While the recent bank stresses are expected to tighten credit conditions and thereby impact economic growth and inflation, there are a couple of open questions:

> * How big will the impact be?

> * How long will the impact last?

> These are unknown currently. Which means future policy is also unknown.

> Fed officials expect to take rates to 5.1%, i.e., one more rate increase. And then expect to hold it there through the end of the year. In short, they don’t expect rate cuts this year.

> Yet investors expect no more rate increases and about 0.6% of rate cuts in the second half of 2023. Markets expect the policy rate in June to be at 4.8%, while expectations for December are at 4.2%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-23-implied-policy-rate-differential-600x800.png))**

> There’s clearly a huge gulf between what the Fed expects versus what investors expect. This will have to reconcile in one of two ways:

> * Market expectations move higher – if economic/inflation data remain strong and credit conditions don’t look to be tightening significantly.

> * Fed expectations move lower – if the banking sector comes under renewed stress, credit conditions could tighten significantly and eventually lead to weaker data.

> Things are obviously not going to go in either direction in a straight line. It’s going to be a bumpy ride as new data points come in, not to mention news/rumors of renewed problems in the banking sector.

> # Seasonality Keeps Claims Below 200K?

> Initial jobless claims remained healthy this week with another sub-200K print. Claims fell modestly to 191K from last week's unrevised reading of 192K. That small decline exceeded expectations of claims rising up to 197K. Given claims continue to impress, the seasonally adjusted number has come in below 200K for 9 of the last 10 weeks. By that measure, it has been the strongest stretch for claims since last April when there were 10 weeks in a row of sub-200K prints. Prior to that, from 2018 through 2020 the late March and early April period similarly saw consistent readings under 200K meaning that some of the strength in the adjusted number could be on account of residual seasonality.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032323-Claims-1.png))**

> In fact, this point of the year has some of the weeks in which claims have the most consistently historically fallen week over week. Taking a historical median of claims throughout the year, claims tend to round out a short-term bottom in the spring before an early summer bump. In other words, seasonal strength will begin to wane in the coming months.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032323-Claims-2.png))**

> While initial claims improved, continuing claims worsened rising to 1.694 million from 1.68 million the previous week. Albeit higher, that remains below the 2023 high of 1.715 million set at the end of February.

> # A Fed Day Like Most Others

> Yesterday's Fed decision and comments from Fed Chair Powell gave markets plenty to chew on. As we discussed in last night's Closer and today's Morning Lineup, there have been a number of conflicting statements from officials and confusing reactions in various assets over the past 24 hours. In spite of all that uncertainty, the S&P 500's path yesterday pretty much followed the usual script. In the charts below we show the S&P's average intraday pattern across all Fed days since Powell has been chair (first chart) and the intraday chart of the S&P yesterday (second chart). As shown, the market's pattern yesterday, especially after the 2 PM ET rate decision and the 2:30 PM press conference, closely resembled the average path that the market has followed across all Powell Fed Days since 2018.

> The S&P saw a modest bounce after the 2 PM Fed decision and then a further rally right after Powell's presser began at 2:30 PM. That initial post-presser spike proved to be a pump-fake, as markets ultimately sold off hard with a near 2% decline from 2:30 PM to the 4 PM close.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032323-Fed-Comp-1a.png))**

> So what typically happens in the week after Fed days? Since 1994 when the Fed began announcing policy decisions on the same day as its meeting, the S&P has averaged a decline of 10 basis points over the next week. During the current tightening cycle that began about a year ago, market performance in the week after Fed days has been even worse with the S&P averaging a decline of 0.99%. However, when the S&P has been down over 1% on Fed days (like yesterday), performance over the next week has been positive with an average gain of 0.64%. As always, past performance is no guarantee of future results.

> # What Now? An Update on Recent Bank Stress.

> It’s been less than 2 weeks since Silicon Valley Bank’s stunning 48-hour collapse, and a few more banks have been caught in the fray. New York regulators closed the doors on Signature Bank on Sunday, March 12. A week later, US banks injected $30 billion into First Republic Bank to keep it afloat, and UBS acquired rival Swiss bank Credit Suisse in a government-brokered deal. In the midst of the chaos, your Carson Investment Research team was there for you with client-facing content, professional advice, and investment solutions. In fact, we think this event presents an opportunity to invest in the more stable large-cap financial companies and recently upgraded the sector to overweight in our House Views Advice.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Mar22_1-1600x927.png))**

> # Why is this happening?
> The rapid hike in interest rates caused an asset and liability mismatch for banks. Due to many years of low-interest rates, banks invested assets in interest-earning loans and bonds that would be repaid over the next five-plus years, which at the time was a logical way to earn a higher yield. Regulators considered government bonds to be among the safest ways a bank could invest its capital. As interest rates rose, bond values dropped. Interest rates rose at the fastest pace in history, and the safe assets that banks invested in lost value to the tune of more than $620 billion in unrealized losses as of the end of last year. This decline in value left weaker banks underwater and, when coupled with depositors pulling money out, caused them to collapse or seek costly capital raises.

> # Why this matters to investors?
> The weakness in the banking sector will likely lead to tighter lending standards, potentially slowing economic growth. The reason we’re in this mess, to begin with, is that the Fed hiked interest rates to slow the economy because inflation was rising too quickly. Perhaps the 16% drop in oil prices over the past two weeks reflected this slower growth and bodes well for continued falling inflation. Thus, the Fed is closer to achieving its goal.

> Maybe it’s an overreaction as “banking crisis” headlines stir painful memories of 2008. Either way, an environment with slower growth and lower inflation isn’t a bad time to invest. Bonds and stocks could both perform well, especially stocks of companies with the ability to grow earnings. We also reiterate our House Views Advice overweight on the large-cap Financials sector. The largest US banks are well-capitalized and are gaining market share from the smaller regional banks. We believe this calamity provides an opportunity for stronger banks and investors to capitalize on.

> # FANG+ Flying

> As we noted in today's Morning Lineup, sector performance has heavily favored areas like Tech, Consumer Discretionary, and Communication Services in recent weeks. Playing into that sector level performance has been the strength of the mega-caps. The NYSE FANG+ index tracks ten of the largest and most highly traded Tech and Tech-adjacent names. In the past several days, that cohort of stocks is breaking out to the highest level since last April whereas the S&P 500 still needs to rally 4% to reach its February high.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032223-FANG-1.png))**

> Although FANG+ stocks have been strong recently, that follows more than a full year of underperformance. As shown below, relative to the S&P 500, mega-cap Tech consistently underperformed from February 2021 through this past fall. In the past few days, the massive outperformance has resulted in a breakout of the downtrend for the ratio of FANG+ to the S&P 500.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032223-FANG-2.png))**

> More impressive is how rapid of a move it has been for that ratio to break out. Below, we show the 2-month percent change in the ratio above. As of the high at yesterday's close, the ratio had risen 22.5% over the prior two months. That comes up just short of the record (22.6%) leading up to the pre-COVID high in February 2020. In other words, mega-cap Tech has experienced near-record outperformance relative to the broader market. However, we would note that this is in the wake of last year when the group had seen some of its worst two-month underperformance on record with the worst readings being in March, May, and November.

> # March Seasonality Prevails, Banking Fiasco Be Damned

> It’s encouraging typical March seasonal patterns have overcome recent bank failures, recession talk and fearmongering. The early March pullback was steeper than normal, but the usual mid-month rebound appears to be materializing.

> Last week’s gains could be an indication we have seen the worst of the banking fallout and the end of the pullback. Triple Witching Weeks have tended to be down in flat periods and dramatically so during bear markets. Positive March Triple Witching weeks in 2003 and 2009 confirmed the market was back in rally mode.

> The week after March Triple Witching is notoriously nasty. S&P is down 27 of the last 40 year – and frequently down sharply. Positive or flat action this week would be constructive.

> In the old days March used to come in like a bull and out like a bear. Nowadays March has evolved into an inflection point where short-term trends often change course. The market is clearly at an important juncture and it’s a good time to remember Warren Buffet’s wise words to “Be greedy when others are fearful.”

> Bank failures are never a good thing, but the swift actions of regulators likely prevented further damage to the industry. At the least, the banks are likely to be under even greater scrutiny going forward. In the near-term we expect more volatile trading. Further out we expect the market, and the economy will recover like they both have historically done.

> # Nasdaq Leaves the S&P in the Dust

> Looking at the major US index ETF screen of our Trend Analyzer shows just how disconnected the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) has become from other major index ETFs recently. As shown below, as of Friday's close, QQQ actually finished in overbought territory (over 1 standard above its 50-DMA) whereas many other major index ETFs were oversold, some of those to an extreme degree. On a year to date basis, the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) has rallied more than 14% compared to low single digit gains or losses for the rest of the pack.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/usindexqqq.png))**

> Historically, the major indices, namely the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, tend to trade at similar overbought and oversold levels. In the chart below we show the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500's distance from their 50-DMAs (expressed in standard deviations) over the past five years. As shown, typically the two large cap indices have seen similar albeit not identical readings. That is until the past few weeks in which the two have diverged more significantly.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032023-SPX-NDX-2.png))**

> On Friday there was more than 2 standard deviations between the Nasdaq's overbought 50-DMA spread and the S&P 500's oversold spread. As shown in the chart below, that surpassed recent highs in the spread like the spring of 2020 to set the highest reading since October 2016.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032023-SPX-NDX-2.png))**

> Going back to 1985, the spread between the Nasdaq and S&P 500 50-DMA spreads diverging to such a degree is not without precedent, but it is also not exactly common. Friday marked the 16th time that spread eclipsed 2 standard deviations for the first time in at least 3 months. Relative to those prior instances, the current overbought and oversold readings in both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are relatively middling. However, only the instance in early 2000 similarly saw the Nasdaq technically overbought (trading at least a standard deviation above its 50-DMA) while the S&P 500 was simultaneously oversold (at least one standard deviation below its 50-DMA).

2023-03-16 19:15:21,Amazon,AMZN,"safe haven The stock market is red-eyed. At present, it is not only bank stocks but also energy stocks that are killing.","Market commentary has pointed out that last year's big tech stocks are now safe havens.

GOOGL 2.28%

META 1.92%

MSFT 1.78%

AMZN 1.39%

The auto industry is currently in a recession, and TSLA will be affected, so it has been a little weak recently.

Chip design duo AMD and NVDA have not been dragged down by semiconductors and bucked the trend today. INTC came back from failure, rising 9.35% in the first five trading days.

One strategy is to only buy stocks that have risen sharply rather than stocks that have fallen sharply, because from the lessons of last year, we can understand that thunderstorms have no bottom. Even META TSLA has experienced a collapse of more than 70% from its high point.

There's no way I'm going to pay that so my other option to move the stocks that I have in moo moo is to just sell them and rebuy them back in Fidelity. 

The only stock I actually bought with moo moo was Amzn(the others were shares just given to me)when it was $111. I bought $1,000 worth. It's obviously down right now so I was curious if it's better for me to sell it now at a loss and get the tax break for next year or just wait for it to go back to what I bought it for and then sell it and rebuy it in Fidelity.

2023-03-13 16:09:59,Amazon,AMZN,Keep portfolio / Sell portfolio and put all into Term Deposits. What would you do?,"Hi guys! I'm looking for some advice / points of view on something. For the last couple of weeks i've been thinking and thinking what i should do with my portfolio / investment strategy. So, I'm from Europe, and i currently have some money invested into the US market + some spare money (I'll show the percentages below). Right know, i have some spare money and i have the possibility to it into some Term deposits with maturity from 1 month, up to 3 years, which i think pays out quite good or just keep DCA into the market.

Ok so first, my portfolio right now is still positive overall and it looks like this: VOO - 25%, QQQ - 18%, NVDA - 12%, AAPL - 11%, MSFT - 10%, GOOGL - 7%, RKLB - 3%, UNH - 3% and the rest 11% split into V, ASTS, MA, HD, AMZN, TGT, DIS, BA and TSLA. For the past year or so, i didn't add anything to individual stocks and just DCA into VOO/QQQ every month.

Now, the banks right now have these interests (i've selected from different banks, the best ones for each maturity period): 1 month - 5.7%, 3 months - 7.3%, 6 months - 7.5%, 1 year - 8.2%, 2 years - 8.45%, 3 years - 8.7%. But before you say holy s\*\*t, these are good returns, right now, here, the inflation rate is at 15% (which in reality i think it's even worse), so it's not that great if you look at it that way.

Looking at the market right now, 7.5% or 8.2% seems pretty good. I know the market average return is around 8% to 9% but I'm not sure the market is gonna have these kind of returns (at least the next few years?). But i could be right, i could be wrong of course. I just don't feel like it's gonna do great next period, that's all.

So now back to my dilemma... As i said, for the past year i just DCA each month into VOO/QQQ. Besides what's already invested, i have some spare cash i would like to deploy right now and i see these scenarios.

\- Sell the portfolio, and put it all + spare money + new money each month into term deposits (6 months or 1 year maturity)

\- Keep portfolio as it is and put spare money + new money each month into term deposits

\- Keep portfolio and put the spare money into it + DCA each month as usual and ignore the term deposits

If i missed something, maybe a better option or some information that i missed and might be really important to take into consideration, please tell me. Right now i'm something like 60/40 into second scenario. Just don't touch the portfolio, but put the rest of the money into these deposits (i was thinking the 1 year one may be the best one ?), until the market stabilizes a bit. Also, im in my twenties, so my investment hold period is long. I don't need the money any time soon (that's 1 of the reason why i think the option to keep DCA into the market may be better because of the compound interest?).

I could really use some advice on this guys. What would you do in this situation? Sorry if some terms are not right or something, as im not from US, some things related to investing may be different and i might wrongly translate them. Thanks a lot guys!

TLDR: You have spare money right now. How you choose to use it? Sell portfolio and put everything into Term deposits (at least for the next couple of years) / Keep portfolio and put rest into Term deposits / Ignore the Term deposits and keep DCA into the market as usual.",4,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/11qdthr/keep_portfolio_sell_portfolio_and_put_all_into/

In this scenario, I would incur a good faith violation, correct? Because I used the proceeds of a sale to purchase another security and then sold the newly purchased security before the original funds used to make that purchased had settled? Or am I incorrect?

Earnings: 3 cents per share

Revenue: $149.2 billion vs $145.42 billion, according to Refinitiv estimates

It is not immediately clear if the reported earnings are comparable to the Refinitiv analyst estimate of 18 cents per share. Wall Street is also watching several other numbers on the report:

Amazon Web Services: $21.87 billion, according to StreetAccount

Advertising: $11.38 billion, according to StreetAccount

Amazon likely closed out its worst year for revenue growth in its quarter century as a public company, and another quarter of single-digit sales expansion is expected, as the company grapples with waning consumer demand from inflation and a deceleration in its cloud business.

The company warned in its most recent earnings report that fourth-quarter revenue would rise just 2% to 8% from a year earlier.

Amazon shares lost half their value in 2022, when higher costs tied to inflation, the war in Ukraine and supply chain constraints forced the company to recalibrate after its pandemic-fueled growth. Meanwhile, consumers continued their return to in-person shopping and pulled back on discretionary spending, adding to Amazon’s pain.

Even the holiday season was seen as fairly lackluster. Amazon’s online stores segment is expected to show a revenue decline of 1.4% year over year, according to FactSet estimates.

“While there was an expected boost to consumer spend in late November around the Cyber Five period (the Thanksgiving holiday shopping weekend was Amazon’s biggest ever), this uplift was likely short-lived, with December retail sales declining 1.1% [month over month], the steepest decrease in 2022,” Canaccord Genuity analysts wrote in a note to clients earlier this week. The firm maintains a buy rating on Amazon’s stock.

CEO Andy Jassy’s efforts to reel in costs will be a major area of focus. In January, Amazon said it’s eliminating 18,000 jobs among its corporate workforce, after cutting a number of employees last November. The company has also instituted a hiring freeze in its corporate ranks, cut some projects and paused warehouse expansion in an effort to tame rising expenses.

Amazon Web Services is expected to show slowing growth during the fourth quarter as businesses softened their spending in an effort to cut costs. Cloud-computing rival Microsoft
 last week reported slowing expansion in its Azure unit.

AWS CEO Adam Selipsky said in an interview late last year at the company’s annual Reinvent customer conference that “we do see some customers who are doing some belt-tightening now.”

One bright spot could be Amazon’s advertising business, which is expected to post solid revenue growth during the quarter. Online advertising has come under pressure as inflation pushed some brands to recalibrate their budgets.

But Amazon’s ad business is poised to grow “at a mid-teen percentage range” in 2023, even against a tough macro backdrop, as sellers and vendors continue to buy targeted product ads, according to analysts at CFRA Research, which has a buy rating on Amazon shares.",259,158,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10s0w5l/amazon_earnings_are_out_here_are_the_numbers/

2023-01-21 15:59:50,Amazon,AMZN,Apple's business is simply an earnings machine. ROC comparison: Apple (23.7%) vs. Alphabet (12.3%) vs. Amazon (5.7%),"Source: Apple: Why Recent Underperformance Is A Buying Opportunity

Over the last few months, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has done something that it doesn't often do: underperform. Since the company's last earnings call on October 27th, the stock has broken away from the broader market, returning -4% while the S&P 500 (SPY) has delivered 8.5%.

The reason for this short-term underperformance isn't exactly obvious. Apple, after all, reported record revenues in its October earnings release, and Tim Cook announced that the company has yet to feel the sting of consumer softness in the economy.

Investors, however, don't seem to have believed him.

From worries about production issues in China to softening demand for the iPhone that investors seem certain will materialize at some point, investors just seem plain worried that something will go awry at the world's largest company. We contend in this article that these concerns are overblown and that the current underperformance represents a buying opportunity.

The China Worry

Apple has faced down a multitude of investor worries regarding its relationship with China. Apple has been accused of being too cozy with China, of making secret deals with China, of having its supply chain being too exposed to China, and of being cowardly when it comes to China.

While the veracity of these claims are better left to other authors, we don't think we're overstepping by saying that China has been made into a bogeyman for Apple investors. Apple has arguably done better than almost any other American corporation at walking the fine line that western companies must navigate in order to successfully do business in China.

The current top-of-mind China worries for Apple investors, however, are supply-chain issues and questions surrounding lockdowns and China's notorious zero-COVID policy. As long as the country is locking up millions of its citizens in forced isolation, things will be difficult for Apple.

Investors were delivered good news recently, then, when Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal reported that Chinese officials were scaling back COVID lockdowns, potentially re-opening the economy at a much faster pace than expected. Importantly, Vice Premier Hiu Le told an audience at Davos that Beijing's focus this year would be on ""boosting domestic demand.""

In other words, we believe that Chinese leadership's struggles with large scale problems such as population decline and slumping economic growth make it less likely to rock the boat with Apple, at least in the near term.

All of this bodes well for Apple's business in China, which beat analyst estimates last quarter with $15.6 billion in revenue. Apple further stands to gain in the near term from the collapse of the U.S. dollar's 2022 rally.

A strong dollar reduces a company's international sales because when revenues are recorded in dollars (as Apple's are), they must be converted. When one Yuan converts to fewer and fewer dollars, the effects on the income statement quickly mount. Thus, the dollar's recent decline is good news for Apple and American companies conducting business overseas in general. The easing of FX headwinds should give Apple's international sales--and Chinese sales in particular--a welcome boost.

A Robust Product Pipeline

Steve Jobs is rumored to have said at one point that Tim Cook wasn't ""a product guy."" The long line of releases that Apple has in store for 2023 would probably beg to differ.

Only three weeks into the new year, Apple has already re-launched its HomePod product as well as a slew of new Mac variations. A full list of potential releases can be found here, but amidst the rumors of an Apple Car, something else very interesting has emerged--an Apple VR headset, reportedly ready for launch this year.

This is the product that, we think, should keep Mark Zuckerberg awake at night. Meta (META) has been at the forefront of the VR headset realm for some time since it purchased Oculus in 2014. Widespread adoption of the technology, however, has been a bit slow to catch on, which could have something to do with the fact that Meta is not principally a hardware company.

Apple, of course doesn't have this problem. If the product does in fact launch in 2023, we expect that it will be maniacally engineered and deliver a user experience unmatched by current technology. Combine this with Apple's dedicated user base and app ecosystem, as well as Apple's influence with developers, and it's quite possible to envision Apple launching VR adoption into the mainstream.

History is on our side with this claim. At its launch the iPad was met with a notorious level of criticism. Many companies had attempted to create a tablet in previous years (including Apple--remember the Newton?), but just couldn't quite pull it off. The Apple Watch, too, was met with similar skepticism.

In short, if anyone can pull off a VR coup, we believe Apple can.

A Compelling Valuation

Over the past five years, Apple's stock has maintained a fairly consistent relationship to forward EBITDA.

Overlaid against each other, the stock has consistently tracked above forward EBITDA estimates. In 2022, estimates began to flatten as inflation took hold and recession fears set in and the relationship reversed, with the stock price falling beneath forward EBITDA. We believe that the current inversion of this historical relationship presents an attractive opportunity for investors. This reflects our belief that Apple's stock won't be stuck in the doldrums forever.

Analysts, too, believe that Apple has better days ahead.

Of the 45 analysts estimates tracked, the average price target is $168.82. With its current price of $135, Apple has an almost 25% upside to its consensus target.

Normally we take analyst targets with a grain of salt, but an interesting pattern seems to emerge in the lower pane of the above chart--each time Apple's stock price slumps causing the distance between price and target price to exceed 20%, the stock tends to respond to the upside.

Some investors may agree up to this point but wonder--why, in the face of rising interest rates, does Apple continue to deserve such a premium valuation? Shouldn't Apple, at some point, be affected by the same gravity that has pulled down the likes of Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) in the last year?

We're glad you asked, because a piece of the Apple puzzle that we believe is under-reported is the company's sheer efficiency. Apple's business is simply an earnings machine, reporting world-class returns on capital quarter after quarter.


In the last 10 years, Apple has averaged an eye-popping 23.7% quarterly return on capital, and performance over the past two years has been even stronger. For reference, we prefer return on capital over other metrics such as return on equity since ROC can be directly compared to a company's estimated cost of capital. Comparing those two figures is helpful in inferring the profitability and sustainability of a business.

Now, just for kicks, let's compare Apple's reported ROC with Alphabet and Amazon.

It isn't even close. Compared with Apple's 23.7% ROC, Alphabet's average quarterly ROC over 10 years was 12.3% (the bars in white), while Amazon's was 5.7% (the bars in red).

Apple really is that good.

The Bottom Line

In sum, we believe that Apple shares present a highly compelling opportunity for investors.

Apple's business is world-class, with best-in-industry returns on capital that continue to justify a premium valuation.

Fears about China--including FX headwinds--may dissipate or prove less impactful than feared.
Apple continues to innovate and is expected to bring fresh products to market in 2023.

There currently exists a price-EBITDA discrepancy which could present a compelling entry or position building point.

We believe a price of $165 for Apple is a fair target. That price represents a 24x multiple on estimated 2024 earnings, which is well within the stock's historical multiple trading range. We believe the premium multiple is justified for the reasons outlined above.",1191,204,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10hueqy/apples_business_is_simply_an_earnings_machine_roc/

NFLX holds $6.1 billion in cash equivalents and has $13.9b in long-term debt. Of the other five companies, with $41.8 billion at the end of last quarter, META has the lowest level of cash and equivalents.

NFLX had $21.57 billion in content obligations at the end of last quarter, and $4.3 billion of that will be spent within the next year. Herein lies a major stumbling block for me when I consider NFLX as an investment.

Competition within streaming companies results in enormous capex devoted to content creation. It appears to be a vicious circle for all content providers, and that includes the likes of Apple, Amazon and Alphabet, each of which is now in competition with NFLX.

However, Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet have a great deal of FCF to potentially devote to content efforts. For example, Alphabet generated $69.8 billion in trailing 12-month free cash flow. Trailing 12-month free cash flow for NFLX was a relatively paltry $717 million in 3Q22.

Furthermore, while the other five FAANMG’s have investment grade credit ratings, Moody's still rates NFLX at Ba1/positive, a notch below investment grade.

Analysts’ price targets support my observations. The average 12-month price target for META, AAPL, and MSFT are each roughly 30% higher than the current share prices. AMZN and GOOGL have price targets that are 66% and 61.7% above the current share valuations, respectively.

2023-01-08 01:58:22,Amazon,AMZN,Amazon(AMZN) DCF Analysis need criticisms and advice,"# HISTORY:

The story of AMZN is one of trials and tribulation, it was not always smooth sailing where valuation steadily rose over the years. Rather, it was one that required a visionary CEO, one who had sufficient foresight to take gambles that paid off, one who could stomach the choppy seas of business cycles, one who had the determination and patience to see through their largest gambles. Having a humble beginning, AMZN’s IPO MC was valued at $430 Million before losing 95% of their valuation in the tech bubble crash. AMZN managed to survive the tech bubble crash but their valuation held rather steady at around 17 billion in the early 2000s. Meaning investors believed that AMZN could no longer grow past this threshold and have matured. Reaching 17 billion in valuation by itself would’ve been an impressive feat but it wouldn’t be enough for a story worthy for the history books as companies like WMT had a valuation of about 200 billion at the same point in time. AMZN released prime in 2005, their X factor to differentiate themselves from their competitor. Net income was 588 million that year but due to large investments into prime net income in 2006 fell to 190 million nearly 67%. Consequently, from 2005 to 2006 AMZN's MC fell nearly 20%  as investors did not fully believe in prime. But Jeff Bezos, believing in his dream for fast shipping, was unfazed by the whole ordeal and carried on investing heavily into the retail business. And this investment paid off as today we know AMZN as the 5th largest company by market cap in the world.

Tl;dr: Jeff Bezos I love you please sponsor my University fees.

# INTRODUCTION:

AMZN business model involves a few revenue sources, in no particular order.

1. Online Retail + Physical Store (AMZN Store): Their online retail website that generates the bulk of revenue, as physical stores have mostly stagnated and occupy a meager amount of revenue I'll combine both Online Retail and Physical Store into AMZN store in my DCF.
2. Amazon Web Services(AWS): Their cloud computing services which helps take businesses big and small into the cloud. Providing servers as well for firms. Brian Olsavsky described AWS as a business that helps firms change their fixed cost into variable cost, meaning firms pay more as they use more.
3. Third Party Services(3P): AMZN has extended their retail transport capabilities to their competitors allowing third party to set up their store on the webpage, leaving the problem of transporting the goods to AMZN.
4. Advertising: The latest significant addition to AMZN's top line, AMZN sold the capability for advertisers to have their products more visible to customers on their retail store and providing tools for advertisers to analyze the data collected.
5. Subscription: Lastly, Amazon Prime. Consisting of Prime video, Prime Gaming and Prime shipping.
6. Others: representing the other businesses that AMZN has tried breaking into like Twitch but for simplicity sake and because Others represented about 0.5% of revenue in 2021 I'll not forecast this in my DCF.

# REVENUE:

**AMZN store**:  
2022, Retail has been hit pretty hard due to inflationary pressures and Ukraine War bumping up costs. Retail has definitely taken a hard beating for 2022. As per 2022 Q3 earnings transcript, ""reduction in fulfilment and transportation capital investment...to better align with demand."" We can expect revenue to have taken a hit and definitely lower than 2021's 22% Y/Y.

Past 2022 however, I expect AMZN store to pick up as there is a large demand for the convenience provided by AMZN.  ""more than 90 percent of consumers expect two- to three-day delivery as the norm, while 30 percent expect same-day delivery."" - [(JPMorgan,1)](https://www.jpmorgan.com/solutions/treasury-payments/insights/why-shopping-has-changed-forever). Only AMZN is well situated in terms of fulfillment center, transportation and capacity for expansion to meet this goal. In fact, AMZN is expected to be the largest e-commerce platform world wide by 2027 [(Statista,2)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/379046/worldwide-retail-e-commerce-sales/) earning about 1.2 Trillion.

AMZN store is likely to have very high growth going into 2023 until at least 2025. It took AMZN about 2 years to double their fulfilment network from 2019 - 2020 hence the negative cash flows back then. So I'm assuming AMZN is going to be an aggressive grower with high revenues and low margins as AMZN will be expanding into new markets it'll probably minimally need to spend another 2 years doubling its current size. Hence I project high growth period from 2023 - 2025.  


**AWS:**  
2022, firms are likely to be more conservative in these uncertain times preferring to have more cash reserves in hand. AWS offers a pay-as-you-go approach, not requiring firms to tie up large capital into AWS and AWS helps business to reduce cost. As per 2022 Q3 earnings transcript, ""we've seen an uptick in AWS customers focused on controlling cost"" All that being said, I don't really expect any crazy amount of growth in AWS as companies are more likely to have their capital tied up in footing the bill for higher labor cost. Even management forecast growth ""more in the mid 20% growth rate"". Compared to 2021's Y/Y at 37.1% so 2022's Y/Y is about 13% lower than 2021's Y/Y growth rate.

AWS is likely to have high growth as well going into 2023 as management announces plans to introduce AWS to more regions ""launch of the AWS middle east region in August and the recent announcement to launch AWS Asia Pacific."" The cloud computing is a whole new realm of endless opportunities for Amazon to capitalize on, with the market expected to grow from 548 billion in 2022 to 1240 billion in 2027, [(marketsandmarkets,3)](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/cloud-computing-market-234.html) AWS being in a good spot at about 38% market share as of Q1 2022, [(statista, 4)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/967365/worldwide-cloud-infrastructure-services-market-share-vendor/) to capitalize on this large market. Similarly I expect high growth period from 2023 - 2025.  


**3P:**  
I was thinking about how exactly should I go about forecasting third party but due to a lack of available data I actually forecast 3P with respect to AMZN store.

Of course this was not just a random guess, 3P has always observed a direct relationship with AMZN store. Taking 3P revenue as a percentage of AMZN store from 2016 - 2021 that number has held steady at  a range of 25% - 43%, it makes logical sense as well for 3P to have a direct relationship with AMZN store as 3P are retailers facing the same economical environment faced by AMZN store.

So throughout my DCF, I took 3P's revenue as 33% of AMZN store, 33% is the average of 25% and 43%.3P undergoes same growth period Y/Y as AMZN store.

&#x200B;

**Subscription:**  
Subscription was treated the same as 3P. My rationale for this was that you have to use AMZN store in order for a subscription to Amazon Prime to be useful for you. At least anecdotally, barring lord of the rings I have not really heard of any memorable titles on Prime Video. In fact, ""Seventy-nine percent of Amazon Prime users cite **free shipping** as the primary reason they subscribe to the service"", [(chainstoreage,5)](https://chainstoreage.com/technology/the-no-1-reason-people-subscribe-to-amazon-prime-is#:~:text=Seventy-nine%20percent%20of%20Amazon,%2C%20Twitch%2C%20or%20other%20benefits).

Subscription from 2016 - 2021 when taken as a percentage of AMZN store held steady at a range of 7% - 13%.

So throughout my DCF, I took Subscription's revenue as 10% of AMZN store, 10% being the average of 7% and 13%. Subscription undergoes same growth period Y/Y as AMZN store.  


**Advertising:**  
2022, I'd expect advertising to fall as the advertising industry has proven to be a cyclical one. Using GOOG as a proxy for example, advertising revenue for GOOG actually decreased Y/Y in Q3 so similar results can be expected for AMZN.

I won't expect very high growth for Advertising however as it is quite limited in terms of what can be advertised as compared to GOOG. For example, GOOG is able to advertise service companies but AMZN may not be able to advertise services on the retail webpage.

Regardless, AMZN is still a strong player in the advertising industry. By 2023, AMZN is expected to earn 7.1% of revenue in the digital advertising market worldwide, [(statistia,6)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/290629/digital-ad-revenue-share-of-major-ad-selling-companies-worldwide/).

I wouldn't expect much high growth for advertising as not much exciting news or technology was introduced for advertising that would significantly increase revenue.  


# EBIT:

As per Q3 2022 earnings transcript, ""drop in operating margin...we're working hard to make sure that current profitability is not the new normal."" Margins have taken a hit in 2022 due to higher labor costs from the tighter labor market and the Ukraine War affecting gas prices which affects energy prices affecting AWS' margins. I'd expect 2022's margins to be smaller than historical margins. The latest 3Y average margin was at 5.47%. Due to AMZN starting to lay off workers on 4th Jan 2023, I'd assume the margins were hit pretty hard, for them to have to further reduce expenses. Margins assumed at 4.5%.

AMZN's margins are not likely to significantly increase from 2023 - 2025 as AMZN is going to continue heavily reinvest back into the company so margins are most likely to go back to the norm of 5.47% by 2025 at the end of the high growth period.

But, as AMZN goes off their high growth period from 2026 onwards, margins are going to increase as they stop focusing on growing their business but start to become mature. I'd assume margins are about 9% by the end of my forecast period in 2031.  


# ASSUMPTIONS:

1. Taxes are taken to be 20%, 2021's tax rate was 19.26% so I'd assume in this similar conditions as closely as possible taxes are about 20%.
2. D&A taken to be 7% with respect to revenue, historically from 2016 - 2021 D&A with respect to revenue on average was 7%.
3. Other Ops Exp/Inc and Deferred income tax was omitted from being forecasted despite appearing on the cash flow statement as they were too meager so I opted for less granularity and omitted them.
4. Change in NWC taken to be -0.5% with respect to revenue, historically from 2016 - 2021 the average was -0.5%
5. CapEX assumed to be 11% for the high growth period from 2022 - 2025. Before decreasing to reflect a maturing company. A picture of CapEX and D&A side by side: [https://imgur.com/qfOJPNF](https://imgur.com/qfOJPNF)   
positive net asset balance was taken throughout forecast period.
6. TGR taken to be 2%.
7. WACC is taken at 9.2%, Calculations is as such.

# QUESTIONS & NOTES:

1. **WHY DID I GUESS AWS AND AMZN STORE ARE THE COMPONENTS GOING THROUGH HIGH GROWTH?**  
As per 2021 Q4 earnings transcript, ""40% of that capex is going into infrastructure, most of it feeding AWS...About just under 30% is fulfillment capacity, building warehouses -- warehouse only, not transportation. And then just under 25% is transportation capacity and building on our NACL network, principally globally."" So we can see AMZN believes in the growth of AMZN store and AWS so I think it's justified in my DCF to assume high growth for both.
2. **WHY DOES HIGH GROWTH STOP IN 2025?**  
AMZN’s actual valuation is very heavily dependent on how long the high growth period lasts for. No guidance was given for how long this period is going to be, but a decent guess for this would probably be 2 years from 2023. 2022 was a period of contraction from AMZN navigating higher labor costs and the Ukraine War. 2023 would be a good starting point for AMZN to begin expansion. Given that the AMZN network took 2 years to double. If 2 years later it doubles again to quadruple it is most likely able to also support other regions outside of the US to a competent degree.
3. **INACCURACY IN FORECASTING ADVERTISING**  
Data available for advertising is actually quite limited due to a lack of information from management and historically advertising has only been reported from 2019 onwards. As more financial reports become available for advertising the degree of accuracy of prediction increases, unfortunately only 3 years of data from 2019 - 2021 is available. The story for advertising business in AMZN is sadly just too murky and vague right now for me to paint you guys a decent scene.
4. **How much AMZN’s margins are actually going to be after the high growth period?**   historically AMZN always had low margins as they reinvested back heavily to the company. Once again a lack of suitable historical data, where we can observe how high margins could be with an average economical condition and with all investments paying off. 9% may be cutting it too little for AMZN, but better safe than sorry.
5. **LASTLY,**   
All my forecasting are based on me weighing all the factors and adjusting their impact according to how much impact I think they have. 

# CONCLUSION:

Ultimately, I value AMZN at $115.61, it is undervalued compared to market's $84. This difference can probably be attributable to how strong the market thinks AMZN's high growth will be compared to mine. But, I do think that there are a lot of doomsayers especially in the news where literally every other day I'd open my preferred news app and see at least 3 different article about how inflation has not eased off to a great extent. Barring short term expectations, I really do see AMZN being a strong company with great free cash flow potential. 2022's 10-K is definitely going to make or break how investors view AMZN moving forward, Questions like ""Can AMZN finally break their negative CF?"" will finally have an answer and give investor some kind of confidence. 4/5 of AMZN's revenue sources are cyclical so they'd be overly affected by the current environment's pessimism.   
I see this 37% of difference in price not as risk but rather as an opportunity because I believe AMZN will minimally bounce back 37% sometime in the future, the question is just when.

For the last time, I appreciate any advice or comments on my DCF I really spent quite a lot of time on this DCF juggling between scouring for data and army left me literally devoting 70% of my weekends getting data. I've read the story AMZN has told and retold it in my own account and I hope this value adds to anyone even if no advice was given!

> # The Labor Market Remains Strong

> The December payroll report was yet another upside surprise as far as employment data go. Monthly payrolls rose by 223,000, above expectations for a 200,000 gain. The unemployment rate was expected to remain at 3.7% but fell to 3.5% – tying for the lowest rate since the 1950s. This is not remotely indicative of an impending recession. However, what matters for markets is how Federal Reserve (Fed) officials react to the strong employment data.

> As inflation falls, much focus is going to be on the employment picture since this is what is going to matter for the Fed. Especially since they are focused on wage growth being a driver of underlying inflation, i.e., services ex housing, as Chair Powell noted after the December FOMC meeting. In their minds, a softer employment picture is required for inflation to get close to its target of 2% and remain there. If not, they are going to need to see a significant and persistent decline in price data to be convinced that inflation is heading the right way. Only then are we likely to start seeing rate cuts.

> The “problem” is that a slew of recent data suggests the labor market remains far from soft. Let’s walk through four key data points.

> 1.) Strong job growth

> Job growth has slowed from more than half a million at the beginning of 2022 to just under 250,000 over the last three months of 2022. But make no mistake, this is still a very strong pace of job growth. As Powell has noted, the economy needs to create about 100,000 jobs a month to keep up with population growth. And we’re more than double that currently.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Blog-2023-01-06-job-growth-600x800.png))**

> 1.) Labor demand still out-running supply

> Earlier this week, we got the November JOLTS data (Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey), which showed that job openings remain elevated at 10.5 million. It was around 7 million before the pandemic. Powell’s favored metric is the vacancy ratio, which is the ratio of job openings to unemployed workers – that is currently at 1.7, down from 2.0 a few months ago but well above the pre-pandemic level of 1.2.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Blog-2023-01-06-vacancy-rate-597x800.png))**

> 1.) Elevated Quits

> The JOLTS data also showed that the rate at which workers voluntarily leave their jobs, i.e., the “quit rate,” remains elevated. For private sector workers, the quit rate had been declining over the past six months, but it rose to 3% in November, which is well above the pre-pandemic rate of 2.5-2.6%. This indicates that workers are confident enough to quit their jobs; often for jobs with greater pay – driving up wage growth. The Atlanta Federal Reserve finds that “job switchers” have seen much faster wage growth than “job stayers.”

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Blog-2023-01-06-quit-rate-600x800.png))**

> 1.) Low level of layoffs

> Initial claims for unemployment benefits, which is a leading employment indicator, closed out 2022 at 204,000 – the lowest level since September and a sign that layoffs remain low. Meanwhile, continued claims, which represent the number of unemployed workers who continue to receive benefits, remain steady at around 1.7 million. It has trended higher in recent months, indicating that unemployed workers are finding it a little harder to land a job as hiring slows, but the recent data don’t suggest anything alarming. In fact, the insured unemployment rate is at 1.2%, close to a record low. This measures the number of people currently receiving unemployment insurance benefits as a percentage of the labor force. It is a more useful and timely measure, as there is an observed action, i.e., filing for unemployment benefits, associated with being among the insured unemployed.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Blog-2023-01-06-insured-unemployment-rate-603x800.png))**

> All the above points to a hot job market. Which is great by itself but not what the Fed wants to see. In short, it means the Fed is likely to keep rates higher for longer.

> # But wage growth is easing
> Here’s what is strange but certainly good news: Wage growth is showing signs of declining momentum even as the employment picture remains strong.

> Average hourly earnings for private workers rose at an annualized pace of 3.4% in December, which is only slightly above the pre-pandemic pace of 3.1%. For “production or non-supervisory employees,” wage growth registered just 2.6%, well below the pre-pandemic pace of 3.4%. Non-managerial workers earn less income and tend to spend a greater portion of their income – faster wage growth for this group can potentially put upward pressure on prices. Monthly numbers can be noisy, but even the 3-month wage growth numbers clearly show declining momentum for all workers and for non-managerial workers. We’re yet to get to the pre-pandemic pace, but the trend is positive.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Blog-2023-01-06-wage-growth-600x800.png))**

> Ultimately, the “Goldilocks” scenario is this:

> * Strong employment growth
> * Wage growth eases
> * Inflation falls

> This is not what “theory” says should happen, but it is exactly what we’ve seen recently. We’ll take it. And if it continues, we believe it’ll only be a matter of time before the Fed takes notice.

> # Higher Claims on the Horizon?

> Unfortunately for equities, between a stronger-than-expected ADP payrolls number and stronger-than-expected jobless claims data, today's data showed some strength in the US labor market. Honing in on the weekly claims print, initial claims dropped all the way down to 204K this week. That marked a 19K decline from last week's 2K downwardly revised level of 223K and brings claims to the lowest level since the last week of September when we last saw a sub-200K print. Expectations were calling for the reading to go unchanged from the unrevised level of 225K from last week.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/010523-Claims-1.png))**

> Even continuing claims improved falling to 1.694 million instead of the forecasted increase to 1.728 million. Last week's reading of 1.71 million had been the highest since February 2022 as continuing claims have steadily risen (at a pace consistent with past recessions) in the past several months.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/010523-Claims-2.png))**

> Although both initial and continuing claims had strong showings, there is the caveat that the current period was smack dab in the middle of the holidays. For starters, that could have some impact on the weekly seasonal adjustment, but more importantly, we would note that those are some of the weeks of the year most prone to revisions.

> In the chart below, we show the median revision (expressed as an absolute percent change from the first release) for each week of the year since 1997. The final week of the year has typically experienced a revision of +/-3.8%, tying the week of the July 4th holiday for the largest revision of the year. That means that while claims did show improvement this week, it might not be worth reading too deep into that single number. Further data will be beneficial to help confirm this print (via revisions or lack thereof) as well as provide a clearer picture of the trend, which had been one of deterioration leading into the end of the year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/010523-Claims-3b.png))**

> One other slightly more anecdotal factor worth noting on the stronger-than-expected jobless claims data is that the strong reading this week has gone contrary to the number of layoffs that have made their way into headlines lately. Although the company initially announced the layoffs back in November, Amazon (AMZN) announced today that it plans to lay off a higher number of employees than previously stated (18K versus 10K originally). That also follows an announcement of a significant reduction of roughly 10% of the workforce of Salesforce (CRM) yesterday.

> Over the past few months, news story mentions (in data aggregated from Bloomberg) of things like job cuts, firings, and layoffs have surged reaching a high of 16.5K on a four-week rolling average basis in November (around the time of Amazon's initial announcement). Although that reading has pulled back in the several weeks since then, news counts on the topic remained elevated through the end of 2022 and are likely to get a further bump with this week's headlines. Over the past decade, these story counts have generally followed the path of both initial and continuing claims. More recently, however, there has been somewhat of a divergence with story counts far outpacing actual claims figures.

> That divergence could be for an array of reasons such as workers are quickly finding other roles and not needing to apply for unemployment insurance, but another thing to consider is the timing of the announcement of layoffs versus when they actually happen. For example, in the case of Amazon, while the initial announcement was all the way back in November, those cuts were not planned to go into effect until mid-January. In other words, while not in the data now, higher claims may very well be on the horizon.

> # China Emerges from zero-COVID: What’s Next?

> Happy new year! We’ve officially turned the page to 2023 and hope you and yours had a wonderful holiday season.

> As we closed out 2022, there were numerous major news topics, but one that picked up steam towards the year’s end was China’s assumed reopening after nearly three years of heavy restrictions. There were nationwide protests that started in November over the country’s zero-COVID policy, restrictions, and economic impact. The country started to ease many of the rules put into place. In December, they took a main health code app that tracked travel history offline and overhauled a lot of other limits that had been in place for a long time. This all implied an end to the strict zero-COVID approach.

> With the world’s second-largest economy opening back up, it makes sense to ask…what now?

> Inside China, they’ll have to grapple with rising cases and a health infrastructure that’s probably not as well-equipped to deal with a large outbreak as other Asian nations, like Japan and South Korea. Those countries had lower fatality rates upon reopening. That may not be the case for China, which has had low vaccination and booster rates for the elderly and relied on two domestic vaccines that have been less effective than the ones used by other nations. They’ll have to get better vaccines and import Paxlovid, the anti-viral pill. They’ll also need to increase adoption amongst those who haven’t gotten their jabs.

> Those should help, but there might be an adjustment period. It may take some time before Chinese citizens return to normal. Like in the US, some people may still be reluctant to be out and about with China opening up after nearly three years, but maybe they’ll welcome the reopening flexibility. Travel activity will be watched closely after China’s National Health Commission said there will be no quarantine for inbound travelers starting on January 8th. It may still be a couple of months before activity really takes off (thank you, thank you ).

> Infections could still cause labor shortages and supply chain issues. In place of full lockdowns, they may strongly encourage people who are sick to stay home. With cases rising in the last couple of months in Guangdong Province, which includes the major port city of Guangzhou, there could be supply chain issues in the near term. Tesla’s Shanghai factory was shut down this week with a spike in cases. Ultimately, there could be some starts and stops as the economy adjusts after a really long run of zero-COVID policy.

> Then there will be the 15-day Lunar New Year starting January 22nd, so there will be another slowdown…and hopefully not widespread virus spreading as people leave the cities and head home. That will slow down economic activity and could be another delay to international travel picking up, with Chinese citizens typically going home for the holiday.

> After a few months, this more relaxed approach to the virus should be positive for China, but also more broadly for supply chains to hopefully get closer to pre-pandemic activity levels. But, of course, there are always risks that China decides they need to crack down again.

> The Chinese equity market had a similar run to what was experienced in US stocks. Both sold off for much of the year, and each saw 2022 lows in October. Both saw a weakening in December. That being said, the CSI 300, an index of China’s largest 300 companies, saw a bigger bounce off lows despite the domestic unrest and sold off less in December.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/SP500-and-China-CSI-300.png))**

> There is optimism for Chinese equities in 2023 as the economy gets back to normal, with some economists expecting a quick rebound. While ending the year down, the Q4 rally showed optimism in Chinese stock resiliency as Hong Kong-listed stocks rebounded by over 35% at one point. In the coming months, we’ll see if the optimism is on track or ahead of the economic recovery.

> For us in the US, hopefully, their economy opening up does help supply chains for businesses that have been slow to recover the last 2.5 years after everything ground to a halt. It will be interesting to see what the impact on inflation will be. Reopening means more spending on air travel, which could push prices up. There could also be more demand for raw materials and energy, which could keep inflation higher. We might see some benefit in other areas as supply chain constraints ease, so it very well could be a mixed bag.

> There’s also global concern about the impact of travelers from mainland China. As cases surge, there are limited data shared by Chinese authorities. Starting today (January 5th), the US will require a negative COVID test before departing. Japan is imposing similar measures.

> There will be a lot to watch in the new year. Speaking of, 2023 is the year of the rabbit in China. Chinese astrology says the rabbit is the symbol of patience and luck and follows the tiger, which tends to be more dramatic and tumultuous. Here’s to hoping this rabbit isn’t as frustrating as the ones that ruin my garden every year.

> # Bulls and Bears Back Off

> The S&P 500 has seen some choppy price action heading out of 2022 and into 2023, and that has seemed to have sent shivers down the spines of investors. Only 20.5% of respondents to the weekly sentiment survey run by AAII reported as bullish this week. That is down from 26.5% last week and is just shy of the recent low of 20.3% from two weeks ago.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/010523-AAII-1.png))**

> Although bullish sentiment dropped six percentage points week over week, there was not a shift to bearish sentiment as it also fell from 47.6% down to 42.0%. That is the lowest reading since December 8th.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/010523-AAII-2.png))**

> Given both bullish and bearish sentiment fell by similar amounts, the bull-bear spread moved down to -21.5, slightly below the previous week's reading of -21.1 and extending the record streak of negative bull-bear spread readings to 40 weeks.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/010523-AAII-3.png))**

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/010523-AAII-4.png))**

> With both bullish and bearish sentiment falling, neutral sentiment surged to 37.5% which was the most elevated reading since the last week of March. Additionally, the 11.6 percentage point week-over-week increase was the largest since a 12.6 percentage point surge in July 2018.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/010523-AAII-5.png))**

> Although that may sound like an impressive and notable jump, historically double-digit increases in neutral sentiment in just one week have been followed by somewhat 'meh' returns. Both average and median performance are worse than the norm albeit the index has moved higher more than half the time one month to one year out.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/010523-AAII-8.png))**

> As the AAII survey continues to have an overarching negative tone, the same can be said for other surveys like the Investor's Intelligence and NAAIM readings. Combining all three of these into a composite, this week's reading was roughly 1 standard deviation below its historical average. While that implies sentiment is extremely bearish, that is only in the middle of the past year's range. Additionally, we would note that this composite has been negative (meaning these indicators in aggregate are more bearish than historically normal) for a full year. The only other time period since at least 2006 when that was also the case was in the 54 weeks ending June 2009.

> # Homebuilders Shrugging Off Mixed Data

> The national average for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has come well off its highs falling to 6.6% versus a high of 7.35% in early November. Despite the decline, mortgage rates remain at levels not seen since the early 2000s. We would also note that rates have gone on a series of wild swings in the past year. The second chart below shows the rolling 3-month change since 1998. Whereas most of the year saw rapid increases the likes of which have not been seen in the past quarter century, the current drop of 0.4 percentage points over the past few months has ranked as the largest since late 2020 and is just shy of a bottom decile reading of all periods.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/010423-MBA-1.png))**

> With mortgage rates giving buyers some relief, purchase applications had generally been on the rebound throughout November and December. However, the final week of 2022 saw a large reversal in purchase apps with a 12% week-over-week decline (potentially as a result of residual holiday seasonality) in the largest single-week decline since the last week of September.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/010423-MBA-2b.png))**

> While it is hard to say if the final week of 2022's large decline was seasonal or a return to purchase apps that are more consistent with readings from earlier in the fall, 2022 tended to follow seasonal patterns. The year began with applications around some of the strongest levels of the past decade and they continued to rise into peak housing season in the spring with applications hitting their pinnacle in the first week of May. The typical seasonal drift was then exacerbated by the added headwind of higher rates, and applications finished the year with the worst reading since 2014 for the comparable week of the year. Additionally, looking at the drop for each year from the annual high through 34 weeks later (second chart), 2022's percentage drop was the second largest since 1990 behind only the 75.7% decline in 2013.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/010423-MBA-3.png))**

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/010423-MBA-4.png))**

> Refinance applications have continued to hit new lows as this week saw yet another decline down to the lowest level since May 2000.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/010423-MBA-5.png))**

> Even though there are some silver linings in recent data, housing activity remains weak. Homebuilder stocks continue to look past that though and continue to shrug off much of the broader market choppiness. The past week has seen the homebuilders, proxied by the iShares US Home Construction ETF (ITB), rally 3.25%. That has largely erased the mean reversion from the second half of December and brings the ETF right up to resistance at the mid-August highs.

> # Average Isn’t So Average When It Comes To Investing

> “There was a statistician, and he stuck his head in a bucket of ice and feet in the oven. They asked him how he felt, and he replied, ‘about average.’”

> Old statistics joke.

> First, I wish everyone a happy 2023 and hope you had a great holiday season with family and friends!

> I love using that joke above in a presentation, as it always gets a good laugh. But there is something to it, especially when looking at stock returns. The truth is that average returns aren’t so average, while larger moves happen more than we probably expect.

> If you go back to 1950, the S&P 500 is up 9.1% on average. So let’s say that an average year for an investor is between 8 and 10%. Sounds fair, right? Incredibly, stocks have gained between 8 and 10% only four times (or 5.5% of the time)! The years that hit the average market were 1959, 1965, 2004, and 2016. That’s incredible if you ask me, as I would have assumed we’d have a few more in that average range.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Blog-127.png))**

> This tells us one thing: larger moves are more likely to happen, and the good news is that most of the big moves historically have happened to the upside. This time I looked at all the 20% gains since 1950 and found 20. This comes out to an impressive 27.4% of all years’ gains of at least 20%. I do this for a living, and I point this out each year, but it still somewhat surprises me.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Blog-260.png))**

> What about the negative years? Or, more specifically, the large negative years?

> * There have only been three 20% losses, and those were in 1974, 2002, and 2008. But, of course, last year just barely missed this dubious feat.
> * Five years lost at least 15%, and 12 years lost at least 10%.

> What about 10% moves up or down? 51 years saw stocks either gain or lose at least 10% (39 up and 12 down). That is 69.9%% of all years see a move of greater than 10%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/blog-351.png))**

> As the great Ohio State football coach Woody Hayes once said, “Statistics remind me of the fellow who drowned in a river where the average depth was only three feet.”

> Investors need to take Woody’s advice and remember that averages are important, but there is usually a lot more to the whole story. The bottom line is we could gain between 8 and 10% this year, but the odds favor it’ll likely be a good deal, more or less. I know it is a lonely call, but we are in the camp. It may be more, which we will discuss in our Outlook 2023 next week.

> # January Weaker Last 21 Years

> Recent January weakness can be seen in the chart. January has on average started out positive with DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and 2000 all logging gains in the first half of the month, but weakness then creeps in. From around the seventh trading day to the end of the month declines have prevailed over the last 21 years.

However, recently I’ve noticed that its performance is off by a large margin of what it should be.

NFLX    +1.39%
NVDA  	0.04%
TSLA		3.42%

Total loss/gain: -40%
% of account: 3%

Roth: 
Current value: $33
Total loss/gain: -50.55%
% of account: .35%

Dilemma: you would think I should sell the Roth stock and put into individual since I have less loss, more value, & started buying longer ago. That said, I’ve been reading that you should put individual / high growth potential stocks into an ROTH IRA over an individual account because you pay less taxes on gains.",3,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/102c9gf/trying_to_eliminate_duplicate_holdings_between/

Her picks are just random brands she knows of (Apple, Disney, Nike, Starbucks, Coke, Tyson, Domino’s, Netflix, Google, Marriott, Target, McDonalds, etc…) and usually driven by questions like, “can I buy cheese pizza or dinosaur chicken stock?” And “can I buy YouTube stock?” Or “mom shops at Target” and “I like the vanilla milkshake at Starbucks.”

*****
> Stocks slipped on Friday to end a brutal 2022 with a whimper, as Wall Street wrapped up its worst year since 2008 on a sour note.
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 73.55 points, or 0.22%, to close at 33,147.25. The S&P 500 shed 0.25% to end at 3,839.50. The Nasdaq Composite ticked down 0.11% to 10,466.88.
*****
> Friday marked the final day of trading in what has been a painful year for stocks. All three of the major averages suffered their worst year since 2008 and snapped a three-year win streak. The Dow fared the best of the indexes in 2022, down about 8.8%. The S&P 500 sank 19.4%, and is more than 20% below its record high, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled 33.1%.
*****
> Sticky inflation and aggressive rate hikes from the Federal Reserve battered growth and technology stocks and weighed on investor sentiment throughout the year. Geopolitical concerns and volatile economic data also kept markets on edge.
*****
> “We’ve had everything from Covid problems in China to the invasion of Ukraine. They’ve all been very serious. But for investors, it is what the Fed is doing,” said Art Cashin, director of floor operations for UBS, on CNBC’s “The Exchange.”
*****
> As the calendar turns to a new year, some investors think the pain is far from over. They expect the bear market to persist until a recession hits or the Fed pivots. Some also project stocks will hit new lows before rebounding in the second half of 2023.
*****
> “I would love to tell you that it is going to be like the ‘Wizard of Oz’ and everything is going to be in glorious color in a moment or two. I think we may have a bumpy first quarter, and depending on the Fed it may last a little longer than that,” Cashin said.
*****
> Despite the yearly losses, the Dow and S&P 500 did break three-quarter losing streaks in the final three months of the year. The Nasdaq, however, dominated by the likes of Apple, Tesla and Microsoft, muddled through its fourth consecutive negative quarter for the first time since 2001. All three averages are negative for December, however.
*****
> Communication services was the worst performing sector in the S&P 500 this year, falling more than 40%, followed by consumer discretionary. Energy was the only sector to rise, climbing 59%.

> # One Year's Loss Is Not the Next Year's Gain

> It's finally the last trading day of what has been a tough year for most asset classes, especially equities. As of this writing, the S&P 500 is on pace to finish the year with a 19.83% loss. Over the course of the index's history, there have only been nine other years in which the S&P 500 has fallen at least 15% for the full year. Of course, turning the page of the calendar does not mean all the issues dragging stocks lower magically go away, and a big decline one year does not in and of itself mean we're due for a big gain the next year.

> In the chart below we plot the annual percentage change of the S&P 500 versus its move the following year. Taking a linear regression shows that performance one year is not a good explainer for next-year performance with a miniscule R squared of 0.0003. Looking just at those years where the S&P fell 15%+, five times the index posted gains the next year, while four times the index posted further declines.

> # Let’s Look at Stocks Down Two Years in A Row

> As bad as 2022 has been for investors, there is a silver lining: back-to-back declines in the S&P 500 are rarer than you may think.

> If you go all the way back to 1950, the only times that stocks fell in back-to-back years were during the vicious recession of 1973/1974 and then three years in a row during the tech bubble implosion of the early 2000s. Fortunately, we don’t see similar scenarios within the current environment, so I think the odds could favor a snapback in 2023.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-193.png))**

> Taking a closer look into the data, we found:

> * The year after, a negative return saw the S&P 500 up 15% on average and higher 80% of the time.
> * A 10% (or greater) loss showed the following year up only 8.5% on average and higher 63.6% of the time.
> * Out of the 20 negative years, only three times did returns get worse the following year (in 1974, 2001, and 2002).
> * However, the following year, significant losses were rewarded as 20% or more declines saw the next year higher all three times and up 27.1% on average (in 1975, 2003, and 2009).
> * Somewhat surprising to me is the year after a positive year, the returns were only 7.1% on average and higher 68.6% of the time. Take note that the average year since 1950 gained 9.5% and was higher 71.2% of the time.

> # What Happens When Everyone Agrees That Stocks Will Fall?

> “It’s not what you look at that matters; it’s what you see.” Henry David Thoreau

> I’ve done this for more than two decades, and I have to say, the general consensus remains that the first half of next year will be rough for stocks, while the second half of the year should be better. But let’s be clear, overall, the general consensus is that next year will be rough for investors (as we explained here).

> The last time I can recall everyone agreeing on something like this was in 2012 and the fiscal cliff drama. Seriously, it is all anyone talked about in the second half of 2012, and the big worry was that it would wreak havoc on stocks and the economy in the first half of 2013 and beyond. Guess what happened? Stocks soared nearly 30% in 2013, and the economy did just fine.

> You see, the stock market is always pricing things in, and if everyone is talking about it, you better believe the stock market is aware. As Lou Holtz once said, “Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you respond to it.” We are in the midst of one of the worst years ever for investors, and the general consensus is that next year will be bad, also. So the question is, how are we supposed to respond to this?

> What amazes me is how bearish everyone is. Yet, we have inflation coming down very quickly, an economy (while notably slowing, for sure) that we believe is not likely to be headed to a recession (in part, thanks to a very strong consumer), and some of the historically best times to invest based on the calendar.

> That’s right, the first quarter in a pre-election year has been positive an incredible 17 out of 18 times going back to 1950. Oh, it was also up 7.4% on average (the very best quarter out of the entire four-year Presidential cycle). On top of that, the second quarter has also performed quite well, too. So, we potentially have an interesting situation brewing here, and I sure don’t hear too many people pointing out any of the more optimistic news or perspectives.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/spx-quarterly-returns.png))**

> Now go back to the quote at the very beginning about what you look at versus what you see. To me, I look at all the worries and concerns as everyone else, but what I see is the potential for a surprise rally that not many are expecting.

> # 2022 Solidified as the Worst Year for Sentiment

> As we noted in an earlier post, today's release of the AAII survey gives us the final reading of the year on sentiment, solidifying a number of points as to just how dour the investor outlook has been.

> For starters, the bull-bear spread heavily favors bears, and that has been the case for some time now. As shown below, the spread has been negative (meaning a higher share of respondents are reporting as bearish than bullish) for a record 39 weeks in a row- over a month longer than the previous record which occurred recently in 2020.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122922-AAII-3a.png))**

> Across all weeks in 2022, bullish sentiment averaged a reading of merely 24.73%. Since the survey began in 1987, that is a record low. In fact, the previous lowest readings were a few percentage points higher at 27.29% and 27.08% in 1988 and 1990, respectively. Meanwhile, the average reading on bearish sentiment was historically elevated at a record of 46.2%, surpassing the prior record set in 2008 by one percentage point. Prior to 2008/2009, only 1990 saw a very high average reading for bearish sentiment.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122922-AAII-Year-1.png))**

> As we highlighted in an earlier tweet, given the low readings on bullish sentiment, there was not even a single week this year in which bullish sentiment came in above its historical average of 37.63%. Of course with a low share of survey respondents reporting as bullish, a larger share would be reporting as bearish. To match the impressive reading with no weeks seeing above-average bullish sentiment, nearly every week this year (51) has seen bearish sentiment come in above its historical average of 31%, tying the record high set in 2009.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122922-AAII-Year-3.png))**

> As previously mentioned, bullish sentiment averaged a reading below 25% this year. Given that reading, it should come as no surprise that 2022 also saw a record number of weeks (30) with bulls below 25%. Prior to this year, 1988 (one year after the survey began) was the prior record at 23 weeks. In other words, this year there were nearly two months more in which less than a quarter of investors reported as bullish than the previous record. Additionally, there had been 17 weeks in which over half of the responses were bearish. Similar to the number of weeks in which bearish sentiment was above average, that ties 2008 for the record high.

> # Grinch visits Wall Street on Last Trading Day of Year

> Last-minute tax-loss selling, old sayings such as “year ends make great exits,” a desire to start with a clean slate, who knows exactly the answer, but the last trading day of the year has turned bearish over the last twenty-two years. Since 2000, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have the worst records. On the last trading day of the year, NASDAQ has been down in sixteen of the last twenty-two years after having been up twenty-nine years in a row from 1971 to 1999. DJIA and S&P 500 have also been struggling recently and exhibit a bearish bias over the last twenty-two years. Russell 2000’s record very closely resembles NASDAQ, gains every year from 1979 to 1999 and only six advances since.

> # Country ETFs in 2022

> Earlier today we published our Global Macro Dashboard which provides an overview of the main economic and market data of 22 major global economies. In the table below, we show the recent performance of the ETFs tracking those same countries.

> With 2022 drawing to a close, there are only two countries that are currently in the green for the year: Brazil (EWZ) and Mexico (EWW). Neither are up much, but up is up, especially in a year like this one.

> In terms of month-to-date change, Hong Kong (EWH) has risen the most with a 5.62% gain, while China (MCHI) is up a modest 0.46%. On the other end of the spectrum, Taiwan (EWT) has fallen sharply with an over 20% decline, but most of that drop is actually due to a $5.18/share long-term capital gain that the fund paid out earlier this month.

> # Pre-Election Year Januarys Stellar - #1 S&P 500 and NASDAQ, #2 DJIA

> January has quite a reputation on Wall Street as an influx of cash from yearend bonuses and annual allocations has historically propelled stocks higher. January ranks #1 for NASDAQ (since 1971), but sixth on the S&P 500 and DJIA since 1950. January is the last month of the best three-consecutive-month span and holds a full docket of indicators and seasonalities.

> DJIA and S&P rankings did slip from 2000 to 2022 as both indices suffered losses in thirteen of those twenty-three Januarys with three in a row in: 2008 to 2010, 2014 to 2016 and then again from 2020 to 2022. January 2009 has the dubious honor of being the worst January on record for DJIA (-8.8%) and S&P 500 (-8.6%) since 1901 and 1930 respectively. Covid-19 spoiled January in 2020 & 2021 as DJIA, S&P 500, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 all suffered declines in 2020. In 2021, DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 1000 declined. In 2022, surging inflation, reaching multi-decade highs, stoked fears of substantially higher interest rates in January.

> However, in pre-election years, Januarys have been outright stellar ranking #1 for S&P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000, and Russell 2000 and #2 for DJIA. Average gains range from 3.4% by Russell 1000 to a whopping 6.8% for NASDAQ. DJIA and S&P 500 have only declined twice in pre-election Januarys, 2015 and 2003.

> # Falling FAANG+

> Yesterday Amazon (AMZN) became the third of the mega-cap FAANG+ stocks (along with META and NFLX) to close below its closing low made during the COVID Crash in March 2020. Not only have all of AMZN's post-pandemic gains been erased, but it's now trading below its lowest close made during the COVID Crash!

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/amznchart.png))**

> NYSE's FAANG+ index is described as an index of ""10 of today's highly-traded tech giants."" Given that most of the FAANG+ stocks account for a massive portion of the market cap weighted S&P 500, they are an impactful group. As shown below, the FAANG+ index peaked in early November last year and has dropped 46% since then. The drop more recently follows a failed breakout above the top of its downtrend channel as the index is now back to within 5% of this past November's low. On a relative basis, the group has been underperforming the broader market for even longer with a high in February of last year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122822-FAANG-1.png))**

> Below is a look at the ten FAANG+ stocks. As shown, they came into the year with a combined market cap of $12.3 trillion, and they're ending the year with a combined market cap of just over $7 trillion. While Apple (AAPL) has fallen the least YTD in terms of share price change, it has lost the most in market cap at $844 billion. Amazon (AMZN) has seen its market cap fall the second-most at $843 billion, essentially getting cut in half. Tesla (TSLA), along with AMZN, is one of two names that lost their ""$1 trillion market cap"" club status this year. TSLA is now down 69% on the year, and its market cap has fallen from $1.06 trillion down to just $344 billion. The other FAANG+ stocks that are down 50%+ on the year include Meta (META), NVIDIA (NVDA), Netflix (NFLX), AMD, and Snowflake (SNOW).

> With markets continuing to drop in these final trading days of December, on an absolute basis, 2022 is going to go down as the biggest year of wealth destruction ever for the US equity market. In 2008, the Russell 3,000 saw its market cap fall by $6.7 trillion. As of today, the Russell 3,000's market cap has fallen about $11.2 trillion so far in 2022. $5.2 trillion of that $11.2 trillion decline has come from just the ten FAANG+ stocks shown below.

# **S&P 500 and Nasdaq close higher Friday, but fall for a third straight week - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/22/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)**
*****
> The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rose Friday, but still posted a weekly loss as recession fears continue to batter investor sentiment.
*****
> The S&P 500 rose 0.6% to 3,844.82, while the and Nasdaq Composite added 0.2% to close at 10,497.86. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 176.44 points higher, or 0.5%, to 33,203.93.
*****
> The major indexes oscillated earlier in the session after the core personal consumption expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge of inflation, came in slightly hotter than economists expected on a year-over-year basis, indicating that inflation is sticking despite the Fed’s efforts to fight it.
*****
> “The economic numbers announced today highlight the difficulty for investors today, where weak numbers bring recession fears and strong numbers bring Fed fear,” said Louis Navellier, founder and chief investment officer of growth investing firm Navellier & Associates.
*****
> “You just can’t win right now on macro numbers,” he added. “That is why it’s now much more of a stock-picking market, but with all the index and ETF traders even stocks that are executing their business plan well can get pushed around meaningfully by associated losers.”
*****
> The S&P 500 ended the week down about 0.2% for the week, posting its third straight weekly decline. The Nasdaq Composite, meanwhile, lost 2% for the week, also for the third down week in a row. The Dow was the outperformer, posting a 0.9% gain.
*****
> Recession fears have resurged recently dashing some investors’ hope for a year-end rally and leading to big losses in December. Investors worry that overtightening from central banks worldwide could force the economy into a downturn.
*****
> For December, the S&P 500 has lost 5.8%, while the Dow and Nasdaq have lost more than 4% and 8.5%, respectively. Those are the biggest monthly declines for the major averages since September. Stocks are also on pace for their worst annual performance since 2008.

> # What You Need to Know About the Bank of Japan’s (Unexpected) Monetary Policy Change

> The Bank of Japan (BOJ) made a surprise decision on Tuesday to widen the allowed trading band for 10-year Japanese government bonds (JGBs) from ~25 to ~50 basis points. This move signals a shift in the BOJ’s approach to monetary policy and inflation and is likely to be sustained by the incoming governor of the BOJ.

> For context, Japan has implemented a dovish monetary policy stance for years, with the BOJ’s rates remaining at 0% and large-scale quantitative easing being standard practice. The central bank has targeted a range around zero for the benchmark government bond yield since 2016 and has used this as a tool to keep overall market interest rates low. The policy change could alter the flow of capital from Japan, a major exporter of capital.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/JGB-vs-UST.png))**

> The decision to widen the trading band caused the yen to spike and bond yields to rise. This caught investors off guard, who had expected the BOJ to wait to make changes to its yield curve control until Governor Haruhiko Kuroda steps down in April. The 10-year Japanese government bond yield has spiked to 0.47%, close to the BOJ’s newly set implicit cap.

> # The Largest Buyers of U.S. Treasuries, But for How Long?
> Japanese investors have historically sought investment opportunities outside of Japan, and as of October 2022, they were the largest holders of US Treasuries. The BOJ’s decision can significantly alter this flow of capital, causing Japanese investors to reconsider purchasing US Treasuries. The market is currently pricing in higher Japanese yields and a stronger yen. The rise in Japanese government bond (JGB) yield provides an increased incentive for Japanese investors to keep cash at home amid the global economic slowdown. This has the potential to negatively affect foreign risk assets, as well as strengthen the Yen versus the US Dollar.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Dollar-vs-Yen.png))**

> # A Preview of Things to Come?
> The Bank of Japan’s (BOJ) low-interest rate policy and its consistent purchase of bonds to maintain its yield cap have been criticized for distorting the yield curve, reducing market liquidity, and contributing to the yen’s depreciation, which has increased the cost of importing raw materials. The main question is whether this is a one-time adjustment or if we are getting a preview of what Japan’s new monetary policy approach will be moving forward.

> This unexpected move by the Bank of Japan has the potential to be a headwind to the US Dollar as the Japanese Yen strengthens. We’ll continue to monitor the implications of the hawkish move by the Bank of Japan and be sure to keep you updated along the way.

> # Russell 1,000 Stocks Down the Most from All-Time Highs

> As we wrap up an awful year for the stock market, below we highlight a list of the current Russell 1,000 stocks that are the farthest below their all-time highs. For the index as a whole, the average stock is down 15.85% YTD on a total return basis, while the average stock's price is about 38% below its all-time high.

> About 30% of stocks in the Russell 1,000 are currently at least 50% below their all-time highs, while about 10% of index members are at least 75% below all-time highs. Below we list the 38 stocks that are all down at least 85% from their all-time highs and it includes Palantir's (PLTR) 85.96% drop to Plug Power's (PLUG) near evaporation of 99.2%. Most of these names have come down from all-time highs that were made at some point in 2021, although some like PLUG, AIG, and Citi (C) made highs a long time ago.

> This list is a who's who of stocks that got caught up in the post-COVID retail investor buying spree. A name like Carvana (CVNA) hit its all-time high of $376.69 relatively recently in August of last year. It's at $4.13/share as of this morning. Upstart (UPST) traded above $400/share last October, and it's at $13 and change now. Roku (ROKU) got up to $490.40 last summer and is at $42 now or more than a full decimal point to the left!

> # The Best and Worst Performing Stocks of 2022 (through 12/22)

> Below are lists of the best and worst performing Russell 1,000 stocks year-to-date on a total return basis. We'll start with the worst first. Five stocks in the index are down more than 90% this year: Carvana (CVNA), Opendoor (OPEN), Novavax (NVAX), Upstart (UPST), and Affirm (AFRM). Another eleven are down more than 80%, which includes names like Coinbase (COIN), Twilio (TWLO), Wayfair (W), Lucid (LCID), and Roku (ROKU).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/riydownytd.png))**

> Seventy-two percent of stocks in the Russell 1,000 are down YTD, but below are the names that have bucked the trend and gained the most. Just three stocks are up more than 100% YTD: Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Signify Health (SGFY), and Texas Pacific (TPL). Of the 38 names shown, 23 are from the Energy sector, with big names like Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX), and ConocoPhillips (COP) included. Exxon's 78.8% YTD gain is easily its biggest annual move higher since at least 1980. Merck (MRK) is the biggest of the non-Energy stocks that made the list with a YTD gain of 49.8%.

> # Day After Christmas NASDAQ & Russell 2000 Up 73.5% Of Time

> Santa Claus Rally starts today. The Santa Claus Rally was discovered and named by Yale Hirsch in 1972 and published in our 1973 Stock Trader’s Almanacas the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year. This short, sweet rally is usually good for about 1.3% on the S&P 500, but the real significance of the SCR is as an indicator.

> It is our first seasonal indicator of the year ahead. Years when there was no Santa Claus Rally tended to precede bear markets or times when stocks hit significantly lower prices later in the year. As Yale’s famous line states (2023 Almanac page 118): “If Santa Claus Should Fail To Call, Bears May Come to Broad and Wall.”

> NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have logged the greatest frequency and magnitude of gains on the day after Christmas. Since 1988, NASDAQ has advanced 73.5% of the time with an average move of +0.42%. R2K has also advanced 73.5% of the time with an average advance of +0.40%. DJIA and S&P 500 have slightly softer records, but bullish, nonetheless.

> Two days after Christmas, the market is less bullish with NASDAQ down more often than up. Three days after Christmas R2K small caps take the lead advancing 64.7% of the time with an average gain of +0.46%.

> Looking further out, from 1950-1985 last 5 trading days of the year S&P 500 up 34 of 36 years, average gain 1.24%. 1986-2021 up 19 of 36, average gain 0.43%.

> # Is it Finally Time for The Santa Claus Rally?

> “If Santa should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.”
—Yale Hirsh

> One of the little-known facts about the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) is that it isn’t the entire month of December but is actually only seven days. Discovered in 1972 by Yale Hirsch, creator of the Stock Trader’s Almanac (carried on now by his son Jeff Hirsch), the real SCR is the final five trading days of the year and first two trading days of the following year, not just December. In other words, the official SCR is set to begin tomorrow, Friday, December 23, 2022.

> Historically, it turns out these seven days indeed have been quite jolly, as no seven-day combo is more likely to be higher (up 79.2% of the time), and only two combos have a better average return for the S&P 500 than the 1.33% average return during the official Santa Claus Rally period.

> Here’s a chart we shared recently showing that it is the latter half of December when most of the seasonally strong gains occur.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-255.png))**

> These seven days tend to be in the green, so that is expected. But fun trivia stat, the SCR has been higher the past six years and hasn’t been higher seven years in a row since the ‘70s. The all-time record was an incredible 10-year winning streak in the ‘50s and ‘60s. Here we show all the SCR periods since the tech bubble and how the S&P 500 does after each.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-356.png))**

> The bottom line is that what really matters to investors is when Santa doesn’t come, as Mr. Hirsch noted in the quote at the start of this blog.

> Here we show some recent times investors were given coal during these seven days, and the results after aren’t very good at all. The past five times that the SCR was negative saw January down as well. Then consider when there was no SCR in 2000 and 2008, not the best times for investors, and potentially some major warnings that something wasn’t right. Lastly, the full year was negative in 1994 and 2015 after no Santa. We like to say in the Carson Investment Research team that hope isn’t a strategy, but I’m hoping for some green during the SCR!

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-46.png))**

> Finally, the average gains each year for the S&P 500 is 9.3% and is higher 71.8% of the time. But when there is a SCR, those numbers jump to 10.5% and 73.2%, falling to only 5.0% and 66.7% when there is no Santa. Sure, this is only one indicator, and we suggest following many more indicators to base your investment decisions, but this is clearly something we wouldn’t ignore either.

> # Don’t Lose Faith Yet

> Stocks have sold off hard after the Fed took a more hawkish-than-expected tone last week, which now has stocks looking at one of their worst December returns ever. The good news is that there is still time, and one of the most bullish times of the year is right around the corner.

> We will discuss in more detail the Santa Claus rally tomorrow, as it officially starts on Friday. But today, I’ll do a quick blog with a table that is always very popular.

> As you can see, this table breaks down how each day of the year does. In my opinion, we are amid some of the strongest days of the year, from late December to early January. With stocks quite oversold and sentiment extremely negative, we expect a rally quite soon.

> # No Worse Year for Sentiment

> The past few weeks had been uneventful when it comes to the AAII's weekly reading on investor sentiment. As we noted last week, the three-week range that bullish sentiment occupied had reached a record low hovering between 24.3% and 24.7%. In the latest release, sentiment finally moved but not in the most promising direction. Bullish sentiment dropped 4 percentage points down to 20.3% this week to make for the lowest reading since the end of September.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122222-AAII-1.png))**

> With a decline in neutral sentiment as well, all of the increase went to bears with that reading rising to the highest level and back above 50% for the first time since late October.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122222-AAII-2.png))**

> As a result of the large inverse moves of the two sentiment readings, the bull-bear spread shows a dramatic tilt towards an even more pessimistic bias with bears outnumbering bulls by 32 percentage points. That is the widest spread since the week of October 20th and lower than most of the past decade's range.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122222-AAII-3.png))**

> With yet another week of bears outnumbering bulls, the record streak of negative readings in the bull-bear spread has grown to 38 weeks long; a full month longer than the previous record ending in October 2020. Historically, investor sentiment has acted as a contrarian indicator meaning low readings on optimism have typically been followed by stronger returns for the S&P 500. This time around, sentiment and prices have given each other little reason to turn around.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122222-AAII-5.png))**

> In an earlier post, we noted how there has not even been a single week this year in which bullish sentiment has been above the historical average of 37.6%. Taking another look at just how depressed sentiment has been, the average bullish sentiment reading in 2022 has been less than 25%. The only years that had come close to such a low reading were 1988 (27.29%) and 1990 (27.08%). Playing into that low average has been the fact that there have been a record 30 weeks this year with bullish sentiment coming in below 25%. Meanwhile, bearish sentiment has averaged 46.17% this year, slightly above the previous record of 45.2% in 2008. With bearish sentiment tipping back above 50% once again this week, there have now been 17 weeks with such an elevated reading, tying the record from 2008 with one week to go.

> # Malaise Among Individual Investors

> The misery of 2022 has continued when it comes to investor sentiment. In the latest weekly AAII poll, bullish sentiment declined from 24.3% down to 20.3%. That's the lowest reading since the end of September and less than five points above the YTD low of 15.8% from mid-April.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122222-aaii.png))**

> As shown in the chart above, there hasn't been a single week this year where bullish sentiment has been above its historical average of 37.6%, and the only week where sentiment was even close to its historical average was at the start of the year. With just one week left in the year, barring a historic one-week surge, 2022 will go down as the first year in the history of the AAII survey where there wasn't a single week that bullish sentiment was above average. Talk about malaise.

> # Mega-Caps Down $5 Trillion in Market Cap, AMZN Now Down $1+ Trillion

> As we approach the end of 2022, below is an updated look at the drawdown in market cap that we've seen in the US equity space since major indices peaked on the first trading day of the year. Using the Russell 3,000 as a proxy, the US stock market has seen an $11.7 trillion drawdown from the peak on 1/3/22. The max drawdown was $13.6 trillion at the low on 9/30, so we've seen market cap increase by just under $2 trillion since then. In dollar terms, this drawdown has been more extreme than anything investors have ever experienced. That's pretty deflationary if you ask us!

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/drawdownray.png))**

> Of the $11.7 trillion drawdown in US equity market cap, just over $5 trillion of the drop has come from six companies! Below is a look at the six current and former ""trillion dollar market cap"" club members that have now collectively lost about $5.07 trillion in market cap from their peaks. As shown, Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA) have all lost at least $750 billion in market cap from their highs. And Amazon (AMZN) is the first to lose more than $1 trillion in market cap! Just a few years ago, no company had a market cap of more than a trillion dollars, and now we have a company that has lost more than a trillion dollars in market cap.

> For all six of these companies, their current drawdowns are easily their biggest on record. Apple (AAPL) has lost $880 billion, Alphabet (GOOGL) is down $846 billion, Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA) are both down more than $760 billion, and Microsoft (MSFT) is down $784 billion even though it was down close to a trillion at its lows in November.

GOOG - -17% (105.04 cost basis)

2022-12-13 22:50:22,Amazon,AMZN,"Inflation coming in lighter than expected is likely to be a Bearish indicator, especially in the short term","**Edit:** Down votes are totally fair for this opinion. I was just hoping to get some contrarian views as well. 

For all of 2022, the Fed has been doing their best to increase rates to try and get inflation under control. It looks like we're starting to make some progress as inflation is slowing as seen by today's report and to some degree, the past few reports.

Markets Rejoice!

But not so fast. A reduction in the month to month inflation is great and something that in the long run will be good. But what does inflation coming in below expectations mean for stocks?

A lower rate of inflation means that there are either less than expected dollars chasing the same amount of things, or it could mean there are more things out there with the same amount of dollars. Either way, it means that some or all companies could see less revenue increases or even lower revenue than estimated if we start to see deflation throughout the economy.

If the above happens, we'll start to see the next leg down in the market as earnings compress. I obviously don't have a crystal and can't say for certain it will happen but based on the Fed's actions, I personally think we haven't gotten out of this bear market quite yet.

Here are the reasons why I think we're likely to see that happen next:

1. Real average hourly earnings increased only .5% MoM and are DOWN 1.9% YoY (per the CPI report
2. Food prices rose .5% MoM and are up 10.6% YoY (I would argue this is a good that is not super elastic)
3. Shelter costs are up .6% MoM (again, I would argue this is not a super elastic good)
4. The price of goods like used cars is down 2.9% MoM and services like medical services cost declined .7% MoM.

All that is to say that we're starting to see people making less, spend less on goods and services, while continuing to spend more on goods that they HAVE TO spend on, ie shelter and food; potentially giving them even less disposable income to spend on other things.

Furthermore, from Powell's last FOMC speech, he made it clear that the markets are not fully pricing in how high rate hikes could go and that they are not likely to stop/reduce them anytime soon.

In my opinion, only when we start to see the unemployment rate go up markedly can we assume that the bear market is likely at the end, as the fed stops and reduces rates and companies start to increase their earnings again.

In the mean time, I've been continuing to add tech, especially the big boys such as aapl, amzn, googl, etc. I don't how much further we fall or if we even fall at all but I do think Big Tech is still the way of the future.

With that said, I think whatever recession and earnings decline we see will be mild to moderate as far as stocks are concerned due to many of the big player's strength coming out of covid.

2022-12-13 15:28:33,Amazon,AMZN,Nuclear fusion breakthrough - where and how to invest,"A 70-year-long effort to harness nuclear fusion reactions to generate unlimited clean energy is finally taking shape. For the first time in history, U.S. government scientists have generated more energy from a controlled reaction than it consumed.

The breakthrough was achieved at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory last Tuesday after successfully simulating the solar reactions.

The net energy gain that the experiment achieved paves the way for an abundant supply of reliable, clean, and sustainable alternatives to fossil fuel. If regularly achieved, net energy gains can curb climate change (if not reverse it in the very long term), oil sector-induced inflation can be tamed, and the world can eventually be weaned off its dependence on fossil fuels. (Deep dive: [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/4b6f0fab-66ef-4e33-adec-cfc345589dc7))

# The stock angle

This has been an achievement decades in the making because nuclear fusion has the potential to create energy to power the world without producing carbon or radioactive waste. The road ahead will still be long before this technology becomes commercially viable, but for those in it for the long game, here's a look at how the breakthrough can benefit publicly traded companies like Chevron (**CVX**) and Amazon (**AMZN**). 

>One of the world’s largest energy companies, Chevron, has made several significant investments in the area of clean energy. In this regard, the company started the Chevron Technology Ventures investment fund, which allocates its investments to several low-carbon energy resources. The fund presently has 10 investments in several innovative energy technologies.  
>  
>  
The fund’s investment in Zap Energy, a company that is developing nuclear fusion-related technology, can provide Chevron’s investors significant exposure to this area. Moreover, its investment plans in expanding its hydrogen capabilities also speak of its commitment to improving clean energy.  
>  
>  
Apart from its investments in clean energy, Chevron’s practical capital spending strategies and cost control measures can fuel solid long-term growth. Strong cash flow generating capability allows the company to up its oil production level, reduce its debt, and enhance shareholder value. Chevron is well-positioned to grow in the conventional oil and energy sector as much as it is when clean energy starts getting commercialized.

**Chevron is rated** [HOLD by 12/13 WSJ analysts](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CVX/research-ratings) **and consensus of Overweight**

>At first glance, Amazon seems to be an unusual choice of stock when it comes to the process of nuclear fusion. However, diving deeper, technology is a very intricately interconnected marvel; and being one of the biggest tech giants, very few technological advancements can escape Amazon’s investments.  
>  
>  
Companies dabbling in nuclear fusion directly are looking forward to creating functional reactors in the next few years. Although it’s likely that nuclear fusion technology commercialization won’t happen until the end of the decade, one of the industries that might be among the first to jump on the bandwagon is data centers.  
>  
>  
Data centers run on high amounts of power because of the sheer volume of data that forms the backbone of tech. For that reason, data centers are found in less-populated areas and already have the infrastructure to support new generators; thus ticking two important boxes for placing a nuclear reactor (the phrase “data is the new oil” now makes sense).  
>  
>  
Now, Amazon already has billions invested in its AWS data centers and is continuing to expand its footprint in this market. In this case, it will not come as a surprise if Amazon, given its remarkable resources, adopts nuclear fusion technology to improve its cost efficiency and revenues.

**Amazon has a** [consensus rating of BUY](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMZN/research-ratings) **by WSJ analysts**

> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 49 points, or 0.2%. S&P 500 futures declined 0.3%, and Nasdaq 100 futures slid by 0.5%.
*****
> The S&P 500 rallied 5.9% last week for its best week since June. Investors cheered a lighter-than-expected inflation reading, betting that the Federal Reserve would soon slow its aggressive tightening campaign.
*****
> “A notable shift has occurred in the market, with investors increasingly risk-on across asset classes,” said Mark Hackett, Nationwide’s chief of investment research. “Technical indicators have improved dramatically, with investor sentiment, momentum, breadth, and risk factors all showing notable improvement.”
*****
> The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 8.1% last week for its best week since March, while the blue-chip Dow advanced 4.2%.
*****
> The Cboe Volatility Index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge or the VIX, fell 1 point to 22.5, hitting the lowest level since August. The VIX, which tracks the 30-day implied volatility of the S&P 500, had traded above the 30 point threshold for most of October.
*****
> Still, the Federal Reserve has given little signal that it could deviate from its tightening path anytime soon. Fed Governor Christopher Waller said Sunday that, “We’re at a point we can start thinking maybe of going to a slower pace.” But, “we’re not softening. ... Quit paying attention to the pace and start paying attention to where the endpoint is going to be. Until we get inflation down, that endpoint is still a ways out there.”
*****
> Investors also digested news on the politics front over the weekend. Democrats will keep control of the Senate in the 2022 midterm elections, NBC News projected. The party will hold at least 50 seats after Sens. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada held off challenges.
*****
> Meanwhile, the third-quarter earnings season is set to continue, with a heavy emphasis on retail. Big retailers Walmart, Home Depot, Target, Lowe’s, Macy’s and Kohl’s are all slated to post numbers this week.
