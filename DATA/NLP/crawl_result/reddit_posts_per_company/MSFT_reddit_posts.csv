2025-04-28 22:32:06,Microsoft,MSFT,"Stock market today: Dow, S&P 500 erase slide to rise for 5th straight day in lead up to Big Tech earnings","Stocks closed mixed on Monday but recovered from sharp losses to begin a big week of heavyweight earnings reports and macroeconomic data that will continue to paint an early picture of the US economy's response to President Trump's tariffs.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) erased losses of as much as 1% to rise just above the flatline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) edged up 0.3%, notching its longest win streak of 2025. Both indexes ended in positive territory for the fifth straight day.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell below the flatline, as shares of Big Tech recovered from steep early-session losses.

Wall Street is coming off a rebounding run last week. The gains came as Trump eased pressure on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, and hinted at light at the end of the tunnel for sky-high 145% tariffs on China. On Monday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said it was ""up to China"" to deescalate the trade battle, though he suggested its recent moves to exempt certain US goods from duties represented a positive step.

Earnings are the highlight of the week ahead, with 180 S&P 500 companies expected to report quarterly financial results. Big Tech leads the way, as Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) are all due in the coming days, alongside Coca-Cola (KO), Eli Lilly (LLY), and Chevron (CVX).

Broader economic news will flavor the coming days, as investors eye Wednesday's release of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumer Expenditures (PCE) index, to see the impact of tariffs on the general public's ""core"" expenses. An initial reading on first quarter US GDP is also due Wednesday.

The April jobs report is also in sight, as the labor market has so far remained resistant to signs of economic slowdown.

The April jobs report is also in sight, as the labor market has remained resistant to signs of economic slowdown. Economists expect the US economy added 133,000 nonfarm payroll jobs last month, with the unemployment rate remaining at 4.2%.

The most critical reading may be the non-farm payrolls report on Friday, as the market expects an addition of about 125K jobs.

The goldilocks read may be around 100-150K jobs. We don't want a number that is too strong, as it would likely decrease the probabilities for future rate cuts. At the same time, we don't want a number that is perceived as too weak, as it would imply that the economy may be worsening more rapidly than anticipated, raising recession and other concerns.

I see frequently people post portfolio of SP500 + some individual stock, but that stock is Apple or NVDA. So the question is why would you hold Apple (and similar) and SP500? You are already over exposed to Apple by buying SP500, so why add to the concentration? Wouldn't it be better to invest in a smaller cap name so that you get more diversification (not more concentration) by investing in individual stocks.",14,82,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1k700s8/do_you_worry_about_concentration_risk_of/
2025-04-21 18:26:29,Microsoft,MSFT,"Amazon has paused some data center lease commitments, Wells Fargo says","Amazon has delayed some commitments around new data center leases, Wells Fargo analysts said on Monday, the latest sign that economic concerns may be affecting tech companies’ spending plans.

A week ago, a Microsoft executive said the software company was slowing down or temporarily holding off on advancing early build-outs. Amazon Web Services and Microsoft are the leading providers of cloud infrastructure, and both have ramped up their capital expenditures in recent quarters to meet the demands of the generative artificial intelligence boom.

“Over the weekend, we heard from several industry sources that AWS has paused a portion of its leasing discussions on the colocation side (particularly international ones),” Wells Fargo analysts wrote in a note. They added that “the positioning is similar to what we’ve heard recently from MSFT,” in that both companies are reeling in some new projects but not canceling signed deals.

Tech stocks have been pressured across the board his year as President Donald Trump’s proposals for widespread tariffs raised the prospect for dramatically higher costs on imports of equipment while also threatening to slow the economy. Cloud infrastructure providers have been aggressively announcing plans to collectively spend hundreds of billions of dollars securing Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) and building new data centers.

That was before the announcement on tariffs earlier this month. Microsoft and Amazon both report quarterly results next week. Their stock prices were down on Monday brining Amazon’s decline for the year to 25% and Microsoft’s drop to 15%.

An AWS spokesperson didn’t immediately provide a comment. Earlier this month, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin that he did not see the company cutting down on data center construction.

Wells Fargo has a hold rating on Amazon shares.

2025-04-19 06:17:49,Microsoft,MSFT,This market is really not behaving well. Where do we most likely go from here?,"I think traders and close market analysts realize this more than many people do. From a technical standpoint of course, but a fundamental one.
Fundamental I mean - The concerns that the market was overvalued in the first place... And that trump was going to drop a bomb on the market and dollar itself in some way, shape or form. The foregone conclusion by MSM when the bearish market began in early March that it was just tariffs and trump, or ""still a bull market"" as portrayed by cnbc and then by more MSM once we dropped more than 5 percent. The fact more people than now rely more on retirement appreciation - many times a sign of or near a market top. The talk of depression, parallels to Hoover, Smoot - Hawley, etc. I seriously doubt I honestly was the only one who had my strongest worries since when covid was emerging (but this time feels worse...)

Some concerning features to me are the number of new investors /traders who keep thinking 2020 and 2022 bottoms were like this and now more than ever I'm hearing (accurately ) big drops feel scary, and they always recover. They don't have to always, it's just that they recently have. 

So yeah, I guess that's the question. I don't have a crystal ball of where we are going, but where is it most likely to go? The price action last week was fairly flat-for this market. (down 8 pts on SPY) , but felt genuinely mostly worse than that. Worse case-I fear there will be an added crisis fueled by Trump in the near term or something else internal/ external but important - causing a severe down leg once again. Perhaps that could be poor earnings next week with added economic concerns, Trump firing powell and wrecking the dollar and markets more, or more countries forming ""anti USA"" trade alliances. Best case? Do we move flat in a kangaroo market? Is there significant upside potential if strong earnings come in? I've asked myself the last question a lot, and normally I'd say yes, but now I doubt that, or that the risk/reward will be skewed severely to the downside.

This is kind of the first generalized thing I've felt I could say with any degree of confidence in a while. I could look like a stupid fool a year from now, but maybe not. 

Here's what I've done that's not in any way trading related.  I'm adding to foreign businesses and bonds. For a larger non trading account that can't take heavy risk, that's not my own per se we bought German bonds and more Nokia stock. The bonds are up 5 percent due to the euro, and Nokia is flat. I like Nokia's business as they are not exposed to the tariff nonsense and have big contracts to provide 4g in developing countries still on older networks. This is huge business for them. I'm keeping the Berkshire position, I added to it last year, although I'm a bit surprised by its resilience so far, though I also kept Google (it's doing much worse than I would've expected) but sold two other tech stocks, aapl and Msft. Sold apple when I realized how much Berkshire itself had dumped of apple. Sold Msft because comparably it seemed more expensive and vulnerable in this downturn I thought was likely.



There's a school of thought that says ""markets aren't supposed to make us always feel comfortable"" and that this is why long term holders, ten or more years, will ""always"" or almost always be rewarded as a result. That's generally, but not always been accurate for the past 50 years.
Another consideration:what do you personally feel most of the public feels who have moderate stock exposure? I'm talking like portfolios of $50,000-$500,000. Some of these people may not pay attention to the markets much, but would be overly concerned of a significant market drop. They may just own etfs, or general retail investors. I personally feel many of these people are not overly concerned right now. ",246,289,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1k2psh8/this_market_is_really_not_behaving_well_where_do/
2025-04-18 07:57:08,Microsoft,MSFT,What will be the fate of Semiconductors and Tech?,"So we all saw how much these companies can grow in favourable economic environment. 

What I'm wondering is what will happen in the next months. I assume their revenue growth might slow a bit, but not substantially, at least in the Q1 and Q2 earning reports. Therefore I can hardly understand why the tech and semi companies are falling even harder than the overall market. 

Additionally, the trend is towards more digitalisation, automation, and AI usage, which should all speak for rather more need for such companies, and not less. 

I'm of course aware that the WH is currently an attention seeking drama queen. And that the dot com bubble bursted even though the internet is insanely useful. However, what I don't understand is why the potential on a global scale that Tech and Semi have is being mostly overshadowed by the current market conditions?

2025-04-17 14:35:39,Microsoft,MSFT,How to bet on GOOG GenAI ?,"I’m using various gen AI tools since gpt-2 and stable diffusion. Until last year I was assuming OpenAI and MSFT will be the winner.

Yesterday I just witnessed Google’s breakthrough with image and video generation while tinkering with their new experiment. The more I think, the more the following scenario makes sense:

* Google has unlimited access to YouTube, which gives them edge over others on training video related GenAI

* YouTube has already a proven business model based on user created content with ads or subscription.

* I can see that with GenAI tools from Google, it’ll be possible for people to create “professional” content; short movies, series, animes. Some of them will be hits.

* End game, YouTube will take a big portion from the movie/series market, both watching and also production.

* At some point this might mean big studios and distribution channels (including Netflix) will loose some market to YouTube.

* I expect this to become visible by the end of 2026: A couple of GenAI series, created by a very small team (say 5-10). No actors, just skilled labor.

* I expect the quality and quantity to increase in the next 3-5 years

Based on this outlook, I’m just thinking to simply buy Google stock. But I’m stupid and whenever I buy stock, I loose money. What could I do? Is YouTube important enough for Google that this might boost the stock value?

Hey everyone,

After years of bouncing between trends, missing some massive moves (energy in 2022, early AI), and learning from crashes like 2020 and 2022, I’ve built what I hope is a **macro-resilient, globally balanced, thematic long-term portfolio**.

It’s designed to:

* Withstand **2020-style collapses**
* Endure **2022 inflation + rate shocks**
* Thrive in **AI, robotics, green energy, space, and aging population megacycles**
* Hold through decades — **not just years**

Would love your takes, critiques, and improvements.

# What I’m Trying to Solve

I wanted something that:

* Doesn’t panic-sell when things get ugly
* Still captures long-term megatrends
* Feels like a **real system**, not a Reddit FOMO portfolio

# Looking for Feedback On:

* Am I *too* diversified?
* Should I consolidate some ETFs or lean harder into fewer themes?
* Am I missing any critical macro theme? (nuclear? private credit? Agri?)
* Would you trust this structure to grow for 30+ years with minimal maintenance?

Looking forward to your feedback on this.

[Gold](https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/investing/article/gold-price-today-wednesday-april-16-2025-gold-opens-with-new-high-134956304.html) has surpassed the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks as the most crowded trade on Wall Street as the precious metal surged to record highs this year amid volatile markets and an uncertain economic backdrop.

According to the latest Bank of America fund managers survey published this week, nearly half of the fund managers surveyed (49%) see long gold, or bets that gold prices will rise, as the most crowded trade in the market right now. This marks the first time in two years that fund managers did not see the Magnificent Seven as Wall Street's most crowded trade, according to the survey.

Gold futures ([GC=F](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GC=F/)) on Wednesday rose to an all-time high of $3,334 as investors continued to [favor the safe-haven asset](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-notches-best-week-since-2020-amid-shaken-investor-confidence-in-us-201546983.html) amid a falling US dollar ([DX-Y.NYB](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/DX-Y.NYB/__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!HIhgXKgPRojUSTTqYlaKSTMqCnabU-_BFJYcQNg1l9bJcllZ1Gp3LtN-1O0pcbknpYvKz0DBczt7-zHHf99GDzXJ1VfxDc7wuw$)) and tariff uncertainty.

Gold prices have surged more than 27% year to date, while the Magnificent Seven tech stocks — Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)), Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL), [GOOG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG)), Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)), Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)), Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)), Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)), and Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) — are down considerably.

Tesla stock has led Magnificent Seven losses and is down about 38% since the start of 2025. Apple stock has fallen 21%.

Nvidia stock has also declined 21% year to date. On Wednesday,[ the AI chip giant warned of a multibillion-dollar ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-dives-as-chipmaker-sees-55-billion-hit-from-surprise-china-chip-controls-130319576.html)impact from US export controls on China, which weighed on shares.

Shares of Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon — the remainder of the Magnificent Seven — are all down by double-digit percentages since the start of the year.

Gold's rally comes as [central banks' demand hit all-time highs](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-demand-hits-record-levels-as-central-banks-buy-at-eye-watering-pace-205945413.html) last year and as investors increased inflows into physical gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

""The new highs in gold are signaling a shift in appetite for US assets,"" Ryan McIntyre, senior managing partner at asset manager firm Sprott, recently told Yahoo Finance.

""Confidence in the US has clearly been shaken, so people are looking to diversify.""

Wall Street analysts have remained bullish on gold, [upping their price forecasts ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-keeps-upping-its-bullish-calls-on-gold--heres-why-162732492.html)on the precious metal even amid its fast ascent.

Some 42% of fund managers expect gold will be the best-performing asset of 2025, up from 23% in March, according to Bank of America.

The firm's survey also showed investors have rotated out of US assets by a record amount over the past two months, with 73% of respondents saying ""US exceptionalism"" has peaked.",449,54,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1k0nih7/after_surge_to_record_highs_gold_overtakes/

# Key Takeaways

* Netflix shares jumped Tuesday after a report company executives laid out ambitious targets at a business review meeting last month.
* The streaming giant aims to double its revenue by 2030 and reach a market capitalization of $1 trillion, *The* *Wall Street Journal* reported Monday.
* Netflix is set to report first-quarter results after the market closes Thursday.

Netflix (NLFX) shares jumped Tuesday following a report company executives laid out ambitious targets at a business review meeting last month.

Executives said the streaming giant aims to double the $39 billion in revenue Netflix brought in last year, with a global ad sales target of $9 billion by 2030, *The* *Wall Street Journal* reported Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The streaming giant also aims to reach a [market capitalization](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp) of $1 trillion by 2030, the report said, up from roughly $419.2 billion. The only U.S. companies with a market cap above $1 trillion today include Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B).

Netflix did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Shares were up more than 5% in recent trading Tuesday, leading gains on the S&P 500. They've added about 60% of their value over the past 12 months. (Read *Investopedia's* live coverage of [today's market action here](https://www.investopedia.com/dow-jones-today-04152025-11715325).)

Last week, Morgan Stanley analysts named Netflix a [“top pick,”](https://www.investopedia.com/netflix-a-top-pick-for-morgan-stanley-on-expected-resilience-to-a-weaker-market-11712037) arguing the company could be well-positioned to withstand the current tariff landscape. The streaming giant has shown ""momentum” in its core subscription business, the analysts said. That momentum lowers the company’s overall risk, the bank added, even if the advertising market struggles amid rising trade tensions.

Netflix is [set to report its first-quarter results](https://www.investopedia.com/what-analysts-think-of-netflix-stock-ahead-of-earnings-q1-fy2025-11712295) after the market closes Thursday.",425,166,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jzvy6f/netflix_stock_pops_after_report_streaming_giant/

2025-04-03 18:13:52,Microsoft,MSFT,"Apple sheds $300 billion in tariff-fueled sell-off, on track for worst drop since March 2020","[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-sheds-300-billion-in-tariff-fueled-sell-off-on-track-for-worst-drop-since-march-2020-175727479.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-sheds-300-billion-in-tariff-fueled-sell-off-on-track-for-worst-drop-since-march-2020-175727479.html)

Tech stocks plummeted on Thursday, with Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)) leading ""Magnificent Seven"" names lower following President Trump's[ reciprocal tariff announcement](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-every-country-facing-reciprocal-tariffs-announced-by-trump-on-liberation-day-231329935.html) the day prior.

Shares of Apple, on track for their worst day since March 2020, cratered over 8% in afternoon trade as the stock erased $300 billion from its market cap. The largest risk, according to analysts, centers on the iPhone maker's overseas production hubs, which are particularly vulnerable to the tariffed countries.

On Wednesday, Trump announced tariffs that will impact some 185 countries, including the United States's largest trading partners. Additional reciprocal tariffs, for instance, will include 34% tariffs on Chinese imports, a 20% tariff on European Union imports, a 46% tariff on imports from Vietnam, 32% on imports from Taiwan, and 26% on India — all set to take effect on April 9.

Notably, the additional 34% tax on China will be added to the country's existing 20% tariff, meaning its total tariff rate will rise to 54%. China is Apple's most important [production hub](https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook-apple-supply-chain-trump-tariffs-china-diversify-iphone-2025-1?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=yahoo.com), with about 85% of its iPhones manufactured there.

""Apple produces basically all their iPhones in China, and the question will be around exceptions and exemptions on this tariff policy if those companies are building more operations, factories, and plants in the US[ like Apple announced in February](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-will-spend-more-than-500-billion-usd-in-the-us-over-the-next-four-years/),"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients following the announcement.

As trade tensions escalate, Apple has moved to increase its supply chain beyond just China, boosting manufacturing in places like India and Vietnam. But with the new tariff announcements set to impact those countries too, there's now limited room for reprieve.

""The worry will be around pricing and margin impacts along with what this means for the global supply chain looking forward,"" Ives said. For now, the analyst continues to believe major negotiations will happen over the coming months as companies attempt to navigate ""this new world of tariffs.""

Until then, he warned, ""tech stocks will clearly be under major pressure.""

Other Magnificent Seven players also faced significant selling action. In aggregate, that cohort of stocks is currently on track to eliminate over $800 billion from their collective market caps.

In afternoon trade, Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)) and Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) each fell 7%, followed by a 6% drop in both Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL)) and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)). Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)) dipped 3%, while Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)) was off just under 2%.

Outside of the Mag Seven, chip stocks faced similar declines, despite the exemption of semiconductors from Trump's additional tariffs. Nvidia competitor Broadcom ([AVGO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AVGO)), for example, erased well over $50 billion from its market cap following an 8% drop in shares.

""The implications \[of the announced tariffs\] are broad-reaching, and we see negative implications for the whole \[chip\] sector,"" KeyBanc analyst John Vinh wrote in a note to clients. ""These are most notably going to negatively impact end-demand in key markets including smartphones/iPhones and PCs, as a significant amount of manufacturing is done within China.""

Stacy Rasgon, Bernstein's managing director and senior analyst, added in an interview with Yahoo Finance that the biggest headwind for semiconductors is not necessarily the direct impact of tariffs. Rather, it's the risk of demand destruction as these products become more expensive.

He added, ""The other risk for semis is that they are very cyclical, very global, and very correlated to the macro and to GDP. [So if this tips us into recession, ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-economy-dangerously-vulnerable-to-recession-wall-street-reacts-to-tariff-fallout-155837444.html)that's probably not going to be great.""",213,63,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jqpre5/apple_sheds_300_billion_in_tarifffueled_selloff/

2025-03-28 03:07:37,Microsoft,MSFT,"CoreWeave, the biggest IPO of 2025. (DD on $CRWV)","# I love IPOs.

The last IPO I thought was amazing was ARM (and how far we've come!).  Coreweave (IPOing on the 28th!) is another one I think has a ton of potential. (I wrote the majority of this before the reduced IPO sizing so please forgive me if my math is incorrect).

CoreWeave is a cloud infrastructure provider specializing in GPU computing, called an “AI hyperscaler.” They run data centers full of GPUs and rent out that computing power to customers via the cloud. Similar to AWS/Azure, but they're focused on AI/ML/GPU tasks like making stupid Studio Ghibli pictures of yourself.

CRWV started in 2017 mining ETH but pivoted to being a GPU farm in 2019 after the crash. By 2022, they fully exited crypto mining and doubled down on enterprise GPU cloud services​. This early mover advantage in GPU hosting, (along with all the GPUs they bought from NVDA), have made it a player in the the cloud services space.

CRWV makes money by charging for usage-based cloud compute - clients pay for GPU hours on their servers.​ Initially, they served niches like VFX studios (movies like Interstellar take millions of GPU hours to render), but now AI training and inference workloads are the main growth driver​.

Companies like META/IBM/MSFT have used CRWV for AI compute needs in the past​. CRWV's differentiator is through software- they claim custom scheduling software (e.g. a system called “SUNK” and an optimizer “Tensorizer”) that yields better hardware utilization, faster container spin-ups, and higher throughput than general-purpose which makes them more efficient to use.

In practice, that means a customer training a large ML model might get results faster or cheaper on CRWV than on AWS. CRWV currently operates 32 data centers with 250k+ NVDA GPUs and are very aggressive in acquiring them- they deploy A100, H100, and H200s and are prioritized as customers of NVDA.

**The NVDA Relationship**

NVDA backs CRWV, and they're strong partners (which means they prioritize each other over other customers). Due to this, I dismiss the possibility that CRWV will ever have troubles on the supply side of obtaining GPUs. Something that is fairly common knowledge is that NVDA (and other companies) prefer selling GPUs in bulk because it simplifies customer service and they can charge for enterprise support and  sell thousands at a time. It's also why NVDA spits on the face of their gaming customers.

**Isn't it kind of shady that NVDA both invests and is a customer of CRWV? Why doesn't NVDA use their own chips instead of renting capacity from CRWV?**

Kind of. Nothing they've done is outright illegal (even using their GPUs as collateral is within the law). Even companies that build GPUs need to rent compute when there's a massive amount of demand. MSFT did it, NVDA did it, OpenAI WILL do it. CRWV signed a direct deal with OpenAI: a multi-year commitment up to $11.9 B for GPU cloud capacity​. They have ties to the major AI players. This entire DD going forward assumes that they will continue to keep their relationship with NVDA because NVDA needs them so AWS doesn't swallow the entire market. 

**The Financials**

CRWV has had ridiculous growth- In 2022, they had revenue of $15.8 M (the majority of which came from ETH mining). In 2023, their GPU computing pivot led to revenue of $229M, then $1.9B in 2024. This was obviously fueled by the release of ChatGPT as demand for GPU compute exploded as other companies scrambled to compete with their OWN LLM models.

By 2024, CRWV neared $2 B in annual sales, transforming from a niche player to a major cloud provider in two years.

The financial issue is that CRWV is unprofitable as it scales. In 2023, it lost \~$600M, and in 2024m \~$860M. For every $1 of revenue in 2024, they spent about $1.45 for huge investments in data centers, GPUs, and the associated operating costs (plus interest on debt they've taken out which they have a ton of).

The S-1 shows operating costs close to \~$1B from tech/infra in 2024, which includes data center space, buying/depreciating their GPUs, electricity costs, maintenance staff, etc. The capex is massive and is funded largely by debt.

The cash burn is brutal as well- at the end of 2024 CRWV still has negative FCF (which is normal for a pre-ipo high growth tech startup) and is betting that they will eventually claw their way to profitability despite the brutal looking financials (like Uber, Snowflake, Robinhood, insert your choice of tech startup here lol). The bet is that high upfront investment now will secure long-term contracts and scale to profitability later, like most tech IPOs.

**Customer Concentration**

In 2023, Microsoft accounted for \~35% of CRWV’s revenue​. In 2024, that grew to \~62% of total revenue​. Their S-1 mentioned that close to \~80% of their revenue comes from two customers alone. But this is a warning sign because MSFT wants to build their own (hence their announcement of spending \~$80B in 2025 for AI data centers).

**If MSFT scales back their use of CRWV then they are frankly fucked.** MSFT's CEO also mentioned that using external capacity (like CRWV) for GPUs was a short-term stopgap until their own investment in Azure pays off.

However, the OpenAI deal (remember that OpenAI is 49% owned by MSFT) could take the place of MSFT going forward. The contract is up to $11.9B through 2030​, which averages out to \~$2B/year if used, which is equivalent to all of CRWV's 2024 revenue.  If OpenAI maximizes their usage, CRWV’s revenue could potentially double at minimum if MSFT doesn't pull out. This is a wild hopium optimistic case but I thought it was worth mentioning.

Beyond those two, CRWV has other customers that make up the \~20% of 2024 revenue). These include research labs, VFX studios, and other tech companies but none are individually as large compared to the MSFT/OpenAI. What will make or break this company in the long run is the diversification of the client base because all their eggs are in one basket.

**IPO Technicals**

CRWV sold 37.5M shares at $40/share, getting $1.5B and giving it a $20B valuation. That was below CRWV's official target of offering 49M shares at $47-$55, raising up to $2.7B at $32B valuation​. This signals a lack of interest in the initial offering and is not great news if you already hold the stock, but is excellent if you're a short term trader that wants to see a pop on IPO day- the stock has more room to run. Yes, this means it's good for retail, bad for insiders.

**Valuation/Comparables**

Is a \~$20B valuation reasonable for CRWV? You can do a rough comparison:

|**Company**|Annual Revenue (2024)|**Recent Valuation**|**EV/Revenue Multiple**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**CoreWeave** (CRWV)|$1.92 B|\~$20B (target IPO)|\~10×|
|**Snowflake** (SNOW)|$3.41 B​|\~$52 B (market cap)|\~15× ​|
|**Databricks**\*|\~$3 B by end of 2025|\~$62 B ​|\~20×|
|**AWS** (AMZN)|$107.6 B​|\~$500 B|\~4-5×|

(That's not a typo- AWS is valued at \~$500B, it's the main driver of AMZN's growth, yet struggles to grow because it's already massive). \*Also note that Databricks is a private company

I think that if the company can maintain a hyper-growth trajectory (e.g. 2-3× growth for a couple more years), then an 10× multiple now could look cheap in hindsight. For instance, 2025 revenue could hit \~$4 B+ with the OpenAI ramp and other clients. Of course, we have risks like growth decelerating, and tariffs and Trump and China that could come in and decimate growth. And of course, they're not profitable (for now). Ironically, CRWV and other US firms would BENEFIT from chip restrictions because they'd be prioritized over the overseas ones that use NVDA chips.

CRWV’s valuation is aggressive (dare I say fair for a hyperscaler), but in line  with other cloud providers. The entire short term bull thesis depends on them retaining MSFT as a customer and also keeping OpenAI- if that occurs then investing in it now looks like a no-brainer. If not, **it's completely possible we see an 50%+ selloff. I think that's the reason why we're seeing such hesitancy in this valuation.**

This valuation is also dependent on entirely dependent on AI spending GROWING, society seeing greater integration in AI (more than we have now), and AI firms willing to continue spending on compute they can't harness themselves. We are still supply constrained on GPUs in general, and if we ever experience NVDA building more GPUs than there is demand for, then Coreweave's margins are threatened and profitability can vanish. For now, it looks like that is unlikely to happen.

**IPO Trading Details**

37.5M shares is decent IPO volume so I don't expect this to be illiquid when it trades. The main things I watch for are indication price (whether there are people who want to buy the print of the stock higher than what we IPO at) and share paired (which somewhat signal when the IPO will open for trading).

Overall, this is a pure AI play on GPU compute, a bet that demand for GPUs will continue to outstrip supply,  and that MSFT/OpenAI/every other tech firm involved won't slit their throat in in the eternal game of thrones that is capitalism.

**TL;DR:** There's a hell of a lot of risk, but I like the stock. It's completely possible it could open and sell off because the insiders just want to bail. It's possible that it skyrockets. Anything is possible in the wild and crazy world of IPO trading.

2025-03-25 22:14:10,Microsoft,MSFT,Stocks Close Higher for 3rd Straight Day; Tesla Surges in Late Trading to Extend Rally,"
Major indexes closed slightly higher Tuesday as the stock market continued its recovery from an extended selloff.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite added 0.2% and 0.5%, respectively, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose fractionally. Stocks had kicked off the week with big gains following news that President Trump could scale back some of the tariffs that are due to be imposed next week on U.S. trading partners. With the recent gains, the Dow has inched back into positive territory for 2025, as stocks have rebounded from a month-long selloff spurred by concerns about the potential impact of tariffs and uncertainty about the outlook for the economy.

Investors brushed off consumer confidence data released this morning that came in weaker than expected, with the index hitting its lowest level in more than four years. Investors are closing watching all data points amid worries that tariffs could reignite inflation and cause economic growth to stall. The big economic report of the week comes Friday with the scheduled release of the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which had fallen during the recent stock market rout amid the growing concerns about the economy, was at 4.32% in late trading, down from 4.33% at yesterday's close and from an earlier high Tuesday of 4.37%. The yield, which affects costs on all sorts of loans, notably mortgages, hit its highest level in more than a month this morning.

Mega-cap technology stocks, which helped lead Monday's rally, were mostly higher again today. Shares of Tesla (TSLA) rallied late in the day to finish 3.5% higher, gaining ground for the 5th consecutive session, despite news Tuesday that the EV maker's sales in Europe continued to slide. Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta Platforms (META) each rose more than 1%, while Microsoft (MSFT) inched ahead. Chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) closed slightly lower

2025-03-21 00:54:15,Microsoft,MSFT,Short sellers have made $15 billion betting against Tesla and Nvidia in 2025,"Short sellers have been cleaning up to start 2025 amid a massive sell-off in some of the market's most popular names over the past two years.

Short sellers have made a combined $15 billion betting against Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) stock thus far this year, according to data from S3 Partners. Tesla shorts alone have raked in nearly $11 billion, while bets against Nvidia have brought in more than $4 billion.

Tesla's 40% year-to-date drop has led the declines of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks. Investors have grown concerned about CEO Elon Musk's focus on government efficiency efforts and how his role with President Trump's administration could be a turnoff to the electric vehicle maker's customer base.

But it hasn't just been Tesla lagging. As an index, the Magnificent Seven — which also includes Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) — is underperforming the S&P 500 this quarter by the most since 2022.

Short sellers have profited off of all of the names in the cohort this year. They've brought in nearly $5 billion betting against Apple stock, which is down nearly 14% in 2025.

The crash in the most popular trade of the past two years comes as investors have been re-rating their growth expectations. Fears of slowing economic growth and the impact of Trump's tariff policies have weighed on markets. Meanwhile, Big Tech has faced growing investor criticism about its ballooning AI spend and whether or not it will eventually boost future profits as much as Wall Street hopes. The year also included a massive drawdown in some large tech names, including Nvidia, following the release of a cheaper AI model from Chinese company DeepSeek.

Now, with most of the names sitting around 20% off their recent 52-week highs, the looming question for markets is whether or not investor appetite for the stocks that led the market higher for the past two years will return.

""Maybe these tech stocks got ahead of their skis a little bit,"" BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski told Yahoo Finance last week.

2025-03-11 17:12:13,Microsoft,MSFT,Trump's DOJ wants a Google breakup but is willing to leave AI alone,"President Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, now largely agree on a major point that has the potential to reshape the tech world: Google should be broken up.

But there is an important difference that emerged in a filing last Friday: Trump’s Justice Department wants to let Google (GOOG, GOOGL) keep its investments in artificial intelligence. It notably has a stake in OpenAI rival Anthropic worth billions.

Backing off the Biden administration's request to force Google to sell off its AI bets was ""significant"" and ""very justified,"" said Mark McCareins, a business law professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management.

It ""may be an indication that the government worries about deterring AI advances in the global race with China,"" added David Olson, associate law professor at Boston College Law School.

The stock of Google's parent, Alphabet, dropped more than 4% Monday as other tech stocks also sold off on macroeconomic concerns.

The final decision on what happens to Google's $2 trillion empire in court will be in the hands of federal judge Amit Mehta, who ruled last August that Google illegally monopolized online markets for ""general search"" and ""general search text.”

No matter what Mehta decides, Google is expected to appeal, and the DOJ can too. Hearings to decide on remedies in this case are slated for April and May.

Final remedy recommendations from the government and Google were due to the judge Friday, giving a Trump-led DOJ one last chance to alter the prior Biden-era suggestion to the judge that Google be broken up with the forced sale of Google’s Chrome browser or contingent sale of its Android operating system.

It didn’t do so, despite being lobbied by the company to reconsider the Chrome proposal on national security concerns.

""Google must divest the Chrome browser — an important search access point,"" the DOJ stated in its final proposal on Friday.

It argued that under a different owner, new rivals would have an “opportunity to operate a significant gateway to search the internet, free of Google’s monopoly control.”

They also retained part of a request to leave the door open to a possible divestiture of Google's Android operating system.

But prosecutors did drop the Biden DOJ's push for Google to sell off its AI bets, instead suggesting a setup where federal authorities could keep tabs on proposed AI investments that could threaten search competition.

Anthropic has argued to the judge that forcing Google to relinquish its stake would tilt the AI playing field in favor of OpenAI and its backer, Microsoft (MSFT).

“Plaintiffs no longer seek the mandatory divestiture of Google’s AI investments,” the DOJ said Friday in its revised proposal.

Derek Mountford, a shareholder in Gunster's business litigation practice group who specializes in antitrust litigation, said while the Trump administration's AI rollback is a concession, it comes with a hook.

""They're asking for some reporting requirements to be attached to it,"" he said.

""I think one of the [antitrust] themes you might see in a second Trump administration is even if they're walking back some of the proposed sanctions, there's still that element of control and monitoring and enforcement that's going on in the background.""

The tension for the Trump administration, Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich told Yahoo Finance last week, is that it is engaged in an existential fight with China for the future of AI and Google can still be an important weapon for the US.

""What are we going to do, hobble one of our main US runners in that race by breaking up that company?” asked Kovacevich, who previously led Google's US policy strategy and external affairs team.

""It seems ill-timed to do that.""

The DOJ did stick with another expected remedy proposal that strikes at a major contention in the case.

It asked the judge to block Google from contracts that secure its search engine as the default across dozens of internet-connected devices, such as mobile phones made by Apple (AAPL), Samsung, and others, and browsers, including Apple’s Safari and Mozilla’s Firefox.

That is not good news for Apple, jeopardizing a major revenue stream. In 2021, Google paid $26 billion for default search placements, and the lion's share of that went to Apple.

Bernstein analysts have estimated Apple’s revenue from Google Search defaults is somewhere between $18 billion and $20 billion per year.

Google countered the DOJ’s request on Friday by asking that it still be free to enter into contracts to make Google search a default — so long as it does not condition search licensing based on device manufacturers also agreeing to distribute, preload, place, display, use, or license its AI Gemini Assistant Application.

McCareins, the law professor at Kellogg, said the DOJ has little to lose at this stage by holding on to Chrome divestment as a negotiating chip, given that both the underlying case and the judge's decision on remedies are subject to appeal.

""Just from a bargaining negotiating position, at this stage of the proceedings, I am not shocked or stunned that the new sheriffs in town have continued to argue for divestiture of Chrome,"" McCareins said.

2025-03-04 14:34:03,Microsoft,MSFT,"Microsoft data center leases slowing, analysts say, raising investor attention","Feb 24 (Reuters) - An analyst note flagging a possible slowdown by Microsoft [(MSFT.O), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/MSFT.O) in leasing data center capacity grabbed the market's attention on Monday, lending credence to skepticism among investors worried that the AI-led stock-market boom might be running out of steam.

TD Cowen analysts in a note Friday said the tech giant had scrapped leases for sizeable data center capacity in the United States, suggesting potential oversupply as it builds out artificial intelligence infrastructure.The brokerage, citing its supply chain checks, said Microsoft has canceled leases totaling ""a couple of hundred megawatts"" of capacity with at least two private data-center operators, the analysts led by Michael Elias said.Microsoft's plan to invest over $80 billion in AI and cloud capacity this fiscal year remains on track, a company spokesperson said. ""While we may strategically pace or adjust our infrastructure in some areas, we will continue to grow strongly in all regions,"" the spokesperson added.While Microsoft shares were little affected - the stock lost 1% on Monday - related companies took a hit. Shares of German firm Siemens Energy [(ENR1n.DE), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/ENR1n.DE) and French company Schneider Electric [(SCHN.PA), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/SCHN.PA) fell 7% and 4%, respectively.U.S. utility companies Constellation Energy [(CEG.O), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/CEG.O) and Vistra [(VST.N), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/VST.N), which provide power for data centers, lost 5.9% and 5.1%, respectively. Tech bellwethers were lower as part of a broader Nasdaq selloff.Investor skepticism over the billions that U.S. tech firms have channeled into AI infrastructure has grown due to slow payoffs and breakthroughs at Chinese startup DeepSeek, which showcased AI tech at a much lower cost than its Western [rivals.Microsoft](http://rivals.Microsoft) had also paused converting statement of qualifications, or precursors to formal leases, TD Cowen analysts said, adding that other tech firms including Meta Platforms [(META.O), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/META.O) had previously made similar moves to lower capital spending.""I don't construe it as any change up in the big macro picture. 

Their desire is to build out these data centers,"" said Dan Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust, which owns shares in Microsoft.Any lease cancellations would mark a sharp shift for Microsoft, which has been spending billions of dollars on data centers to overcome supply bottlenecks that have limited its ability to meet AI demand.The news could possibly indicate lower demand, Bernstein analyst Mark Moelder said, especially after lackluster quarterly results from major cloud companies, but it was also reflective of the capacity build-up at Microsoft in the past years.""Microsoft needed to meet demand and had a great deal of difficulty finding capacity. Management may, therefore, have rented, even at a meaningful premium, data centers and GPU capacity and negotiated more deals for additional future capacity than they needed,"" Moelder added.

2025-02-28 14:47:56,Microsoft,MSFT,Skype to Shut 14 Years After Microsoft’s $8.5 Billion Purchase,">Microsoft Corp. is signaling the end of the line for Skype, the iconic internet calling and chat service it bought almost 14 years ago.

>Once a byword for digital calls that bypassed long-distance charges, Skype was surpassed in recent years by smartphone-native communication apps and Zoom video calls. When Microsoft tried to stretch the Skype brand into the workplace, it lost out to Slack Technologies Inc.

>Microsoft’s response was to start from scratch and build Teams, a chat, voice and video communication service for the workplace, which gained ground as part of its software bundle. The Redmond, Washington-based company will offer Skype users the option of migrating to Teams, which is now its strongest rival to Salesforce Inc.-owned Slack, before it shuts down in May.

>“I’ve been at Microsoft for over 30 years, and there’s a lot of software that we’ve done that was incredibly valuable in its era, and then the next era came and it was the foundation,” said Jeff Teper, a Microsoft president who oversees communications and collaboration tools.

>Microsoft said there were more than 300 million monthly Skype users in 2016, but its daily user count had dwindled to 36 million in 2023. Teams, by comparison, has risen to 320 million monthly users.

>Founded in 2003 by Nordic entrepreneurs, Skype at one time was owned by eBay Inc. and was in the hands of a private equity-led consortium when Steve Ballmer came knocking. The then-Microsoft boss made an uncharacteristically splashy bet on the market leader in online calls, paying $8.5 billion, a 40% premium to Skype’s internal valuation. The May 2011 deal was the largest acquisition by Microsoft at the time, and Skype became a key piece of its strategy for the emerging mobile age.

>It didn’t pan out as Ballmer would have hoped. Upstarts like Telegram, Snapchat, WeChat and WhatsApp solved problems that Skype didn’t. Microsoft’s center of gravity in corporate software ultimately ensnared Skype, which found itself in the Office division and under orders to build tools geared toward a workplace audience as well as a consumer one.

>By the time Slack arrived on the scene, Skype users were complaining that elements of the core experience had started to break down. They cited missed or phantom calls and failures to sync information on different devices. The company worked to improve the service’s reliability, but some loyal users were put off by frequent redesigns, including a short-lived effort to fashion Skype in the mold of Snapchat.

>Microsoft, which also saw its acquisition of Nokia Oyj’s mobile phone business end in failure, is far from alone in encountering rejection by a fickle consumer market. Alphabet Inc.’s Google has cycled through several iterations and brands for its online communications tools, which are today known as Chat and Meet. And this month, Amazon.com Inc. said it would be winding down Chime, the video and voice calling service it tried with little success to sell to corporate clients.

>The Windows maker is shuttering Skype to focus on developing new features for Teams, including artificial intelligence tools, Teper said. The company is working to infuse AI into its product suite, while keeping a lid on spending that isn’t part of that effort. It’s reassigning staff that had worked on Skype to other areas of the business and will not lay anyone off, Teper added.

>At one point, Skype played host to one of Microsoft’s biggest AI demonstrations: a real-time translator. Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella had nudged researchers to bring the product to market as quickly as possible and heralded it as “magical” in a 2014 demonstration early on in his tenure.

>Teams is “going well and this is a step to double down on it,” Teper said, adding that Microsoft wanted to keep Skype running until it was confident that the Teams version for individual users was fully ready. “It’s the most successful product in its category by far,” he said.

**My Take:** Thank god. ZM might stand to be a major benefactor from this. MSFT already has Teams that serves as a workplace call tool, but Skype has tried to expand into the workplace forum space (like Slack) and has failed. MSFT is citing this more as a doubling-down on Teams rather than admitting ZM has eaten their lunch here.",2654,299,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j09c5p/skype_to_shut_14_years_after_microsofts_85/

Palantir has been on a tear recently, all hyped up on the defense sector growth but no one is really paying attention to Meta Defense and their entry to the space. Last year Meta opened up its AI models to defense agencies and contractors. This is huge for them to get this level of clearance and i think this will will put them in direct competition with Palantir. Im not sure how they build out this branch of Meta, Im calling it Meta Defense but they fired all their woke people and are starting to re-shape the company.

Yes, there is defense spending cuts but its all on waste and overcharged contracts not on things that actually matter for the dept of defense. During the inauguration Zuckerberg was in the front row, Hegseth was somewhere in the back. Just an observation.

2025-02-06 04:06:11,Microsoft,MSFT,Intel's next CEO could be Dr. Thomas Caulfield. Intel to merge with GlobalFoundries?,"INTC is green on the day, which is extremely suspect given it's priced as a company with no moat, no product, no foundries, 50B in debt and no CEO.

Let's start with addressing the rumors.

* GlobalFoundries announced that [their CEO is stepping down in May](https://gf.com/gf-press-release/globalfoundries-announces-leadership-transition-to-drive-next-phase-of-growth/). He is to stay on as Executive Chairman.
* A January Bloomberg report ([paywall](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-17/biden-s-chips-team-hands-off-52-billion-program-to-a-skeptical-trump)) suggests the two companies are considering a merger, but that the US won't allow it unless the UAE government gives up their 80% controlling stake in GF.
* Dr. Thomas Caulfield is replacing Ahmed Yahia, which was installed by the UAE government just after the purchase to control their 80% interest. Why would they let go of their man unless they were getting ready to divest?
* Company jets for GF, QCOM, INTC and Musk were all at Mar-a-Lago (source: dylan522p (SemiAnalysis) on X, which I can't link) just after the SemiAccurate article ""[Sources Say Intel Is An Acquisition Target](https://www.semiaccurate.com/2025/01/17/sources-say-intel-is-an-acquisition-target/)"".
* Someone bought [$170M worth of INTC stock](https://i.imgur.com/LHzDkgp.png) yesterday after market, which is about the same number as Pat's performance-based compensation when he joined in 2021. (INTC's board might not want to surrender shares from their treasury at this price).
* INTC and GF are both critical suppliers. In the words of CSIS: [Too Good to Lose: America’s Stake in Intel](https://www.csis.org/analysis/too-good-lose-americas-stake-intel). (CSIS also has an amazing YouTube channel for policy discussions).

Now for why everyone is wrong in thinking Intel is a bad company:

* Their gamble to regain process superiority by developing five technology nodes in four years is paying off. Intel 3 is in HVM and 18A will by the end of the year. Yields are looking good and they even signed up Microsoft as a customer (meaning, some of that $80B MSFT capex for OpenAI inference is likely to go to 18A).
* 18A is not only competitive, but market leading. TSMC doesn't have an answer to Intel's backside power delivery, and lower impedance = lower losses.
* If you thought 18A was cool, wait until you learn about 14A. 18A is the stepping stone for the real high-volume money maker, 14A.
* 14A is going to be manufactured on NA EUV machines, which TSMC doesn't even have. Again, Intel bought all of them for last year.
* On the product side, we know from the current Lunar Lake CPUs (manufactured on TSMC 3N, a worse node than 18A), that is has [nothing to envy to AMD's offerings](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/lunar-lake-allegedly-smokes-z1-extreme-handheld-gaming-champ-in-early-gaming-benchmarks).

The last point is, of course, tariffs, promised to be between 25% and 100%, to incentivize onshoring of chip manufacturing. They might be announced and not implemented for at least a year, to give time to the market to move to 18A/14A, but they are going to happen, as it's perfectly reasonable policy (have you seen those Chinese landing ships?).

A lot of this content was taken from the r/intelstock subreddit, which I hope the mods are ok with me linking!

2025-02-05 18:54:07,Microsoft,MSFT,Thinking about NVDA beyond 2025 Hyperscaler CapEx Growth,"With 3/4 hyperscalers reporting earnings already, the reaction to Nvidia has been positive, but stock still trades less than before DeepSeek. I believe the sentiment is that while 2025 will be great, Nvidia is nearing the ""end of great times"" and moving to a ""just good times"".

**Here's my take at a breakdown. I am not an expert, but have read a lot of positive and negative takes, I'm starting this thread to start a discussion not to pump the stock. Please don't comment ""Nvidia diamond hands durr"".** I didn't use AI to write this sadly.

I can't link out to some of the resources, but tried to describe them for easy search and find.

**TLDR:** Meeting 2025 revenue projections isn't at excessive risk based on CapEx raises so far. It's likely that production capacity may really be the limiting reagent for 2025 revenues not demand. Market is forward looking and there is uncertainity on 2026+ revenues (DeepSeek is one of them) - markets don't like that. However, uncertainity is an opportunity if Nvidia can deliver again - remember stocks climb a wall of worry.

**Disclosure:** Own a lot of NVDA. But have covered calls on them, so not a blindfold risktaker.

**Personal take:** NVDA is attractive at these levels, but I'd be cautious holding my entire position after the summer 2025 earnings calls from the hyperscalers, because if there's any indication there is a 2026 CapEx slowdown, stock could fall a lot. I can't predict the future, so diversification is important even if you like the stock.

However, continued chip innovation that maintains a competitive advantage that leads to higher end customer ROIs compared to other chip alternatives would help. Also, release of one tangible AI product would change the sentiment and game here (e.g. Robotaxis, enterprise solutions used common place for F500 companies, etc). Many are already underway - my company is releasing Gemini for all employees - this goes beyond software engineers. I think diversification across the industry (AVGO, TSM, power producers) could be valuable as time progresses as the AI use case boom happens.

\-----------------------------------------

**(1) Meeting 2025 Revenue projections isn't at excessive risk based on CapEx raises so far**

Based on [stockanalysis](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/nvda/forecast/) consensus 2024 to 2025 revenue growth is estimated to be 52%.

1. MSFT: 55.7B in 2024 to 80B in 2025
2. Google: 52.5B in 2024 to 75B in 2025
3. Meta: 39B in 2024 to 60B - 60B in 2025

Based on the numbers written above, the anticipated growth from hyperscaler capex spend is 46% (if we assume concentration of NVDA chip spend as percent of capex steady). Hyperscalers are estimated to be about 50% of Nvidia revenue. To reach the 52% target that means from the remainder of the revenue book, Nvidia needs 58% spend increase.

This doesn't seem unreasonable. **Potential** investments through StarGate (Oracle), OpenAI's increasingly independent spending funded by Softbank, and sovereign AI investments are a tailwind to that figure. However, sustained export controls (e.g. Biden's global export framework) and increased crackdowns are headwinds.

**(2) It's likely that production capacity may really be the limiting reagent for 2025 revenues not demand**

Based on multiple [sources](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidias-blackwell-gpus-are-sold-out-for-the-next-12-months-chipmaker-to-gain-market-share-in-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com), seems like Blackweel is sold out for the next 12 months anyways. So 2025 revenues may be a matter of strong production. Moreover, from the commentary that google had on their earnings call - seems like cloud growth is supply constrained by infrastructure rather than demand constrained. I believe for 2025 at least customers will buy as many NVIDIA chips as they can and its production that determines valuation.

Since the market is forward looking, 2025 revenue misses won't be as crucial as addressing the question of when is the demand going to slow down and the AI semiconductor sales from NVDA slowdown?

**(3) Market is forward looking and there is uncertainity on 2026+ revenues (DeepSeek is one of them)..markets don't like that**

No matter how you slice it, DeepSeek has provided true software driven advances that more efficiently use Nvidia GPUs and non-NVDA GPUs on the training and particularly inference level. You can look at the cost per inference token for DeepSeek vs. OpenAI. It has raised questions on the sustainability on needing cutting edge chips at high margins in the long run. Risks below.

* **Do closed loop models even have a moat over open source?**: Can closed-loop/proprietary LLMs develop models that demand a strong ROI justifying investment in more chips to **train** better models that **end users are willing to pay for**? Currently Sam Altman & Dario (Antropic) think compute is the way to go. However, at some point they could discover more compute for training =/= better or more efficient models.
* **Training:** Efficiencies in hardware utilization may reduce Nvidia's moat in interconnectivity and lead to better training advances, which could reduce margins if other chips are ""somewhat as good"" eventually given demand equalizes to supply. See point # 1 in this excellent recap here  (available by searching DeepSeek and the ramification on the AI industry: winners and losers? by Rihard Jarc)
* **More use cases in a post training world could mean more inference on custom chips & competitor products:** It is widely believed that Nvidia is more of an undisputed leader in training performance vs. inference. If open source models become good enough and training investments do not result in monetizable ROI, Nvidia's margins likely fall as custom chips and other semiconductor players provide good solutions. [Jevon's Paradox (more use cases and usage)](https://www.npr.org/sections/planet-money/2025/02/04/g-s1-46018/ai-deepseek-economics-jevons-paradox) is very likely here, but volume would have to increase signficantly to offset margin decreases - a risk that the market doesn't like.
* **CUDA alternatives leads to market share loses?:** CUDA is widely known to be the best option ""coding"" platform to get GPUs to do what you want right now. [However, there are other applications coming out that allow fungible usage of other chips. ](https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/17/nvidia_cuda_moat/#:~:text=If%20you're%20doing%20low,AMD%20hardware%20%E2%80%93%20and%20vice%20versa)This reduces the need to use Nvidia chips and pay such high margins. There's drawbacks to not using CUDA that I'll highlight in section 4.

Sidenote - there is an honest and excellent podcast on DeepSeek implications to Nvidia from Bankless w/ Jeffrey Emmanuel (whose blogpost got a lot of investors interested in DeepSeek impact over 2 weekends ago). Please listen.

**(4) However, uncertainity is an opportunity if Nvidia can deliver again - remember stocks climb a wall of worry.**

* **Early innings of the AI story:** Models are going to get more complex not stagnate. This requires more training compute as we try to reach AGI level models. On the inference front, as more use cases explode, there will be more general chip demand. We haven't even seen full released use cases in robotics, autonomous transit, healthcare AI, etc.
* **CUDA is the lowest latency** and provides best performance as of now. There might be a technical limit to how well alternatives perform.
* **Cost of being last** in AI is too great for hyperscalers
* **Continued innovation leadership:** Nvidia has expedited it's semiconductor cycle from 2 years to 1 year. Rubin (next gen AI chips) are already being worked on. Semiconductors are known to be cylical, but this may dull any trough cycle.
* **Increased soverign AI investments** (StarGate, Middle east, etc.)
* **Ridiculous cash flow with minimal R&D** as % of revenue means that Nvidia can invest in strategic ventures, emerging tech, and adjacent spaces to diversify revenue streams. Not sure this is proven out in the financials yet, but could in the future.
* **Hopefully - reduced interest rates boosts stock valuations**.

News: [Trump Tariffs Push Us Manufacturers To Rush To Beat Mexico Canada Fees](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-05/trump-tariffs-push-us-manufacturers-to-rush-to-beat-mexico-canada-fees)

**Ticker:** [**AMD (Advanced Micro Devices)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMD&p=d)

**Catalyst:** AMD reported EPS of $0.29 vs. $0.41 expected. Revenue of $7.66 billion vs. $7.5 billion expected. Ultimately said that data center segment revw will be down in Q1, but had clear positive outlook in 2025 and expected double digit revenue growth. This was what caused the stock to fall despite the initial spike.

**Technicals:** Watching $100 level, but doesn't seem to be an irrational move in my opinion. Note that we've moved from $150 to $107 in the past 3 months.

**Risks:** The vast majority of NVDA/AMD/every semiconductor's business's money comes from selling to businesses- individual consumers are a tiny slice of the pie despite gaming/client businesses growing, so I don't really pay attention to them (one exception is NVDA'S 50 series GPUs selling out within 5 minutes) . We also have threats from NVDA dominance, possible regulations from the US, etc, (Disclaimer: I generally don't invest in AMD)

**Related Tickers:** NVDA, INTC, QCOM

**Offhand Comments:** Overall doesn't seem to have affected NVDA or other semis much because what they cited was weakness that was exclusive to them and not the broader semis market.

**Ticker:** [**GOOG (Alphabet Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GOOG&p=d)

**Catalyst:** GOOG/GOOGL reported fourth-quarter 2024 earnings with an EPS of $2.12 vs. $2.12 expected. Revenue of $96.5 billion vs. $96.67 billion expected. Cited FAR more spending in CapEx and a miss in cloud revenue (which signals that other competitors have taken their market share)

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Market had a pretty negative reaction to the news that they'd be investing far more in capex and missed on cloud revenue (was roughly $9B vs $12B expected).

**Risks:** Elevated capital spending may pressure Alphabet's margins if the capex spending doesn't result in increased revenue, especially amidst increasing competition in the AI and cloud markets. I don't really see the China investigation to affect their stock price much, Google Search and Youtube are blocked in China and I doubt that China is going to let Waymo operate in their cities rather than creating their own solution.

**Catalyst:** The U.S. Postal Service has suspended accepting parcels from China and Hong Kong following new tariffs imposed by Trump, affecting logistics companies like UPS and FedEx.

**Technicals:** I'm mainly interested in PDD because they own Temu, which focuses on shipping small/low-cost goods to the US and using the loophole for very low shipping costs.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The recent suspension by USPS may lead to increased demand for private carriers like UPS and FedEx to handle parcels from China. There are a number of Chinese companies that focus on shipping low cost goods (like PDD).

**Risks:** Heightened tariffs and trade barriers could disrupt supply chains, increase costs, and lead to potential overreliance on private carriers, which may face capacity constraints and regulatory scrutiny.

**Ticker:** [**UBER (Uber Technologies)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UBER&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Uber reported fourth-quarter 2024 earnings with an EPS of $3.21 vs. $0.48 expected. Revenue of $12B vs. $11.8B expected. Cited that they plan to do buybacks of their own stock.

**Technicals:** Watching $60 level, no bias.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Despite Uber's strong quarterly performance, they cited a potential $1 billion impact from a strong U.S. dollar on future bookings which results in worse earnings overseas.

**Risks:** Outside of self-driving cars (Uber partnered with Waymo to operate in Austin), currency fluctuations and international markets affect companies you wouldn't normally expect. This may move in future from tariff news.

**Catalyst:** Trump announced that the United States plans to take over the Gaza Strip, relocate its residents to neighboring countries, and redevelop the area.

**Technicals:** USO didn't move much on this piece of news, but if Trump actually makes this a policy then we might see a LOT more volatility in the future depending on how serious we get and if we get involved again.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The oil sector is sensitive to geopolitical developments in the Middle East, a region critical to global oil supply. Initial market reactions to Trump's Gaza proposal didn't impact oil prices. Not really a catalyst TODAY but worth thinking about in the future.

**Risks:** Potential escalation of regional tensions could disrupt oil production or transportation, leading to supply constraints and increased volatility in oil prices.

2025-02-05 02:29:16,Microsoft,MSFT,Big tech CapEx: 2024 vs. 2025 and increase in AI server demand,"
AI infrastructure spending is accelerating faster than expected, with Microsoft, Google, and Meta massively increasing their CapEx in 2025 to keep up with AI demand.

CapEx Comparison: 2024 vs. 2025:

- MSFT: 55.7B in 2024 to 80B in 2025
- Google: 52.5B in 2024 to 75B in 2025
- Meta: 39B in 2024 to 60B in 2025

AI servers remain bottlenecked. Microsoft & Google can’t build AI data centers fast enough. That's why they couldn't beat expectations in cloud sales this quarter.

CapEx is being funneled into GPUs, networking, and AI-specific chips. This should make NVIDIA the biggest winner of this trend.

Also, OpenAI just introduced a new ""Deep Research"" AI model, designed for long-context reasoning. This will require even more compute power, further straining existing AI infrastructure. More power demand = more GPUs, networking gear, and data centers.

As long as AI models grow in complexity and scale, NVIDIA and AI infrastructure players should benefit. 

Even if Deepseek story was accurate, optimized model like Deepseek's will drive more demand, which will need even more powerful servers.

All the cases for yet another great year for chip makers especially NVIDIA, don't you think?",39,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ihzo1s/big_tech_capex_2024_vs_2025_and_increase_in_ai/

Yesterday was eventful, to say the least. Tariffs on Mexico/Canada are delayed, but we still have tariffs on China, and tariffs have been promised by Trump on the EU.

**Ticker:** [**PLTR (Palantir Technologies Inc)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Reported earnings of $0.14 vs. $0.11 expected. Revenue of $828 million vs. $777 million expected. Management highlighted the power of AI and their sizable contracts, citing the nature of the AI war being winner-take-all.

**Technicals:** PLTR absolutely exploded and hit $102 premarket, currently watching $100 level to see if we continue the move. Other than that unlikely to be trading this unless we have massive volume come in.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The PLTR ER highlighted the growing demand for AI-driven solutions across government/commercial sectors. Company emphasized securing substantial contracts in the competitive AI landscape, important because they are more closely aligned with the current government.

**Risks:** Obviously being more closely tied to the government means that it has more leeway to be more monopolistic/aggresive in their actions, Alex Karp and Peter Thiel are closely aligned with current government leaders.

**Related Tickers:** MSFT, GOOGL, IBM, AMZN

**Ticker:** [**NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Chinese AI company DeepSeek is reportedly preparing to switch to domestic GPUs to circumvent NVDA chip restrictions. DeepSeek has bypassed NVDA CUDA for certain operations, utilizing the PTX (Parallel Thread Execution) language instead. Additionally, on February 2nd, DeepSeek, in collaboration with SiliconFlow and Huawei Cloud, launched DeepSeek-R1/V3 inference services on Huawei's Ascend AI chips. Huawei is also promoting its new Ascend AI processors to Chinese groups considering ""inference"" as an option.

**Technicals:** After the insane move we've seen from $150 to $118, I actually don't consider this to be earth shattering news- China has always been trying to develop their own semis and not using NVDA for training is what they were ""supposed"" to be doing due to the trade restrictions. I'm still long but selling calls against my position, recovery might be slow for NVDA. It's interesting that they are attempting to bypass CUDA, which is essentially the ""standard"" for ML/AI training nowadays on NVDA chips and developing their own.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** DeepSeek's move to adopt domestic GPUs and bypass CUDA indicates they're aiming for technological self-reliance amidst U.S. export restrictions, rather than trying to adopt more NVDA chips (which presumably isn't a viable long term strategy).

**Risks:** Nvidia faces potential revenue loss if Chinese companies increasingly adopt domestic GPUs and alternative programming frameworks. The effectiveness of U.S. export controls may be undermined as Chinese firms develop workarounds.

**Ticker:** [**BABA**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d)**/(oil stocks, car stocks, etc).**

**Catalyst:** U.S. implemented a 10% tariff on all Chinese imports, aiming to address issues related to drug trafficking, particularly fentanyl. In response, China announced retaliatory tariffs effective February 10, including a 15% tariff on U.S. coal and liquefied natural gas, and a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery, and large-engine vehicles.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The imposition of these tariffs marks a significant escalation in U.S.-China trade tension and more volatility to come through Trump tweets- we might see a trade war again (sigh) like we did in 2019. Not 100% sure if agricultural machinery will affect stocks like DE but will look into it.

**Related Tickers:** JD, BIDU, TCEHY, PDD

**Offhand Comments:** There are going to be retaliation investigations against companies operating in America, INTC and GOOG have recently been announced as under investigation by China. But it's very important to remember which companies have a presence in China and which don't- for example, GOOG search hasn't worked in China since 2010 lol.

**Ticker:** [**GRAB (Grab Holdings Limited)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GRAB&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Grab Holdings Ltd. is considering a takeover of its Indonesian rival, GoTo Group, at a valuation of approximately $7 billion.

**Technicals:** Watching $5 level, no bias. I'm not 100% sure if there's an actual ""acquisition"" share price for GoTo but will keep eyes peeled for that acquisition premium.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The potential merger represents a significant consolidation in SEA's ride-hailing and food delivery sectors. Mergers typically streamline operations and reduce competition, leading to improved profitability for the combined entity.

**Risks:** The proposed merger may face regulatory hurdles, including antitrust concerns, which could delay or derail the deal. Standard M&A obstacles.

# [S&P 500 futures rise after Meta Platforms, Tesla report earnings: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/29/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> S&P 500 futures rose Thursday as Wall Street digested recent quarterly results from a slew of megacap tech companies. Investors are coming off a losing session after the Federal Reserve held steady on rates.
*****
> Futures tied to the broad market index added 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.5%. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were fractionally lower.
*****
> Shares of Meta Platforms and Tesla gained 1% and 2%, respectively, while Microsoft shares dipped more than 4% after the companies reported earnings. Meta beat on top and bottom lines, but Microsoft shares faltered after the company’s quarterly revenue forecast disappointed. Tesla shrugged off an earnings and revenue miss. On the other hand, revenue misses from UPS and Caterpillar weighed the indexes down.
*****
> Other “Magnificent Seven” names are set to report in the coming days, with Apple’s results being due for a Thursday release. Amazon will soon follow suit, as the megacap tech company reports next week.
*****
> On Wednesday, all three major averages ended the session lower as a 4% decline in Nvidia weighed on the market. The declines came after the Fed paused its interest rate-cutting campaign, leaving its borrowing rate unchanged in a range between 4.25% and 4.5%. In their post-meeting statement, policymakers noted that inflation remains “somewhat elevated.”

> “The implication is that we’re on hold until the inflation rate goes down, and unfortunately it’s probably not going to go down very much in the several months ahead, so I wouldn’t be looking for rate cuts at the next meeting,” Jeffrey Gundlach, DoubleLine Capital CEO, said Wednesday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.”
*****
> “We have a relatively stable place where we’re standing, and it kind of supports the fact that the market is in a calm position right now, and so is [Jerome] Powell apparently,” he said.
*****
> On the economic data front, the fourth-quarter gross domestic product reading is due on Thursday, and weekly jobless claims are out in the morning. Investors are also looking ahead to Friday’s personal consumption expenditures price index report for December.

however, its still using NVDA chips. it doesnt hurt NVDA at all. they can literally restrict supply chain. or just only continue to produce expensive flagships.

if Deepseeks tech caused companys that are also developing AI, such as Google, Open AI, MSFT, etc, that can somewhat make sense.

but i dont understand the hit on the company's thats designing/making the chips.

  
at the end of the day, they are still going to, and have to , rely on NVDA and TSM.

Both companies' stock were hit in the short term in the past on their plans for big AI spending. These are both good companies but since their earnings are juxtaposed to this risk-off market reaction to DeepSeek, can earnings be positive for MSFT and META?

2025-01-24 04:10:35,Microsoft,MSFT,Switched from Ameriprise managed account to Fidelity - Sell individual stocks?,"After a year of trying an Ameriprise managed account, I recently moved everything to Fidelity to start managing it myself. They underperformed the S&P500 (before their fee), and almost all positions are just S&P500 companies anyways, so I figured if I went 100% into an S&P index on my own I can't do worse.

I'm not sure how best to proceed with the current number of individual stocks. There are 64 positions total and it's unrealistic that I'll be able to keep track of the performance/trajectory of that many companies. Buffet's ""pick a few winners"" comes to mind. I've been assuming the best thing to do is to slowly liquidate the one's I don't have a specific interest in, and buy VOO/SPY in their place.

There are many companies that I like and would like to hold on to (AAPL, AMD, AMZN, BRKB, GOOGL, JNJ, KO, MSFT, NVDA, NFLX, PG). However, the majority are S&P 500 companies that I don't follow closely (ABT, ADBE, AMAT, AMGN, AMT, AVGO, AZN, BA, BMY, CAT, COP, CRM, CVX, ... to name a few). It's not that I don't know those companies, but it feels ignorant to hold onto them knowing that I won't have time to monitor their performance.

Is there a best way to go about liquidating those and moving into an S&P 500 index? Initial temptation is gambler's fallacy (sell the low performers first and keep the better ones a bit longer).",4,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1i8mzb1/switched_from_ameriprise_managed_account_to/

The 15% stake is worth roughly $250 million based on Applied Digital's closing price on Monday.

Shares of Applied Digital rose about 20% before the opening bell, as the Australian investment bank would become the company's largest shareholder according to LSEG data.

Since the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, providers of computing infrastructure like Applied Digital have been seeing heavy investment from companies looking to train their own AI models and get ahead of competitors. Macquarie's asset management arm has agreed to invest up to $900 million in a data center campus that Applied Digital is developing in North Dakota.

Dallas, Texas-based Applied Digital also has the right of first refusal to invest an additional $4.1 billion in future company data centers for 30 months, the company said. Applied Digital Chief Executive Wes Cummins said the deal provides the company with enough equity to construct data centers with high power demands.The new funding will be used to repay debt Applied Digital took on to build the facilities in North Dakota and will allow it to recover over $300 million of its equity investment in them, the firm said.

Applied Digital's shares have more than tripled in the past two years as investors bet on AI firms and data center providers to bring strong levels of growth.The video player is currently playing an ad.00:22Stocks end mixed as US yields stay elevatedMicrosoft.

Really good value per token processed. You can let it run for 5h to spend 1$, while with Claude the $ is finished in 10 minutes.  

It seems like the cost of intelligence really goes down a lot, approaching 0. Well, not really, but a whole lot.

Now, I'm struggling to interpret what this means for the stock of AI companies which invested heavily in these models. 

On one hand, AI really works and is progressing rapidly. Suggesting there are further benefits to get from AI.

On the other hand. The intelligence commodity is really cheap now. The DeepSeek model's weights are free. And it cost only 10M to train. AI companies which invested Billions on their models, just got their models superseded by a model which is now free for everyone. This is bigger news than the meta llama models, because this model now was trained really cheaply and the license says you can do whatever you like with it. 

If the cost of intelligence will be 0, will the AI companies like Goog and msft make money out of their investments?",70,74,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ho2a1j/impact_of_deepseek_v3_on_ai_stocks/

Looking at the stocks outside of the context of when I bought them, MSFT is outperforming 103% vs 97% but this still begs the question of why is MSFT only outperforming by that little when MSFT is 🚀 and WMT is 💩right?

> The analyst commented: ""Yesterday, Walmart closed its $2.3B acquisition of Vizio, which was announced in Feb 2024. Walmart's urgent need was driven by AMZN's decision to make all 200mm of its Prime Video subscribers ad- driven in Jan 2024. AMZN then linked its CTV ads to actual purchases made on its site, thereby creating the first RMN (retail media network) with ""closed-loop attribution"". Walmart will now ""fast follow"" AMZN and create a better RMN by tying Vizio's CTV ads to Walmart's online and offline sales.

2024-12-04 19:51:54,Microsoft,MSFT,"Intel’s CEO shakeup puts foundry plans, CHIPS Act cash at risk","Intel (INTC) is in crisis. The company forced out CEO Pat Gelsinger on Monday, its stock price is down more than 50% on the year, and the grand plan to add third-party semiconductor manufacturing to its repertoire is suddenly more unclear than ever.

Gelsinger’s gambit to transform Intel into a US-based version of Taiwan’s TSMC that builds chips for its rivals is one of the reasons the company received $7.8 billion in CHIPS Act funding. But the foundry business, which it plans to operate as an independent subsidiary, has been hemorrhaging money and its biggest customer is still Intel itself.

Yes, the company has picked up deals to build chips for Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN), but that hasn’t quelled calls for Intel to kill its third-party foundry plan. Bank of America Global Research analyst Vivek Arya wrote in an investor note that Intel could go as far as fully separating its design and manufacturing businesses.

But ditching its fabs, or fabrication facilities, is a lot easier said than done, especially if Intel wants to hold on to those CHIPS Act funds.

“They just got the CHIPS Acts money. And if you look very closely at the details, it basically says that Intel cannot sell more than a controlling share of the manufacturing footprint,” explained Mario Morales, group vice president of enabling technologies and semiconductors at IDC. “So that means that Intel will have to maintain manufacturing control of their capacity.”

In other words, there’s no easy path forward for the US’s largest homegrown chip builder.

The Commerce Department and Intel announced the chipmaker would be getting CHIPS Act funding just last week, with the DoC saying the cash would help Intel expand its manufacturing capacity in the US, a key part of Gelsinger’s plan to help the company compete with TSMC and Samsung, two of the largest chipmakers in the world.

Gelsinger initially unveiled the ambitious agenda, called IDM 2.0, or integrated device manufacturing 2.0, in 2021, the same year he took the reins as CEO. At the time, he said Intel would create a world-class foundry business. But Gelsinger took over an Intel beset by problems.

Lack of investment and missed opportunities over the years meant the company failed to catch the mobile wave and fell behind TSMC in design capabilities. And building out a global manufacturing footprint isn’t cheap, which, for a company that was already hurting, wasn’t ideal.

Gelsinger had four years to make the turnaround happen, and while Intel’s chip design process is catching up, building chip manufacturing facilities takes time, more than Intel’s board seemed interested in giving Gelsinger.

“Some of the problems that Intel had, and still has, are not things you can solve overnight. They are multiyear issues,” said TECHnalysis founder and chief analyst Bob O’Donnell.

“Gelsinger started on a path to follow some of these things. And I think ultimately, at the highest level, what he chose to do, which is to get the manufacturing stuff back in shape and to work on design, is ultimately what the company needs to do.”

Now Intel has to make a decision: carry on with Gelsinger’s plan or cut back and focus on its own chip building capabilities or give up the business entirely. But doing that means saying goodbye to CHIPS Act money unless it can get approval from the Commerce Department

Under the terms of the CHIPS Act agreement, Intel is prohibited from certain change of control transactions. If the company spins off its foundry business, it has to hold on to at least 50.1% of the voting rights of the entity if it’s a private company. If the new entity goes public, a third party can’t own 35% or more of it. That means Intel can’t simply cut its foundry business loose and go fabless if it wants to hold on to that CHIPS money.

But moving forward with the foundry model could be difficult.

“I think as a combined entity it's hard to survive, because the biggest problem is your potential customers for foundry are all your competitors against Intel products,” explained Gartner analyst Gaurav Gupta. “So how would they have trust in Intel foundry and become its customers, right?”

If Intel does end up pulling back on its third-party manufacturing ambitions, however, it could end up eating a good portion of the losses.

“You'd have to scale back. You'd have to lay off people. I'm sure there would be some sunk cost, but the alternative is you keep losing billions of dollars a quarter,” Citi head of US semiconductor research Chris Danely told Yahoo Finance. “So, I think you just need to scrap it. Take your lumps. If you have to, return the money to the government.”

While Danely believes Intel should drop its goal of serving as a global foundry for other companies, he says it should continue to build its own chips.

“I still think they should manufacture their own CPUs,” he explained. ""There's been speculation for a long time that they're just going to turn the keys over to [TSMC] and have [TSMC] make everything. We don't think that that's the right move.”

Before that, however, Intel needs to find a new permanent CEO.

Even Google has given up its 5% gain from yesterday. Matching the drop, the VIX closed at 23.16, and the 10-year Treasury Yield closed about the same at 4.29%. 

Should Apple and Amazon disappoint post-market today, I think a correction could be on. The main bullish factor countering a volatile election week, a VIX over 23 and high yields of 4.3% is strong earnings, especially from the M-7. Clearly, that doesn’t seem to be happening.

Meta  - Initially, it seemed like a perfunctory one percent drop on a small beat and in-line guidance, but it’s gone a lot further as Meta is down 4% to 570.

**Why the rout?** Analysts and investors panned high Capex plans of $40Bn and costly high-risk bets such as Meta’s Reality Labs unit, (the developer of augmented and virtual reality technologies), which logged a staggering operating loss of $4.4 billion 

Microsoft - (down 6% to $408) is getting clobbered for a different reason. Even as Azure grew 34%, the pace wasn’t enough, and guidance of 31% to 32% in constant currency was lower than expected. However, this is due to supply chain constraints as President Amy Hood noted that the 1 or 2-point deceleration Microsoft has guided is mainly due to some supply pushouts, in terms of AI supply coming online that the company counted on. (Read, not as many Blackwells/Hoppers as they would have liked)

""We expect consumption growth to be stable compared to Q1, and we expect to add more sequential dollars to Azure than any other quarter in history,"" Hood added.

The indomitable Dan Ives of Wedbush remains as bullish as ever…

""We actually disagree with this initial take as the new Azure reporting standards have moved Street numbers all around and a slight deceleration is totally expected by many investors with some supply constraints and reacceleration in 2H25, and we would be strong buyers of MSFT on any weakness this morning,"" Wedbush analysts, led by Daniel Ives, said in a note.",0,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ggp3pm/the_sp_500_and_the_nasdaq_composite_with_losses/
2024-10-29 20:47:24,Microsoft,MSFT,Prediction: Apple is grossly priced compared to Microsoft,"Congrats to those that followed my last Costco post. I don’t believe anyone can really predict the ups and downs of the market, and with the current market climbing past ATH’s, the safest bets are going to be balanced long-short positions in specific equities or spread bets. 

**Apple**

* Market cap: 3.6T
* Current P/E: \~36
* Average P/E last 5 years: 28.6
* Historical revenue growth: Flat to single digits
* Earnings growth: Low double digits
* Net Margin: 25%

 **Microsoft**

* Market cap: 3.2T
* Microsoft P/E: \~36
* Average P/E last 5 years: 32.8
* Historical revenue growth: 15%
* Earnings growth: 15-20%
* Net margin: 35%

Last week, Apple had a higher P/E than MSFT, before this narrowed in the last few days Relative to Microsoft. Apple is still at historically high valuations relative to MSFT, despite Microsoft having better margins and growth. And the reasons are silly. Apple is getting a massive boost due to a ""potential supercycle"" with no proof that it’s actually happening (even the most optimistic projections are just slightly better than last year) and mediocre software releases, while Microsoft took a large hit last quarter because it forecasted larger capex and delays in direct GenAI revenue realization.

In my view, the market is pricing in a divergent and fundamental misunderstanding of GenAI and how it makes money. The Apple bull case hypothesis is correct, it’s just applied to the wrong company. The Microsoft supercycle isn’t going to be from direct GenAI subscriptions like Co-pilot, it’s going to be share shift towards Azure and increased utilization.

To me it is hopium to believe that retail consumers will be rushing aggressively to switch or upgrade their phones over a nascent GenAI capability that is inferior to its peers (other than privacy) and unlocks nominal value, while mid-large corporates won’t be doing the exact same for Microsoft for what is widely considered a top-notch set of capabilities and proven effectiveness in several emerging use cases.

Here’s my prediction – regardless of where the market goes, I believe there is going to be a strong and continued divergence between Microsoft & Apple performance in the next few months, with at least another 5% gap between the winner and loser, with Microsoft’s P/E once against comfortably retaking the lead from Apple. Good luck and we'll see!

Tl;dr: Short Apple / Long Microsoft

P.S. Seeing a lot of people triggered by the tl;dr recommendation not having a basic understanding of what long-short position is. A balanced long-short position doesn't mean I believe Apple will go down on nominal terms, just that it will go down relative to Microsoft.

I agree with a value investing philosophy, so to me never selling implies the original investment thesis doesn’t change. 

I think we could have an interesting discussion if we share our age (or age range) and the company in which we trust for the rest of our lives (and why).

I’m in my 30s, so assuming I live for the next 50 years, I believe Lockheed Martin ($LMT) will remain an important player in the defense sector, as I expect war (mostly proxy wars) to continue being used for political interests and if the US DoD sees its budget reduced, our current Western society’s paradigm will be over.

2024-10-18 14:59:12,Microsoft,MSFT,I Flipped My Entire Portfolio of ETFs for AI Stocks,"Yesterday, I made a major shift in my stock portfolio. I used to rely on ETFs like SPY, QQQ, and SCHD, but now I’ve sold most of them and focused on NVDA, MSFT, GOOGL, ISRG, AAPL, SCHG, and a bit of SOXX.

 - NVDA $237K

 - SCHG $121K

 - MSFT $105K

 - GOOGL $78K

 - AAPL $74K

 - ISRG $64K

 - SOXX $61K

 - BRK-B $47K

Here’s why: Right now, AI might feel limited to things like ChatGPT, but its potential goes far beyond that. Over the next 3, 5, or 10 years, AI is going to transform industries in ways we can’t fully imagine yet. We’re talking about healthcare revolutionizing how we diagnose and treat patients, transportation with autonomous vehicles and drones making logistics smarter and more efficient, and manufacturing, where AI will optimize production processes and supply chains.

Now, I know what you're thinking: 'What, you think the world is full of cave dwellers? Who doesn't know that?' and you're right. Everyone knows AI techonology will be advanced and utilized in so many ways in the near future.

But look, you can think of it like real estate. Sure, property values rise while new highways or shopping centers are being built, but the real surge in value happens once people start using them and see the full benefits. Right now, AI is still in its “under construction” phase—people can imagine the future potential, but the true value hasn’t been fully realized yet. The market has priced in expectations, sure, but once AI is fully integrated across industries and we start seeing its widespread, real-world impact, I believe we’ll see another major surge in stock prices. What’s priced in now is just the beginning—the real growth will come as AI starts transforming daily life and business on a much larger scale.

Before ChatGPT went mainstream, people assumed ‘just’ that level of AI technology would arrive soon enough, but they didn’t think it would have this much of an impact on stock prices once it came to life for the public. Everyone knew advanced AI was on the horizon, but the market didn’t price it like they do now. This shows just how much underestimation happens until we truly start experiencing the technology firsthand. And that’s why, despite what’s already been priced in, I think AI stocks are still undervalued given the game-changing growth ahead. Anyone else rethinking their portfolio with AI at the center?",0,64,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g6k31k/i_flipped_my_entire_portfolio_of_etfs_for_ai/

Short Summary:

  
Google’s share of the U.S. search ad market is expected to drop below 50% next year for the first time in over a decade

Biggest competitors:  Challenge faced from Amazon (shoppers bypass google and directly search the items on E-commerce website), Bing (market share has grown steadily since Feb 2023 according to [Search Engine Market Share Worldwide | Statcounter Global Stats](https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share#monthly-202302-202409)), Perplexity AI (Nvidia software engineers switched away from google when comes search related to work. ), GPTSearch (yet to be release), Tiktok (younger generations)

Perplexity AI: startup will allow brands to sponsor follow-up questions that trigger a back-and-forth with the use. “What we’re opening up is the ability for a brand to spark or inspire somebody to ask a question about them,” Shevelenko said.

  
Bing:  [Microsoft](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/MSFT) has introduced [sponsored links](https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en/blog/post/september-2023/transforming-search-and-advertising-with-generative-ai) and comparison-shopping ads in a chatbot attached to its Bing search engine. Almost 60% of U.S. consumers used a chatbot to help research or decide on a purchase in the past 30 days, 



TikTok said “search behaviors have evolved” and added that the platform had global daily search volume of over three billion, with 23% of users searching for something within 30 seconds of opening the app.

2024-10-01 15:23:05,Microsoft,MSFT,The Crash of the stock market has arrived. Price/Earnings ratio just broke 30 for the entire S&P 500. ,"Almost 90 days ago I made a post in an alternate subreddit regarding why I believe the stock market will begin to crash within 120 days -- Essentially the crash will begin by the day before the election. I have included that entire post below -- and all of these reasons still remain relevant... Moreso than ever with the news from the Middle East today. Obviously the port strike is expediting things today. Nonetheless -- I think the post is super relevant, and for some reason, the moderators of WSB deleted the post after 6 hours, despite it receiving over 2.2 million views, and over 1100 shares. 

The ride the market has been on, quite simply, has been insane.

According to generally accepted wisdom -- by investing in the S&P 500, you can anticipate to double your money, on average, every 6.5 years. I'm not 100% certain as to why that's the accepted figure -- as calculating the last 14 6.5 year periods the average rate of return has been 64%.

Below is a chart of the average price/rate of return of GSPC (The S&P) over the last 14 cycles.. I couldn't easily find data prior to this..

|Year|GSPC Price|6.5 year return on investment|
|:-|:-|:-|
||
|1933.5|10.91||
|1940|12.05|10.44%|
|1946.5|18.43|52.95%|
|1953|26.38|43.13%|
|1959.5|58.68|122%|
|1966|92.88|58%|
|1972.5|107.14|15%|
|1979|99.93|-7.22%|
|1985.5|191.85|91.90%|
|1992|408.78|113%|
|1998.5|1133.84|177%|
|2005|1181.27|4.10%|
|2011.5|1320.64|11.70%|
|2018|2471.65|87.10%|
|2024.5|5525.29|123%|

While the last two cycles don't necessarily ring any alarm bells -- we have just more than doubled, twice, looking at the last two cycles -- There is one massive, bloated, shit filled elephant in the room... Price to Earnings Ratio.

Historically, the Price to Earnings ratio for the S&P has sat just under 20 (the easiest data I could find puts it at 19.4x between 1974 and 2017 -- I'm not grabbing any arbitrary dates or numbers here). The Median value has it under 18x, and there have even been extended periods of time where it traded at +/- 10x.

Currently -- the P/E ratio sits at 28.71 -- roughly 150% of what is normal.

In the history of the S&P, the P/E ratio has hit this level only 3 times...

* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Dot Com Bubble (P/E broke 30 +/- April 2001).
* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Global Financial Crisis (P/E broke 30 +/- October 2008).
* The quarter after Covid hit. (P/E broke 30 +/- March 2020).

Images aren't allowed in this subreddit -- but if you go to the multpl website you will see we finished trading yesterday, 09/30, at a P/E of 30.07

Historically -- what has happened to the markets after crossing this mark? In all three scenarios, by the time we crossed a P/E of 30, the dam had already started to break.

* During the Dot Com bubble, the S&P 500 was already down 19% from its highs, and would fall another 34% before finally starting to recover. By the the time the bleeding stopped, it had lost 47% of its value.
* During the global financial crisis, an almost identical story can be told. The S&P had lost 18% of its value by time P/E broke 30, and when it finally bottomed out in February of 2009, it lost 53% of its total value.
* Covid, obviously, was a much quicker recovery... as we only fell 32%, and had bounced back in less than 6 months time (reason for which outlined later).

**Okay -- so** ***Maybe*** **we have a price to earnings ratio problem, but you're still not sold. What else do we have going on?**

Outside of the fact that I firmly believe that the market is overvalued today, I think there are several other major issues that we are facing in the current environment -- and while I could write a diatribe for each, for purposes of succinctness, I'll simply outline them via bullet points below.

* Credit card debt is at an all time high, and outside of a brief period after Covid checks arrived, has been rising since 2013.
* Younger Americans are in the most trouble with credit card debt. As boomers continue to retire, it will be the working class most disproportionately affected.
* Credit card delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2011.
* Auto loans debt and average auto loan payments are the highest they've been at any point in history. Auto loan delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2010.
* The stock market is insanely top heavy right now. The Magnificent 7 (Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA)) now account for 45% of the entire value of the Nasdaq. They account for roughly 30% of the entire stock market combined. As of today -- they are trading at a combined P/E of 42x. A correction in these 7 companies would be absolutely catastrophic for the entire market as a whole.
* We are starting to see a weakening of the labor market. Furthermore -- I do not believe the jobs numbers are entirely as they seem. I think many of the jobs 'added' over the last 18 months have been individuals picking up second jobs to help make ends meet. Any reasonable increase in the unemployment rate have absolutely massive consequences.
* Many banks are holding on to massive unrealized losses. While this has the potential to hit the regional banks the worst, some of the largest banks -- including Bank of America, Charles Schwab, and USAA have unbooked security losses that are greater than 50% of their equity capital.
* Regional banks are at risk due to the massive amounts of US treasury notes they hold that were bought during Covid. In short -- nobody was borrowing money to buy homes or cars. Banks, flush with cash, took said money and bought US T notes with this money so they could earn some interest on it. This was at a time when interest rates were very low. Now that interest rates are high -- demand for these old t notes is essentially non existent, as you buy new t notes that pay a much higher rate of return. If any sort of bank run starts, these banks will be forced to liquidate said t-bills, and they will have to sell them at a loss. If too many people do this simultaneously, the bank will become insolvent -- like what we saw happen with Silicon Valley bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank. (Side note -- the failure of these three banks alone was larger than the combined total of bank failures in 2008 during the global financial crisis).
* The US government still has a spending problem. Our deficit has grown by $500 million since I started writing this an hour ago.
* Global tensions are high -- and rising. Massive protests are erupting all over Europe.
* The US is involved in two proxy wars that don't appear as if they will abate any time soon.
* The political division in the US is as dramatic as I've seen it at any point in my existence. Perhaps those older and wiser than me can chime in here -- but it seems most are resorting to tribal, identity politics split down party lines.
* Commercial real estate is starting to buckle. Covid brought about work from home, and with many offices retaining those practices, or allowing partial work from home, office space supply far outpaces demand. This problem is exacerbated by high interest rates. Most commercial loans are done on 5 or 7 year balloon. When that balloon is bout to come due, the owner of that property will refinance the loan, restarting the 5 or 7 year period to avoid paying off the balance owed on the property. Many of these property owners that refinanced into low interest rates in 2020, during covid, when rates bottomed out -- are now having to get a new loan to keep from paying their balloon. However, with interest rates more than twice what they were several years ago, and vacancy rates skyrocketing, many of these real estate owners will not be able to pay the monthly mortgage on their buildings. Commercial Real Estate foreclosures jumped 117% in March alone.
* Housing has become increasingly less affordable for many Americans. For 2022 -- the most recent year I could find data -- a family earning the median US household income, renting a median priced US home, was spending 40% of their income on rent.
* Countries are abandoning the US dollar in droves.

I believe some of these issues, on their own, are enough to cause serious economic turmoil. Bundled together, I don't see how we aren't in for a very rude awakening.

**This economic downturn may be severe.**

In the three times this has happened before -- the action, or lake thereof varied dramatically. During scenario one -- the dot com bubble -- the government largely just let the companies fail. While I was only 11 at the time, my understanding is that there really were no bailouts here because the only people really hurt were the investors in those companies -- unlike scenario two. During the GFC, shuttering banks would have resulted in a complete collapse of the US (and really global) financial system. While I won't get into partisan politics, I'm of the belief that the covid bailouts were entirely unnecessary -- and more importantly for this post -- the reason that the upcoming crash is going to be so insanely problematic.

**Bailouts on any level, whether to companies, banks, or directly to citizens, will inevitably increase inflation. I don't think they are on the table for this correction.**

People have painted the inflation problem as a result of supply chain issues... And while supply chain issues didn't help, I think the bigger issue, by far, was the sheer amount of money we printed. You cannot make $4 trillion appear out of thin air and expect that every dollar in circulation isn't going to suddenly become worth less money. We just lived through this reality after the Covid printing.

This will largely tie the feds hands. Print more money -- we find ourselves in a cycle of ever increasing prices and higher interest rates.

**What happens from here?**

I don't know. Don't listen to me. I'm an idiot. Stock market will probably just continue to go up. I'm probably wrong about 100% of this.

The prediction in bold below is what I posted 90 days ago. I now believe the top is officially in -- that we won't see another ATH for a long time. 

**My Prediction? GSPC/SPY cruise up a tiny bit further, to +/- $5900/$590 -- before retreating to $3500/$350 by 12/2025.**

There are also signs of strain in the group’s relationship with Microsoft, which has committed $13bn to OpenAI and hitched its AI strategy to the start-up’s success. The companies are increasingly competing for customers, while Microsoft is building its own consumer AI team under Inflection founder Mustafa Suleyman and has designated OpenAI as a “competitor” in its annual report.

# [Stock futures rise slightly as traders debate how big the Fed’s anticipated rate cut will be: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/17/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures rose slightly Wednesday as Wall Street anticipated the first Federal Reserve interest rate cut in four years. Gains were muted as uncertainty lingered over how big the easing will be from the central bank.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 36 points, or 0.1%. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq-100 futures advanced 0.2% each.
*****
> The Fed is expected to deliver its latest policy decision at 2 p.m. ET. The central bank is expected to lower rates by at least a quarter percentage point, but traders are divided over how big the reduction will be. CME Group’s FedWatch tool shows traders pricing in a 65% chance of a half-point cut and 35% odds of a quarter-point move.
*****
> It’s unusual to have this much uncertainty into a Fed decision as the central bank typically tries to telegraph its next move to the markets. Traders had believed for most of the last month that the Fed would lower by a quarter point, but the idea of a super-sized cut began to gain traction in the past week.
*****
> “You’d have to go back over 15 years to find such an uncertain situation this close to the decision. A lot of money will be made and lost today,” Jim Reid, Deutsche Bank head of global economics and thematic research, wrote in a Wednesday note.
*****
> The ushering in of a cutting cycle is expected to shore up a stalling economy and further boost an already strong market, with the S&P 500 at a record following an 18% gain this year. The benchmark has averaged gains of about 16% in the 12 months following the first cut, according to data from Canaccord Genuity.
*****
> Despite these market expectations, some investors remain cautious about cutting rates too much, too soon. Peter Cecchini, Axonic Capital’s director of research, called a 50 basis point cut “unusual” as the first move in a cutting cycle from the Fed given the current state of the housing market.
*****
> “This is not really the environment where I think the Fed needs to do a 50 basis point cut as a preemptive measure, when historically it’s never done so,” he told CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Tuesday.
*****
> Wall Street is coming off a mixed session that saw the S&P 500 edge up 0.03% after notching another all-time high during intraday trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly 16 points, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.2%.

# [Stock futures rise as Wall Street awaits retail sales data, Fed policy meeting: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/16/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures rose Tuesday as Wall Street readied for key retail sales data and the start of the Federal Reserve’s September policy meeting.
*****
> Futures tied to the S&P 500 added 0.4%, while Nasdaq-100 futures gained 0.6%. Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 131 points, or 0.3%.
*****
> Microsoft rose 2% after the tech giant hiked its quarterly dividend by 10.7% to 83 cents per share. The company also approved a $60 billion buyback program.
*****
> Intel shares popped about 7% in premarket trading after the company said it plans to make its foundry business a subsidiary. The Biden administration also awarded the company up to $3 billion in funding through the Chips Act.
*****
> Investors on Tuesday will parse retail sales data for August for one final glimpse into the health of the U.S. consumer ahead of the Fed rate decision. Economists polled by Dow Jones are bracing for a 0.2% decline. Excluding autos, they see a 0.2% gain. The results could affect the rate cut outcome.
*****
> Wall Street is on standby for the Fed’s long-anticipated rate cut, a move that could help boost earnings growth for companies following a backdrop of steep borrowing costs and high inflation. The Fed first embarked on its aggressive hiking campaign in March 2022.
*****
> While Wall Street expects a cut Wednesday, the market is divided on the size of the potential reduction. Traders are currently pricing in a 67% chance that the central bank eases rates by 50 basis points, according to CME Group’s Fed Watch tool. That’s up from a roughly 47% chance Friday.
*****
> “Market expectations are split between a 25 basis point and a 50 basis point rate cut, as the decision is complicated by conflicting signals of solid economic activity but a weakening labor market,” said Principal Asset Management’s Seema Shah. “Rarely have market expectations been so torn, so close to a [Federal Open Market Committee] meeting.”
*****
> While a 50 basis point cut isn’t out of the question, the chief global strategist thinks that the Fed should take a more cautious approach to cutting and ease rates by 25 basis points. She is forecasting additional 25 basis point cuts in November and December.
*****
> Wall Street is coming off a mixed trading session. The 30-stock Dow rose more than 228 points, or 0.55%, to close at a record high, while the S&P 500 added 0.13%. The Nasdaq Composite lost 0.52% as Apple and prominent chip stocks declined.

2024-08-29 20:00:52,Microsoft,MSFT,"Apple, Nvidia in talks to join OpenAI funding round, media reports say","Source is [WSJ](https://archive.ph/6xB7b) & [Bloomberg](https://archive.ph/Tr024) via [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-talks-join-openai-funding-round-wsj-reports-2024-08-29/). 

>The Wall Street Journal first reported on Apple's interest, citing sources, while Bloomberg News reported on Nvidia's potential involvement.
The news comes a day after the Journal reported that venture capital firm Thrive Capital would invest around $1 billion in OpenAI, leading the funding round.

> Apple and OpenAI not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment, while Thrive Capital, Nvidia and Microsoft declined comment.
OpenAI has become increasingly important to Apple's artificial intelligence strategy, with the iPhone maker bringing the AI firm's chatbot, ChatGPT, to Apple devices in June as part of ""Apple Intelligence.""

>Apple was also reported to gain an observer role on OpenAI's board.

>Microsoft (MSFT.O), opens new tab, OpenAI's largest strategic investor with over $10 billion invested, is also expected to participate in the funding round, according to the WSJ report.

OpenAI's high valuation is a result of the AI arms race it sparked with the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, prompting companies across industries to invest billions in the technology to stay ahead of the competition and capture market share.

2024-08-22 13:49:37,Microsoft,MSFT,How many stocks is too many? I hold 50 now.. Better just go for an index ETF?,"So over years, I've been gathering over 50 stocks. Of course, some have performed great, largely because my timing, mid-2022, was an excellent entry point. But of course, I can't help brag about my selection choice. For example, Qualcomm, AMD, JPM, MSFT, GOOG, Citi.

I (think), I hit most of the semiconductor names, except NVDA. For some reason, it never felt like a good investment. I have my skepticism about LLMs and Gen-AI hype. Besides, generating cat pics or idle plays with Chat-GPT, I haven't ***yet*** seen a business effectively using Gen-AI as a compelling competitive edge. So, please educate me here as well. AMD is different because of data center servers product line - which is more solid story.

Besides missing such obvious biggies, not all of what I touched has performed. I felt, European carmakers (BMW, VW, MBG) were deep value at PE 3-5 and 8-9% yields, but obviously I was wrong. They were cheap for a reason.

**Main question** - I was wondering if I can do a simulation of hypothetical scenario where I had simply invested in index, saving me enormous time in research. If so, please suggest tools/sites?

Note that the amounts and time of entry/exit are not constant, so I can't use the simple lumpsum or periodic investing calculators that assume regular constant amounts and intervals.

With 50 stocks in my portfolio, I wonder if it is just mirroring the index, or generating any real alpha. Obviously, when I buy something, I am highly convinced of my reasonings. So, it's hard to part with what I feel are ""my gems"". How do you cope with these emotional aspects of investing?",115,170,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1eyjtg8/how_many_stocks_is_too_many_i_hold_50_now_better/

All of my positions excluding INTC (which is only slightly down) are heavy in the green. I’m quite happy with my gains (4 are 45%+)so far in just a few weeks. I think the upcoming rate cuts signaled by the Fed Minutes released today will propel the market further forward, assuming Friday goes as expected. I’m still holding all my call positions. I feel many of you were overly pessimistic on my original post but I forgive you. Did I do good? Should I sell? How do you all feel the market will fare the rest of the year? Cheers 🥂

Thinking about moving some of my MSFT/AMZN money into AMD. ,"After the Intel crash, I looked into some other stocks and notixed that AMD is down 20% in the past 6 months.

2024-08-14 06:37:45,Microsoft,MSFT,The Consumer Recession of 2023-2024 and the Future,"Alright so this going to be a long post so bear with me. I think we are currently in a consumer recession right now. Now you’re probably thinking ok but how? GDP continues to grow, unemployment continues to be stable, and the market is higher than ever right now. I am going to talk about some companies here that will hopefully give support to my theory.  

1. Microsoft (MSFT)

Now you’re probably wondering why this is the first company I am bringing up when Microsoft grew revenue and income. Microsoft grew revenue by 10% and net income by 20%. Microsoft does both software and hardware. The software parts of the business like Office, Cloud, and Services increased substantially. However when you look at the hardware side of the business it paints a different picture. 

Device revenue decreased 20%. These are things like personal computers, accessories, and other electronics that Microsoft sells and this part of their business declined considerably. Gaming revenue decreased by 5% with Xbox hardware sales falling 11%. We are currently seeing a similar trend in 2024. People are pulling back on items like PCs and gaming consoles. 

Now you’re probably thinking “yeah random redditor not everybody buys PCs/Xboxs every year. This means nothing.” 

So now we go to our next company. 

2. Apple

Like Microsoft Apple is a big tech company that is integrated into our society and the every day consumer. If you don’t personally use them you know someone who uses their products. If we look at Apples results in 2023 and we look at product sales they declined from 316.1 billion to 298 billion. Hardware sales were down across the board. Macs, iPhones, iPads, and Wearables all declined. However no what didn’t decline? Services. Like Microsoft services grew for Apple from 78.1 billion to 85.2 billion. Once again we are seeing this pattern of physical products that appeal to the middle class consumer fall. 

Now you’re probably thinking “yeah random redditor but Apple isn’t cool anymore so of course their products are not selling. So that makes no sense and means nothing in the grand scheme of things.” Ok let’s keep going. 

3. Nike

Nike is a global fashion and one of the biggest in the world if not the biggest. Like Apple if you don’t use their products you personally know someone who uses them. They’re everywhere. Nike reported a decline in revenue by 2% in 2024 and is currently forecasting a 10% drop in Q1 2025 and a drop for the full year of 2025. We saw Nike report product declines like their shoes in 2024 and it’s expected to get worse in 2025. The stock is currently sitting at a multi year low and besides Covid these levels haven’t been seen since 2018.

Now you’re probably thinking “ok random redditor but Nike isn’t cool anymore and Adidas is better and sells more track suits to the Eastern Europeans. So it makes sense why it’s down.” Ok lets look at more. 

4. Home Depot and Lowe’s

The two home building retailer giants of the US. If you own a home or have done work on your home you’re familiar with these 2 companies. These 2 companies are staples to the entire US economy. Similar to UPS and FedEx if you want to get a general look at how the economy is doing you’re paying attention to these two companies as they’re crucial to its health. In 2023 we saw Home Depots sales decrease by 3% and earnings decrease by 9.5%. We just saw Home Depot recently report their earnings and according to them they expect more pain as the consumer continues to pullback. We saw a similar result for Lowe’s. They reported a net sales decrease of 11% and are forecasting another sales decrease in 2024. With expectations being another 2-3% fall in comparable sales. 

Both Home Depot and Lowe’s stock are still down from their highs in 2021. Home Depot is down 16% and Lowe’s down 10% which was close to 3 years ago. 

Now you’re probably thinking “ok random redditor but those are boomer companies nobody cares about.” Ok how about another one. 

5. Target 

Target is a company that you know well cause you either have a mom or a girlfriend or both who spends their day there. Target is the upperclass Walmart that is a bit more luxurious and like all the other companies I mention they appeal to the middle/high class. 

In 2023 Target reported a sales decline of 1.7% and a comparable sales decline of 3.7%. Full year revenue decreased by 1.7%. The company going forward is expecting a continued consumer pullback and is expecting either flat or declines. Target stock is currently down 48% from its high with its high being in 2021. 

I can really keep going with this. Here is some more. 

1. Estee Lauder: massive stock decline

2. Ulta Beauty: massive stock decline

3. UPS (a crucial economic stock): massive stock decline

4. Lululemon: massive stock decline

5. Dollar General: massive stock decline

6. Hershey: massive stock decline 

7. Starbucks: massive stock decline

Now what is the point of all of this and all these companies mentioned and talked about? These are all companies that sell a semi luxury product that appeals to the middle class consumer. Now we are seeing the middle class  consumer pull back on these products. Maybe you’re not buying the next Microsoft PC this year, or the new iPhone, or the new pair of Nike sneakers due to rising costs in other areas. This is causing the market to price in future bad results and causing the stock price to crash. 

We are seeing a case where the market is not reflecting the economy. Businesses all across various industries are showing declines across the board and it’s only expected to get worse. Now with all these declines in other industries why is the market so high? The answer is tech. Companies like Nvidia, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Meta, Broadcom, Qualcomm, AMD, etc. are dominating the market. With these stocks continuing to increase and other stocks continuing to decrease it’s only getting worse. They have a heavy weight on the indexes and they’re causing most of the gains in the index while we are seeing other sectors decline. 

This has caused tech valuations to soar and other areas of the market to lag. Now what does this mean going forward. Are we due for a massive decline in the market where we see tech finally come down? 

I personally don’t think so. However I think going forward we won’t see the returns that tech has given now going forward. I think these stock declines in the market has presented opportunities and we can possibly see a sector rotation. For example the Fed cutting rates and alleviating pressure on the consumer. A case where tech lags behind and we see other areas of the market which have fallen start to climb. I could be wrong on this but these are just my thoughts. Let me know what you think about this theory.",176,120,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1eruoyr/the_consumer_recession_of_20232024_and_the_future/

2024-08-01 18:13:46,Microsoft,MSFT,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

2024-07-31 23:02:59,Microsoft,MSFT,"Nasdaq, S&P 500 post best day since Feb after Powell signals possible rate cut in Sept","The three major U.S. averages on Wednesday ended solidly higher, after Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said an interest rate cut ""could be on the table as soon as September"" if data on inflation and the labor market continued to improve.
Powell's remarks, along with a powerful rebound in chip stocks, helped the Nasdaq Composite (COMP:IND) and the benchmark S&P 500 (SP500) post their best intraday gain each since February 22.


The Nasdaq Composite climbed 2.64% to settle at 17,599.40 points, while the S&P 500 closed out the final day of the month with an advance of 1.58% to 5,522.30 points. The blue-chip Dow (DJI) added 0.24% to conclude at 40,843.06 points.


U.S. Treasury yields moved lower after Powell's comments, as traders snapped up bonds. The longer-end 10-year yield (US10Y) fell to its lowest level since March, dropping 7 basis points to 4.032%.

Earlier, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) held the federal funds rate steady at 5.25%-5.50%, a largely given outcome.


The attention was on Powell's post-decision press conference, amid hopes that the central bank chief would talk about interest rate cuts in September. And Powell did not disappoint.


He signaled that policymakers could be considering an interest rate cut as soon as September if they continued to see inflation moving quickly or in line with their expectations, growth remaining reasonably strong and the labor market staying consistent with its current conditions.


According to the CME FedWatch tool, the odds of a 50 basis point rate cut in September climbed after Powell's comments, underscoring the market's confidence that the monetary policy easing cycle was imminent. There is now a 90.5% chance of a 25 bp cut, a 9.5% chance of a 50 bp cut, and a 0.0% chance of a 0 bp cut.

Nvidia (NVDA) surged 17%, after Morgan Stanley re-added the chip giant to its top picks list following the stock's recent selloff. In addition, Microsoft and Meta reiterated and increased their capital expenditure investments, signaling further revenue upside for Nvidia. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) climbed 4%, after the world's second-largest maker of personal computer processors issued current quarter revenue guidance that was above consensus estimates.

Microsoft (MSFT) slipped 1%, after the tech behemoth's cloud business missed on revenue and its quarterly capital expenditure swelled to $19B.


Turning to Wednesday's economic calendar, ADP's jobs report before the opening bell showed private sector employment growing by 122K in July, significantly lower than the consensus figure of 154K. Shortly after, a key gauge of Q2 U.S. labor costs rose lesser than anticipated while also slowing down from the previous quarter.",229,68,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1eh18cy/nasdaq_sp_500_post_best_day_since_feb_after/

2024-07-30 20:08:09,Microsoft,MSFT,Microsoft shares drop as cloud miss overshadows better-than-expected revenue,"Microsoft shares fell 7% in extended trading on Tuesday after the software company reported disappointing cloud revenue, overshadowing stronger earnings and revenue than analysts had predicted.

Here’s how the company did, compared with the LSEG consensus:

Earnings per share: $2.95 vs. $2.93 expected

Revenue: $64.73 billion vs. $64.39 billion expected

Microsoft’s revenue increased 15% year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended on June 30, according to a statement. Net income, at $22.04 billion, was up from $20.08 billion, or $2.69 per share, in the year-ago quarter.

Revenue from Azure and other cloud services grew 29% during the quarter. Analysts polled by CNBC and StreetAccount had expected 31% growth. Microsoft doesn’t disclose revenue from the category in dollars. Last week Google parent Alphabet said revenue from its cloud business, encompassing Workspace productivity software and Google Cloud Platform infrastructure, went up by about 29%. 

During the fiscal fourth quarter, Microsoft started selling Surface PCs with AI features that can run certain models locally without the need for an internet connection. Dell, HP and other device makers also touted their own so-called Copilot+ PCs. CEO Satya Nadella said at a press briefing in May that “we’re bringing real joy and a sense of wonder back to creation on the PC.”

I know MSFT is reflected in VTSAX but only a tiny percent of it since VTSAX is the total stock market (not sure if it’s US or Global now that I think about it).

Of course if I never sold 1,000 shares I'd be up like $500k but it's risky. Thinking of slowly selling my MSFT shares over the next 6-12 months to better diversify and put that $ into the 2 ETFs XLK and SCHG since I already have MSFT exposure there?

I looked at Blackrock, and it seem to be doing fine. 6 bln income growing YoY, and 11bln in debt, which is ok. The company has a strong competitive position, over 11tn in assets under management, and an healthy PE of 20. I think that growth is likely to continue, (rising valuations, launch on new blackrock ETFs, service expansion) and their position is too dominant to be disrupted. I am not sure of their pricing power though, their ETFs clients are very sensitive, but at that scale they should fund a way to monetize (revenue is around 0.17% of their AUM). I don't see much risk, except for valuation, but I would like to hear different opinion and see if I am missing something.",2,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1dzuh1i/what_are_your_thoughts_on_blackrock_as_a/
2024-07-08 22:14:54,Microsoft,MSFT,"MSFT and AAPL are overvalued and overbought, Wallstreet is expecting too much from AI. ","I got to try Microsoft's copilot this week and i have to say i was underwhelmed by what it had to offer. It just felt like an enhancement for windows with more features, nothing ground breaking. This wasn't a major leap in technology like going from fax's to email. Tech companies releasing new (free)upgrades and new (free)products is like Nike releasing a new pair of shoes, just something else to add to the lineup. Will it make SOME peoples jobs more efficient, yes. Is it applicable for most people, i have to say no. Nike makes shoes for athletes but maybe 1-2% actually use them for what its intended for. Lets say a company has 20,000 employees, of those employees how many need it for their role or will using it on a daily basis? Maybe 90 % wont. If that's accurate a company will only pay for the 10% that need a user license.

If chat GPT was never released all the mag 7 earnings would still be about the same without it.

Now for the overvalued and overbought. MSFT has a PE of 40, one of the highest of all the mag 7. Your paying $40 for every dollar they earn. Based on their current AI stack im not sure they will be able to beat the current expectations in a big way consistently. MSFT is not NVDA. NVDA chips cost $30k+ each, as much as a low end Tesla. Copilot has a free version and the pro version is $20-$30 per user. Most people at companies are not using this and im not sure this will add to the bottom line very much. That means most of the earnings growth will have to come from the cloud business, admittedly the cloud business has been growing at double digits for a long time but there is also a lot of competition in cloud space, at some point growth will slow as cap ex spending slows. The other thing to consider is what AI costs for these companies. The GPU's are expensive, Data storage is expensive and the energy demand from AI use is very very expensive. At some point AI use, especially from free users is going to eat into the profit margins.

MSFT right now is like buying a over priced Cadillac, yeah it drives nice but its overpriced.

AAPL is also overvalued at 35x earnings. Adding chatGPT to a smartphone and enhancing siri isn't worth the current valuation. The goggles were a bust. No new products on the horizon just same stuff just newer versions. Apple isn't the glamorous high growth tech company it once was. Iphones sales are falling off in China and this will definitely show in the next couple quarters of earnings. Its the Nike of tech stocks. People aren't spending $100 for shoes they certainly wont spend $900+ for a phone. I wouldn't be surprised if Buffet starts to offload shares at this PE ratio.

That fourth industrial revolution is not happening today or tomorrow, we are too early. This is going to take some time.

I agree with Ken Griffin on this, the current AI products on the market are not the revolution many are hoping for, they're mediocre at best. There's too much spending and too much free products for this to add to any company's bottom line. The real winners are semi's, data storage and anything surrounding it.

2024-06-17 17:15:52,Microsoft,MSFT,"Nvidia to get 20% weighting and billions in investor demand, while Apple demoted in major tech fund","KEY POINTS

* Microsoft and Nvidia will likely have a weight of around 21% in this tech ETF, while Apple will be down to about 4.5%, according to Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research.
* The rebalance will be in effect for one quarter, even if Apple outperforms Nvidia significantly ahead of the official date.
* The ETF has about $71 billion in assets under management, so a 15-percentage-point change in the fund equates to more than $10 billion.



[Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/)’s blistering rally will force a major technology exchange-traded fund to acquire more than $10 billion worth of shares of the chip giant while cutting dramatically back on [Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/).

The index that the [Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/XLK/) follows will soon rebalance, based on an adjusted market cap value from Friday’s close. The new calculations show [Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/) as the top stock in the index, followed by Nvidia and then Apple, according to Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research.

All three stocks would have a weight above 20% in the index if there were not caps in place. But diversification rules for the index limit how big the cumulative weight of stocks with at least a 5% share of the fund can be.

As a result, Microsoft and Nvidia will likely have a weight of around 21%, while Apple will fall sharply to about 4.5%, Bartolini said.

That is a change from the prior weightings, which saw Nvidia’s weight be kept artificially low by index rules. As of June 14, Microsoft and Apple were both at about 22% each in the fund, while Nvidia was just 6%.

  
The race to finish in the top two came down to the final day. As of Monday, market cap data from FactSet shows that all three companies are over $3.2 trillion and within $50 million of each other, though that data does differ slightly from the calculations used in the index.

The XLK has about $71 billion in assets under management, so a 15-percentage-point change in the fund equates to more than $10 billion. SPDR does not comment on specific trading strategies around rebalances.

The big shift in the XLK is an extreme example of how even passive index funds can diverge, especially when focusing on narrow slices of the market.

“Understanding how they might be weighted, where they’re allocated, what the rebalance frequency is, is really important because it can create differences in exposures and make what’s beneath the label seem different from fund to fund,” Bartolini said.

The fund follows the Technology Select Sector Index from S&P Dow Jones Indices, which uses a float-adjusted calculation to determine market cap. The rebalance officially takes effect at the end of this week.

The free-float adjustment for market cap accounts for large holders of an individual stock that are unlikely to be trading on a daily basis. For example, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway owns more than 5% of Apple, which could count against it in the index, Bartolini said.

“Its free-float market capitalization is reduced because you have so many controlled interests in the company,” Bartolini said.

The rebalance will be in effect for one quarter, even if Apple outperforms Nvidia significantly ahead of the official date.

On Monday, shares of Apple were up 1.8%, while Nvidia ticked up 0.2%.

2024-06-11 02:29:03,Microsoft,MSFT,Riding the MSFT Rocket ,"Riding the MSFT Rocket 🚀 

Alright, here’s 2 cents on MSFT 

**Current Play** 

MSFT is hanging out at $427.87, flirting just below its recent peak of $433.60. The 50-day moving average is chillin' at $414.55, while the 200-day is holding down at $395.67. Volume’s spiking, and you know what that means someone's loading up heavy! 

**Analyst Chatter** 

**Analysts are bullish on Microsoft:** 

* Goldman Sachs reaffirmed their “buy” rating with a target of $460. 
* Morgan Stanley is rating it “overweight,” targeting $450. 
* JP Morgan set a $455 target, taking a neutral stance. 
* Barclays raised their target to $470, maintaining a “buy.” 
* Credit Suisse is holding steady with a $445 target. 

Overall, 30 out of 35 analysts recommend a “buy,” with an average target around $460. The general sentiment is bullish, focusing on Microsoft’s advancements in AI and cloud computing. 

**Financial Pulse** 

**Microsoft’s financials are rock solid:** 

* Earnings Per Share came in at $11.01, beating expectations. 
* Revenue: $56.2 billion, up 11.3% year-over-year. Big boy numbers. 

**Key ratios to note:** 

* Debt-to-Equity Ratio: 0.40. 
* Profit Margin: 33%. 
* Return on Equity: 35%. 

These figures highlight Microsoft’s robust growth and profitability. 

**Insider Moves** 

**There’s been some notable insider trading:** 

* Satya Nadella, CEO, sold 59,907 shares in May, likely cashing in on gains. 
* Amy Hood, CFO, sold 20,000 shares. Total insider sales have reached about $40 million in the past quarter. 

Despite these sales, insiders still hold significant shares, signaling continued confidence. 

Institutional Maneuvers 

**Big institutional players are bullish:** 

* BlackRock added 1.2 million shares. 
* Vanguard Group increased their stake significantly. 
* Renaissance Technologies boosted their position by 5%. 
* T. Rowe Price now holds $6.5 billion worth of MSFT shares. 

These moves show strong institutional confidence in Microsoft’s future. 

**Major News and Tech Developments** 

**Several key developments are pushing Microsoft forward:** 

**AI and Cloud Expansion:** Microsoft is aggressively expanding its AI and cloud capabilities. They’ve introduced Copilot, an AI-driven tool within Microsoft 365, which automates routine tasks and provides advanced analytics. This tool is expected to enhance user productivity significantly. 

**OpenAI Partnership**: Their deepening partnership with OpenAI is a major catalyst. Integrating advanced AI models from OpenAI into Azure positions Microsoft as a leader in AI-as-a-service. They’ve also launched ChatGPT Enterprise, offering secure and scalable AI solutions for businesses. 

**Quantum Computing:** Microsoft’s investment in quantum computing through Azure Quantum is promising. This technology is expected to tackle complex problems more efficiently than classical computing, potentially revolutionizing fields like logistics, cryptography, and pharmaceuticals. 

**AI Hardware Advances:** Microsoft is working on a custom AI chip, Athena, to enhance AI applications’ performance across their cloud infrastructure. This should reduce reliance on third-party chips and lower costs. 

**Cloud Services Growth:** Azure’s growth continues, driven by new enterprise customers and expanded services in data analytics and cybersecurity. Microsoft’s cloud services are pivotal for the digital transformation of businesses worldwide. 

# Apple’s Flop

Apple just had an epic fail, folks. Their AI event was a total disaster, and it’s got people rethinking their game plan. Here’s the tea:

* **Lackluster AI Unveil:** Apple tried to flex their new AI features, but it was a major letdown. They barely brought anything new to the table. The crowd reaction was like, “Seriously, Apple? That’s it?”
* **Tech Flops:** The live demo was a nightmare. Siri couldn’t handle basic commands without lagging or outright failing. Imagine trying to show off your new tech, and it glitches right in front of everyone. Cringe city.
* **Market Reaction:** Investors weren’t having it. Apple’s stock took a 3% dive today as people dumped shares faster than you can say “AI fail.” Wall Street’s questioning whether Apple can even hang in the AI race now.
* **Missed Opportunities:** Apple didn’t announce any major AI collaborations or breakthroughs, leaving the impression that they’re playing catch-up instead of leading the charge.
* **Consumer Backlash:** Social media is roasting Apple’s presentation, with memes and complaints about how underwhelming it was. Not the kind of viral you want.

Looks like Microsoft is poised to steal the AI crown while Apple scrambles to get their act together. With MSFT’s solid AI strategy and Apple tripping over their own feet, this is a prime time to bet on Microsoft pulling ahead.

**My Strategy** 

**Technical Setup:** 

* 50-Day Moving Average: $414.55. 
* 200-Day Moving Average: $395.67. 

**Entry Points:** 

* Short-Term: I’m looking to enter around $420.00, which aligns with support and offers a solid risk/reward ratio. 
* Long-Term: If it drops to the 50-day MA at $414.55 or below, it’s a strong buy for long-term holding. 

**Exit Strategy:** 

* Short-Term Gains: I’m targeting an exit around $460.00, in line with average analyst targets. 
* Long-Term Hold: I’m aiming for a higher exit around $470.00, which aligns with Barclays’ more bullish target. 

**Risk Management:** 

* Monitor Financial News: I’ll keep an eye on AI and cloud computing updates and any new tech releases. 
* Adjust Stops: I’ll raise the stop-loss level as the stock price rises to protect gains. 

**The Bottom Line** 

Microsoft’s push into AI, cloud computing, and quantum computing, combined with strategic partnerships and new tech developments, positions it well for growth. With entry points around $420.00 and exit targets between $460.00 and $470.00, MSFT looks set for solid gains. I’ll stay updated on financial and tech news to maximize the potential from this trade. 

Here’s to making smart moves! 🥂

2024-06-09 15:11:21,Microsoft,MSFT,Bear Case: Why I believe Alphabet will do everything right and still lose,"Alphabet will excel in the AI and automation sectors, but the resulting industry shift will be a net loss for the M7 company as AI eats into its search revenue.

With the ""Attention is all you need"" paper Alphabet has already etched itself into AI history. Its cloud computing arm is keeping up with AWS and Azure. Waymo threatens to eat Tesla's lunch. Its TPU may very well knock Nvidia off its perch.

But even if all that happens, it won't make up for the losses to its search business when AI chatbots take over many of the functions of search. Despite all the efforts into diversification, more than half of Alphabet's revenue still comes from search. So if people turn to Chat-GPT instead of Google as the primary web surfing tool, Alphabet will take a big hit to its most important segment. If GPT can give me the results I want, plus summaries and links and review aggregates, all on voice command, why would I ever need to go on Google and get exposed to its sponsored results? The OAI partnership with Apple may signal the beginning of this shift.

Much of Alphabet's valuation comes from its ridiculous dominance in search. All of its other ventures face stiff competition from other M7 companies and OAI, and I have a hard time believing Alphabet will crush them the way it crushed Yahoo.

Ultimately, Alphabet stands to lose heavily early in the AI revolution. The company will survive, but without a massive moat in a crucial industry, it may go the way of Netflix and lose its elite status among the likes of META, MSFT, and NVDA.",286,245,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1dbvyv3/bear_case_why_i_believe_alphabet_will_do/

2024-05-24 13:50:05,Microsoft,MSFT,Moving on from AAPL,"So, I had an excellent ride on AAPL for a good long bit, but bit a bit Meh on it concerning it's YTD performance , and what I see as a lot of lackluster reviews of it's recent product offerings and choices.  Thinner ipad, who cares?  New chip, no software yet to take advantage of it probably for the better part of a year.  Virt Reality, no killer app to drive it.  AI, they seem to be late in their development, although Apple has always been the greatest at their catchup/surpassing game.  I think there maybe better options for me, looking for a sounding board.  Still looking to keep it in steadily plodding behemoths for ease of mind, but something better than flat YTD performance i got out of apple this year.

First up MSFT, up 14% YTD, has a wide moat, seems to be well positioned for AI, although their gaming sector is looking kinda soft to me.  Like their latest offerings in pc with infused AI, and tablet.

Next up AMZN, up 21% YTD, also a wide moat, with a lot of stability in their supplied items and businesses.  Nothing really lights up the sky, just plodding along.  I think they have an AI strength used in their background business, but has an appearance of hiding, as it has no consumer face to it.

Lastly NVDA, up 110% YTD.  They are definitely the star of the moment, and I think there is still gas in this tank, but being a hardware vendor mostly with some software driven solutions for AI for their platform alone, they may have locked up a good lead that will only grow.

Looking at doing a 50/25/25 split (MSFT/AMZN/NVDA), thoughts?  Would love to hear any positive or negative on this.

2024-05-08 07:22:15,Microsoft,MSFT,Amazon breaks into Europe 5G networks with Telefonica cloud deal,"STOCKHOLM, May 8 (Reuters) - Telefonica Germany (TEF.MC) will move one million 5G customers to Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud later this month, company executives told Reuters, in a bold move by the U.S. online retailer to break into the global telecoms market.

While some telecom networks have moved IT and other non-core operations to the public cloud, the move by the subsidiary of Spanish group Telefonica is a global first where an existing mobile operator is switching its core network to a public cloud.

Big cloud-computing services firms such as Amazon (AMZN.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) have been trying to move more into the telecoms sector, lured by billions of dollars in potential revenue, but operators have been wary of the capability of public clouds in handling a mobile network.

""I want to see it working for at least one to two quarters and have a roadmap to move at least 30-40% of my customer base by 2025-2026,"" said Mallik Rao, Chief Technology & Information Officer at O2 Telefonica, also known as Telefonica Germany.

The company has 45 million customers in Germany.

AWS and O2 Telefonica did not disclose financial details of the deal.

The core network, which consists of high-performance servers in data centers, is the heart of a mobile network that securely routes data and calls at high speeds. A public cloud will cut costs, increase scale and allow repairs to be done without service disruption.

U.S.-based Dish (DISH.MX), which built its mobile network from scratch, became in 2021 the only telecom company to use AWS cloud for core network.

""Dish was much easier because they had no existing systems that had to be modified to work with the cloud,"" AWS vice president Jan Hofmeyr said in an interview.

Nokia, which also worked with Dish, will provide the software and AWS will provide its infrastructure for Telefonica.

Telefonica first worked with AWS and Ericsson, and then swapped to Nokia and AWS, Rao said. ""The days of trial are over. I don't want to keep on trying.""

The global telecom cloud market is expected to reach $108.7 billion by 2030 from $19.7 billion in 2021, making it a growth driver for companies such as Amazon.

""We want to make it a business to run telco workloads,"" AWS' Hofmeyr said, adding that the company expects more deals with other operators in the next 12 months.

""I would say in most cases the discussion is about timing versus should we move into the cloud.""

2024-04-25 20:06:39,Microsoft,MSFT,Microsoft earnings are out – here are the numbers,"Microsoft shares rose 5% in extended trading on Thursday after the software maker issued fiscal third-quarter results that outdid Wall Street’s expectations. 

Here’s how the company did in comparison with the consensus from LSEG: 

Earnings per share: $2.94 vs. $2.82 expected

Revenue: $61.86 vs. $60.80 billion expected

Microsoft’s total revenue grew 17% year over year in the quarter, which ended on March 31, according to a statement.

During the quarter, Microsoft introduced Surface PCs with a key for quickly accessing the Copilot chatbot. The company started selling access to the Copilot for small businesses with Microsoft 365 productivity software subscriptions and hired Mustafa Suleyman, co-founder of artificial intelligence lab DeepMind, to run a new Microsoft AI group. Suleyman had been co-founder and CEO of startup Inflection, and many of its employees also joined Microsoft.

“We have been operating with speed and intensity and this infusion of new talent will enable us to accelerate our pace yet again,” CEO Satya Nadella wrote in a memo about the Inflection deal, which was reportedly worth $650 million.

This marks the first full quarter for sales of the Copilot add-on for commercial Microsoft 365 customers. In a note on Sunday, analysts at Piper Sandler warned clients not to expect many financial details from Microsoft.

So far this year, Microsoft stock is up 4%, while the S&P 500 index has gained about 5%.

I would think that tech company with 46% year over year growth, MSFT backing, and almost billion dollars in revenue would have some kind of buzz going for it. (Growth numbers are taken from Meritech article. It actually  states 47% year over year cloud subscription ARR. Revenue is over 600 million, so it's not really close to 1 billion. The company is also running over 350 million dollar Net Loss. I was being facetious. I attached a link to S1 and article show case the descripencies as to you see in articles and what actually filed. And so you can see the info quickly yourself)

2024-04-07 20:21:45,Microsoft,MSFT,134 S&P 500 index stocks that have beaten the S&P 500 index,"I wanted to identify stocks that are in the Standard & Poor's 500 (S&P 500) index whose total return (with dividends reinvested) has beaten the S&P 500 index either since 1993 or since the stock's IPO (Initial Public Offering) if it was after 1993. I used the ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) SPY as my benchmark for the S&P 500 index because the web site I used to make comparisons [https://totalrealreturns.com/n/SPY](https://totalrealreturns.com/n/SPY) needed an S&P 500 index ETF for comparison, and since SPY - which started in 1993 - is the oldest S&P 500 index, I used SPY and that's why the cutoff is 1993.

I used a stock screener to make a first pass filter, looking for the following criteria:

* Included in the S&P 500 index. This limited the cohort to large. profitable US companies that meet the requirements to be included in the S&P 500 index [https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/equities/sp-500-index/](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/equities/sp-500-index/) S&P 500 stocks are available as fractional shares at my brokerage Charles Schwab and at other major brokerages.
*  Pays a dividend and has a non-negative 3 year dividend Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR). Companies that pay a dividend - and particularly companies that initiated paying a dividend or have been increasing their dividend - have outperformed the S&P 500 index and experienced the highest returns relative to other stocks since 1973—with significantly less volatility.  [https://www.hartfordfunds.com/insights/market-perspectives/equity/the-power-of-dividends.html](https://www.hartfordfunds.com/insights/market-perspectives/equity/the-power-of-dividends.html)
* 5 year total return (with dividends reinvested) close to or better than the 5 year total return of the S&P 500 index. This was to help narrow down the cohort to stocks that have continued good performance in recent years, and to exclude stocks that perhaps were outperforming the S&P 500 many years ago but have been lagging the past 5 years. The 5 year total return of the S&P 500 the past 5 years is +94.69% so I used a minimum of +90% 5 year total return as a cutoff.

I then compared the total return (with dividends reinvested) of the filtered stocks and eliminated any that had a total return less than that of the S&P 500 since 1993, or since the stock's IPO if it was after 1993. Each stock was compared head-to-head against the S&P 500 index (SPY) during equal time frames. For example, this is the comparison of SPY vs MSFT [https://totalrealreturns.com/n/SPY,MSFT](https://totalrealreturns.com/n/SPY,MSFT) which had its IPO in 1986, and the comparison of SPY vs NVDA [https://totalrealreturns.com/n/SPY,NVDA](https://totalrealreturns.com/n/SPY,NVDA) which had its IPO in 1999.

I made a spreadsheet of the 134 stocks that meet the criteria. I did this at the end of last month so the results are current as of the end of March 2024. The spreadsheet has the following columns:

* Symbol: self explanatory
* Company: self explanatory
* Total Return: the total return (with dividends reinvested) of the stock since 1993, or since the stock's  IPO if it was after 1993
* S&P 500 TR: the total return of the S&P 500 index (with dividends reinvested) during the exact same time frame displayed for the total return of the stock being compared to the S&P 500 index
* Ratio: the total return of the stock divided by the total return of the S&P 500 index during the same time frame. A Ratio of 2 means the stock had 2x the total return of the S&P 500 index during the same time period. A Ratio of 10 means the stock had 10x the total return of the S&P 500 index during the same time period, and so on. Even a Ratio of 2 is significant because it means the stock had double the total return of the S&P 500 index during the same time period.
* 5 Yr Total Return: the total return of the stock the past 5 years. For comparison, the total return of the S&P 500 the past 5 years is +94.69%
* 3 Yr Div Growth Rate: the 3 year dividend Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of the stock.  The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) represents the year over year rate at which dividends would have grown annually if they had grown at a steady rate over the time period. Steady dividend growth - growth in dividend per share, *not* the dividend yield - is associated with company vitality and is a positive. If a stock has not been paying dividends for at least 3 years the value is blank, but that isn't a negative because it means the stock recently initiated paying a dividend, and that is associated with outperformance. [https://www.hartfordfunds.com/insights/market-perspectives/equity/the-power-of-dividends/\_jcr\_content/root/readmore/readmoreresponsivegrid/mainfullgrid\_1524872/mainFull\_container/highlighter\_copy\_cop/highlighter\_container/image.coreimg.80.1280.png/1711374546518/wp106-8.png](https://www.hartfordfunds.com/insights/market-perspectives/equity/the-power-of-dividends/_jcr_content/root/readmore/readmoreresponsivegrid/mainfullgrid_1524872/mainFull_container/highlighter_copy_cop/highlighter_container/image.coreimg.80.1280.png/1711374546518/wp106-8.png)
* Dividend Yield: the current annual dividend yield

The spreadsheet can be sorted by each column to find the highest or lowest values in each column. I colored the highest values in each column in varying shades of green. The darker the shade of green the higher the value range. I did not use rigid criteria for coloring different value ranges, but looked for natural separation points or certain arbitrary values, such as >3 or >200%, etc.

Looking for stocks that are some shade of green in the Ratio AND 5 Yr Total Return AND 3 Yr Div Growth Rate columns can help identify strong performers. For example, familiar stocks like AVGO, AMAT, MSFT, and LLY are green in three columns, but so are lesser known stocks like KLAC, MPWR, PCAR and others.

The spreadsheet:

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hh20ZoGg9mOamnSMZcdlOWjSIS9ppthhOI-mgQxe\_pA/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hh20ZoGg9mOamnSMZcdlOWjSIS9ppthhOI-mgQxe_pA/edit?usp=sharing)

Yes, past performance is not a *guarantee* of future results, but a stock that has a documented track record of beating the S&P 500 index over an extended period of time is more likely to continue doing so than a stock that has been unable to beat the S&P 500 index over an extended period of time.

2024-03-29 20:03:04,Microsoft,MSFT,Collaboration Alert: MSFT and OpenAI Launch $100 Billion Supercomputer Venture,"ARTICLE TLDR: Microsoft and OpenAI are reportedly collaborating on a massive data-center project estimated to cost up to $100 billion. The initiative includes the development of an artificial intelligence supercomputer named ""Stargate."" While the companies have not officially commented on the project, sources suggest that Microsoft will likely finance it. Stargate is anticipated to be operational by 2028, marking the final phase of OpenAI's AI upgrade. This U.S.-based supercomputer is part of a series of installations planned over the next six years. The projected cost of $100 billion has been attributed to conversations with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Microsoft's initial cost estimates. The project is progressing through five phases, with Stargate as the fifth phase, while Microsoft is concurrently working on a smaller, fourth-phase supercomputer for OpenAI. The focus of the current phase is on procuring AI chips necessary for the subsequent phases.

2024-03-14 12:56:52,Microsoft,MSFT,Tesla (TSLA) DCF Analysis,"***NOTE: NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE***

# Introduction:

TSLA is the world's most renowned Electric Vehicle(EV) automaker, catalyzing the world's acceleration towards Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) Vehicles. TSLA has become the gold standard for what a high-quality EV stands for, all thanks in part to their founder's vision and belief in renewable energy especially during the tumultuous early years of TSLA. TSLA no longer just stands for EV but renewable energy, having branched out into Energy Storage, and Solar Panels.  TSLA hopes to create an ecosystem for renewable energy from charging to energy storage to the vehicle used, all this tied together by dedicated software created by TSLA at every point of contact in the ecosystem. This ecosystem business model has seen massive success as evident from businesses like GOOG, AAPL, and MSFT. I believe the next frontier of growth for TSLA comes from energy storage rather than automotive, however automotive will still account for the largest chunk of revenue for TSLA.

# Market:

TSLA's closest EV competitor is BYD. TSLA has won BYD on almost every front. A country where BYD has managed to wrest control from TSLA is Thailand. So I'll analyze this market specifically to rationalize why I believe this victory will be shortlived.

In Thailand, the top 3 most popular car models are BYD Atto 3, Netta V, and BYD Dolphin ([SOURCE](https://carnewschina.com/2024/01/09/byd-is-bestselling-ev-brand-in-thailand-in-2023-neta-is-runner-up/)).   

|Model|Price|Range|
|:-|:-|:-|
|BYD Atto 3|1.1M Baht|521 km/charge|
|Neta V|0.55M Baht|380 km/charge|
|BYD Dolphin|0.75M Baht|427 km/charge|
|Tesla Model 3|1.59M Baht|513 km/charge|

In Thailand, 60.17% of the population owns a car ([SOURCE](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1027960/thailand-car-ownership-among-consumers/)) with the average car price being about 0.78M Baht. This means that a Tesla Model 3, TSLA's cheapest model is double the average price of a normal car in Thailand. 

[SOURCE](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1030220/thailand-average-monthly-income-per-household-by-region/)) which means that the Tesla Model 3 is a luxury good rather than an affordable commodity for the average household. The difference in price between BYD and Tesla is a full year's worth of income for the average household which leads the price-conscious consumers in Thailand to naturally gravitate towards BYD, hence the popularity of BYD over Tesla in Thailand.   
  
Ultimately, I do believe that if TSLA continues competing on quality and finds ways to cut costs such as directly setting up factories in Thailand ([SOURCE](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/03/05/business/thailand-tesla-factory-talks-intl-hnk/index.html)), it will be able to close the price gap with BYD. As ""people are really stretching their wallets to be able to afford a Tesla. It’s quite a difficult thing for them to do, and remarkable that it’s the best-selling car in unit volume, despite being much more expensive than other high-volume cars.” - 2023 Q4 Earnings Conference

# Revenue:

TSLA has 5 revenue channels, namely “Automotive Sales”, “Services and Others”, “Automotive Lease”, “Automotive Regulatory Credit” and “Energy Generation and Storage sales”. 

***Automotive Sales***

Automotive sales refers to the direct sale of TSLA’s vehicles fully paid upfront.

Elon Musk believes that manufacturing capabilities will be the most important C.A. for TSLA. “perhaps the most important competitive characteristic of Tesla in the future will be manufacturing technology” -  2023 Q4 Earnings Conference. 

When forecasting the Number of Vehicles each Gigafactory can produce, I took into account that Elon Musk recently unveiled in the 2023 Q4 Earnings conference that there is a new revolutionary manufacturing technology that is expected to drastically improve production. He hopes to pilot test this technology at the Texas Gigafactory to produce their low-cost EV before proceeding to replicate the technology in every Gigafactory. “the sensible way to go about things is kind of figure out the core technology of the manufacturing line and then replicate it with improvements throughout the world.” -  2023 Q4 Earnings Conference. So, in my first 3 years, I assume that the growth rate is below historical averages as TSLA tests out new technology in preparation for the launch of the low-cost EV. I assumed that TSLA’s manufacturing technology was successful.  
  
When forecasting %Vehicles delivered, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historical averages  
  
When forecasting Avg Price/Vehicles Delivered, Elon Musk doesn’t believe in price increases to increase the topline. As evident in 2021 and 2022 where Elon Musk only increased prices due to supply chain constraints before bringing prices back down in 2023. In China, Elon Musk ended up cutting prices due to being able to source significantly cheaper batteries there. I assumed that over time as TSLA enjoys sufficient economies of scale, they will only increase prices in line with perpetual inflation.  


***Services and Others***

TSLA provides a few services such as home servicing in certain regions or customers pay to access TSLA’s network of SuperChargers.  
  
Lifetime number of TSLA automobile (Ex roadster) delivered ([SOURCE](https://backlinko.com/tesla-stats))

Assuming that TSLA is properly maintained they can last \~20 years ([SOURCE](https://caredge.com/blog/how-long-tesla-batteries-last)). Opting for less granularity, in my forecast I assumed the total lifetime number of tesla cars remained constant without any churn.

When forecasting Services and Others, Opting for less granularity I assumed that the servicing’s pricing grew following the price of the vehicle in line with historic averages. 

  
***Automotive Lease***

TSLA has 2 types of lease, “Direct Vehicle Operations Lease” which leases out vehicles to customers for up to 48 months afterwards the vehicle is returned to TSLA. “Direct Sales Lease” either granting the customer title of the vehicle once full payment has been made or the customer has the option of refusing the vehicle.  
  
When forecasting Automotive leasing, as prices for TSLA fell in 2023, Automotive leasing as a percentage of Automotive Sales dropped as it is now cheaper for customers to purchase their tesla in 1 lump sum payment. I assumed that following this trend, as TSLA’s affordability increases over time the %Automotive Sales decreases as well before remaining constant in perpetuity.

  
***Automotive Regulatory Credit***

TSLA has excess carbon credit which it sells to competitors.

“It will continue for some period of time, but eventually this stream of regulatory credits will reduce.” ([SOURCE](https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-9-billion-revenue-selling-regulatory-credits-to-other-carmakers-2024-2)).  


When forecasting Automotive Regulatory Credit, given that TSLA does not intend to depend on these credits for revenue, I assume that as a %of Automotive sales, credit will contribute to a significantly lesser amount in perpetuity. This is further exacerbated by other automobile companies accelerating their push towards EVs as countries begin phasing out ICE vehicles. So, more companies begin having excess regulatory credits as well. Ultimately, I believe that leading up to 2030 the amount of revenue contributed by Regulatory credits decreases to a significant level. 

  
***Energy Generation and Storage Sales***

TSLA produces Energy Storage systems e.g. Megapack and Solar Energy related products e.g. Solar Panels which it directly sells to customers.  
  
For energy storage more specifically megapacks, as the world phases out ICE vehicles and begins embracing renewable energy, it leads to a surge in demand for electricity. However, the issue with renewable energy is that “The most common renewable energy sources like the sun and wind are intermittent or have lower baseload capabilities than coal, natural gas, or nuclear sources. This makes it necessary to have a way to conserve excess energy produced during peak hours. This extra energy can then be supplied through the grid or otherwise when the sun is down, or wind speed reduces.” ([SOURCE](https://www.batterycycle.io/why-is-tesla-focusing-on-the-battery-energy-storage-market/)). As an example to elaborate on how much importance is placed on energy storage, China mandates that all renewable energy facilities must store at least 20% of their total output ([SOURCE](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiYquPrkuaEAxXuSGwGHffzBkgQFnoECA0QAw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Ferikkobayashisolomon%2F2023%2F12%2F20%2Fenergy-vault-wins-big-with-gravity-storage-in-china%2F%23%3A~%3Atext%3DChina%2520has%2520mandated%2520that%2520all%2Cgeneration%2520capacity%27s%2520worth%2520of%2520storage.&usg=AOvVaw3WMq0w9-2ka0Cz2kAGbCWX&opi=89978449)).  
  
The closest competitor to TSLA in energy pack is BYD. The TSLA’s megapack is smaller in dimensions compared to BYD and on top of that TSLA has built its own software to be compatible with the megapack hardware with features such as Autobidder (Software to optimize energy trading) and Powerhub.  
  
Right now what's stopping revenue for energy storage is production capacity, TSLA opened its megapack factory in Lathrop to curb this. TSLA has also announced its plans to build a megapack factory in China to assist with production capacity ([SOURCE](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-22/tesla-acquires-land-for-shanghai-megapack-battery-factory)). As an overarching goal for my forecast, I took into account the TSLA master plan 3.  
  
When forecasting number of dedicated megapack factories opened, I assumed that TSLA would open 1 additional plant every 3 years for the next 10 years, to meet the large surge in demand as countries accelerate their push towards renewable energy.  
  
When forecasting Max Output/Factory, taking into account this article on expected output. ([SOURCE](https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2023/11/tesla-megapack-factory-production-limit-solved-and-capacity-will-be-doubled-to-80-gwh.html)). TSLA’s Lathrop Megapack factory can produce 80GWh/Year in part due to them doubling their existing lines and resolving certain issues. Over time I believe that TSLA can massively increase the Max Output/Factory, as TSLA consistently touts their innovations as having an S curve of progression, where progress is slower at the earlier stages before exponentially increasing.   
As a sanity check, in my base case assuming that all Mega packs are still at 4 MWh. TSLA has to produce 406,200 Mega Packs or 81,240 Mega Pack per factory a year by 2038. As of November 2023, the Lathrop factory can produce 20,000 megapack. So, in 15 years I believe it is a reasonable amount of time necessary for TSLA to ramp up their production 4x.  
  
When forecasting %GWh Deployed, I had to assume total output which is a function of max output and the number of gigafatories. I assumed that over the years as more countries begin phasing out ICE vehicles in favor of EVs, there is a larger need to deploy more energy storage so this % increases to a large extent.  
  
When forecasting Avg Sales/GWh Deployed, Elon Musk does not like to increase sales through increasing pricing which was why when TSLA enjoyed economies of scale from increasing output in their Lathrop factory the Avg Sales/GWh Deployed decreased. So, applying this principle of TSLA slashing prices when costs decrease due to economies of scale, I assumed that TSLA continued slashing prices before increasing by the perpetual inflation rate.

# Cost:

“predicting auto gross margins is extremely challenging since there are many moving parts to this equation, some of which are out of our control like the change in tariffs or local incentives to name a few. While the teams are focused on cost reductions, we are approaching the limits within our current platforms.” - 2023 Q4 Earnings Conference. 

  
When forecasting Automotive and Non-Automtoive COGS, COGS as a %revenue for 2021 and 2022 are likely to be lower due to TSLA pre-emptively increasing sales price to deal with inflation. However, in 2023 COGS as a %revenue increased as TSLA cut back on sales price. Going forward, I’ll assume that TSLA tends towards historic pre-covid average. However, in the long run, as TSLA successfully implements their manufacturing technology this % will decrease even further.  
When forecasting R&D, SG&A, and Others, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic averages.

# WACC:

US 10Y T-Bond (1M Avg) = 4.12%  
Beta ([SOURCE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/)) = 2.41  
Stable Market ERP ([SOURCE](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/ctryprem.html)) = 4.60%

TSLA is rated at BAA3 ([SOURCE](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DBAA))  
COD (1M Avg) = 5.72%  
Marginal Tax Rate = 21.00%  
AT-COD = 4.52%  
  
Market Price (5D Avg) = $178.50  
Shares O/S = 3184.79M  
Market Value of Equity = 568485.02M

Market Value of Debt = 4578.78M  
%Debt = 0.80%  
%Equity = 99.20%  
WACC = 15.12%  
  
Currently, TSLA has a very large beta as its stock has increased in volatility in the past few years. However, I believe that this volatility will not persist for very long as most big tech stocks enter a stable stage where their beta tends downwards. So, as a proxy for how low TSLA’s beta will tend to, I looked at other big tech stocks.



|Name|Beta|
|:-|:-|
|Google (GOOG)|1.04|
|Microsoft (MSFT)|0.89|
|Meta (META)|1.21|

Taking the average beta, we arrive at a beta of 1.05. Assuming similar D/E composition and bond rating. I assumed that it took another 10 years for TSLA to reach the stable state.  
  
Stable State COE = 8.95%  
Stable State AT-COD = 4.52%  
TSLA’s stable stage WACC = 8.90%  


# Conclusion:

Ultimately in my base case, I value TSLA at $186.88 per share. I believe that there is still room for TSLA to grow, having such a strong first movers advantage in the renewable energy market means that TSLA is heads and shoulders above its competitors. I believe that the market is undervaluing the Energy Storage arm of TSLA's business, and less emphasis is placed on this potentially disruptive segment of business.

2024-03-05 13:00:28,Microsoft,MSFT,AI Madness and profitablity,"This isn't a post about AI bubble or why the chip and cloud hardware supplier is on a nutty uptrend. Their revenue in cases like NVDA has grew 120%+ YoY with insane profit margin, and since market is short sighted, it makes sense why the insane run. Lot of people kicking themselves for not see this coming, or someone like me who saw it coming but exited earlier because couldn’t value the “shovel” correctly in this gold rush.   
Now lets take a step back and look at this trend from a different angle. Main buyers are the big 5 Google, OpenAI, META, AAPL, AMZN, MSFT (GOMAM).  
In order for your you all to understand my next points we all first have to agree on few basic things  
**1). Companies have FINITE capex amount**  
**2). Every company at the end of the day WANTS to make money**  
**3). Every company wants to find a way to REDUCE their capex and still grow**  
For point #2, the way these company will eventually make money is by selling the products to consumer and business. So in next 5-10 years we will see leap in software and services innovations. We will see so many new small and midsize companies using these applications to build more complex solutions on cloud. Now take your guess who will benefit the most from this? if your answer is GOMAM, thats correct. If your answer is NVDA then you are an idiot.   
I would say point #1 and point #3 go hand in hand, we are seeing lot of capex diverted within the company itself. So to no surprise, GOMAM are already building and some have built their own silicon. Its just matter of time when they start to reduce their exposure to external company. This isn’t to say that NVDA will ever become irrelevant. The point is they will always have to outgrow and justify for GOMAM to spend their capex on them. This is the bet you are making for going LONG nvidia at these valuation. Because again, market is short sighted, they are seeing 6-12 month guidance and pumping.  
Now i am seeing crazy amount of doom and gloom for companies like AAPL and GOOG lately on reddit and also on media. I just have one question, that goes to #2. How do you guys think every software and services that will leverage these new silicon will reach the end users? Think for a second form a consumer standpoint. They don’t know wtf is NVDA, AMD. All they know is smartphones, tablets, wearable, laptops. I am not saying where you should invest your money. I am just saying don’t go with the trend like a madman. if you miss the shovel rush, you can still make plenty of money on factories that will make gold products for end users.   
**in summary,**   
**I see there is more value in going long on GOMAAM (Added AAPL) than NVDA,AMD**",94,78,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b74mw7/ai_madness_and_profitablity/
2024-03-04 19:40:23,Microsoft,MSFT,Speculative Crap I'm Investing In So You Don't Have to,"Alright folks, mega caps and AI are all the rave but there's plenty of rather unknown companies which are growing their earning's at a tremendous rate. My portfolio in 2022 was Costco, Nvidia, Apple, Google and MSFT. They all did beautifully but they're too big for my liking now. Here's the speculative crap I'm investing in now

**1. GigaCloud Technology** \- Is like an Amazon or Alibaba but removes the consumer and does B2B ecommerce, no debt, strong cash flow, P/E ratio still reasonable for massive YoY growth. Already up a lot on this company and earning's coming up Q4 which expecting big beat.

**2.** **Vita-Coco** \- Everyone's all about Celsius or Monster, Coconut Water imo is the next best thing with a growing market, COCO, is the market leader. Summer's here, coming off winter lows and just had big beat in Q4 which normally worst quarter when its cold. Summer they partner with alcoholic brands and all the weight loss craze leads me to believe ppl are choosing healthy drink alternatives.

**3. Braze** \- Companies need a way to stay in touch with their customers, Braze creates a subscription model which handles all types of communication with customers and automates the process. This company is working its way towards becoming profitable. I was watching YT channel who interviews entrepreneurs, saw freelancer making $150k+ a year using the software to help companies so to me that's huge to see in the real world without even having looked for the company.

**4. Draft Kings** \- California and Texas still have not legalized online gambling which those two states alone are absolutely massive. Texas won't vote on it again until 2025, casino's in Oklahoma donate to Texan politicians to help influence keeping gambling out of the state but 2025 imo we see big changes. There's a huge catalyst here and earning's are growing with combat sports massively growing.

**5.** **Sofi -** The numbers don't lie. When rate cuts were plausibly announced we saw a massive jump. This company wants to run when rate cuts come but until then ppl really weary even though the numbers and guidance are phenomenal.

**6. Palantir** \- S&P500 inclusion didn't come after 5 quarters now of GAAP profitability, so in June imo we'll see it happen which is a huge catalyst. The earning's are growing as a we all know. I don't like the P/E ratio but this is a company I'd buy and immediately sell CC's on and keep selling CC""s until reaching my assigned price and repeating while holding long term.

Everyone of these companies imo has strong growing earning's, relatively unknown still compared to what everyone's piling into, and most have major catalysts coming up. COCO has summer, DK has legalization of massive states, Sofi has pending rate cuts, Palantir has sp500 inclusion, at least Braze and Giga about to report and beat as they do Q4 which should act as minor catalysts imo.",541,127,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b6k1qh/speculative_crap_im_investing_in_so_you_dont_have/

2024-02-10 22:08:45,Microsoft,MSFT,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) $171 A good long term buy,"\#AMD’s MI300 chips will be its growth engine for the future and the key reason for buying this stock. While I don’t believe it will get close to Nvidia’s near monopolistic market share of 80% there is ample room for more competitors and AMD will benefit from the AI boom as well.  
It recently upped its guidance for 2024 for artificial intelligence-related revenue to $3.5B up from $2B previously.

$AMD Chief Executive Dr. Lisa Su said she had ""good confidence"" the company will be able to exceed the $3.5B figure this year and the $1.5B run-rate for the coming fourth-quarter. $1.5Bn run rate implies $6Bn in annual sales.  
However, based on Citi analyst estimates, AMD is likely to generate $5B this year and $8B next year from the MI300 - they believe that Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) are the largest customers for the MI300, which was unveiled in December to much fanfare. And with the average selling price at roughly $10,000 for Microsoft and $15,000 or more for other customers, it's possible AMD is purposefully underestimating sales figures, possibly on supply concerns?  
For Q4-2023 AMD results were in line with expectations  
EPS: $0.77 per share, adjusted, versus $0.77 per share expected  
Revenue: $6.17 billion, versus $6.12 billion expected  
Data Center revenue $2.28Bn in line V $2.29 expected.  
Guidance was light:  
Q1-24 $5.4Bn in sales, plus or minus $300 million, V $5.73 Bn expected.  
Flat data center revenue with server chip declines to be offset by AI GPU sales. We saw weak data center revenue from Intel, this is definitely some cannibalization and likely to continue, till AI GPU starts taking a larger share of the pie.  
Client Group - The recovery in PC’s helped AMD’s client group, which rose 62% year-over-year to $1.46 billion in sales, which the company said was boosted by recent chip launches.  
Gaming, which includes “semi-custom” processors for Microsoft Xbox and Sony Playstation consoles, fell 17%. AMD blamed slower console sales, and said it expected semi-custom revenue to decline by a “significant” double-digit percentage in the current quarter. This is a low margin business and drags AMD’s overall margins.  
AMD’s embedded segment, which includes chips for networking, reported $1.1 billion in sales, down 24% on an annual basis.",252,127,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1anrsxh/advanced_micro_devices_amd_171_a_good_long_term/

2024-01-30 21:15:31,Microsoft,MSFT,Q2 Earnings - Microsoft beats estimates as Azure grows faster than expected,"Here’s how the company performed, compared with consensus among analysts polled by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Earnings: $2.93 per share, vs. $2.78 per share expected

Revenue: $62.02 billion, vs. $61.12 billion expected

Microsoft’s revenue increased 17.6% year over year in the year, which ended on Dec. 31, according to a statement. Net income, at $21.87 billion, or $2.93 per share, increased from $16.43 billion, or $2.20 per share.

The company’s Intelligent Cloud segment produced $25.88 billion in revenue, up 20% and above the $25.29 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. The grouping contains Azure cloud infrastructure, SQL Server, Windows Server, Nuance, GitHub and enterprise services.

Within that segment, revenue from Azure and other cloud services grew 30%. Analysts polled by CNBC had expected 27.7% growth, and the StreetAccount consensus was 27.5%. The metric for the previous quarter was 29%.

Revenue from the Productivity and Business Processes unit including Office productivity software, LinkedIn and Dynamics totaled $19.25 billion. That was up 13% and higher than the $18.99 billion StreetAccount consensus.

The More Personal Computing segment contributed $16.89 billion in revenue, up about 19% and more than the StreetAccount consensus of $16.79 billion. The segment comprises Windows, Surface, Bing and Xbox.

During the fiscal second quarter, Microsoft closed its acquisition of video game publisher Activision Blizzard, its largest deal ever. The company also announced custom cloud chips and started selling a $30 monthly Copilot artificial intelligence add-on to Microsoft 365 productivity software bundles.

But layoffs continued. Microsoft’s LinkedIn subsidiary cut around 700 jobs in October on top of the 10,000 announced earlier in the year. Last week, Microsoft said it’s eliminating around 1,900 employees in its gaming unit, or about 9% of headcount, following the Activision deal.

Last June, when shit was taking a dump, our family wanted to buy a home in hte next 3-4 months. So I wanted to limit downside but not give up on upside. MSFT stock was at 240$ then. So I did a collar: bought puts for 220, and sold covered calls for 300 (both expiring Jan 19). Primary goal was to protect the investment to give us cash to buy a home if the price and location was great.   


Fast forward to today - we did not buy the home for various reasons. We are still in the market, and might buy in another 6 months.   


But as you can see from the current stock price (\~390)I lost quite  bit of the upside. The calls come home to roost in 2 days :)   


So what should I do?  


\- Close the position and just tax loss harvest?  
\- Lets the cals get assigned (and pay a huge amount of tax - might be in vain if we don't end up buying a home)

This is the company that actually makes Nvidia's chips (and Alphabet's, and Apple's and many others). I had my eyes on ASML too, but it seems too expensive especially in the light of recent China export restrictions.

JPMorgan released a note today covering Taiwan Semi (TSMC), saying it expects will be back to strong growth in 2024, while the Intel competition concerns seem overstated;

*Analysts, who have a Buy rating on the stock, raised the TSMC price target to NT$750 from NT$700.The investment bank expects TSMC to bounce back to \~20% revenue growth in 2024, led by inventory restocking, strong AI demand, and the rapid expansion in N3.""Looking ahead, we believe N3 is likely to drive strong growth into 2025, while early progress on N2 looks promising, despite market concerns about competition,"" wrote the analysts.While Intel competition has been weighing down the stock, JPMorgan's analysis indicates Intel outsourcing to TSMC is likely to outweigh any market share Intel Foundry takes away from TSMC in the next three to four years.""In the near-term, we expect TSMC to guide for 1Q24 revs to decline only 3-4% QoQ and indicate a healthy demand recovery at 2024 in its upcoming earnings conference, although GMs may remain under pressure due to higher depreciation costs, N3 dilution, and strong TWD,"" added the analysts.*

I've got a margin account with IBKR and can borrow $300k at the moment. So I buy $100k of a blue chip stock that I wouldn't mind holding long term, and auto sell it when it's +2.5%, thus netting $2.5k pre tax. My theory is I'm unlikely to buy at a long term peak, and even if I do, the worst thing is that I've got a big stake In a blue chip. 

My 100k club includes:
Apple
Msft
Meta
Brk
Bhp
Rio

Currently up $10k, done this 4 times (once with an index ETF which I won't do again). Most trades have closed within a weak, I panicked with meta and sold early after it came back , and it then went up n up. Need to stick to the plan.

2023-12-31 13:00:46,Microsoft,MSFT,Portfolio setup,"Backstory. I’m currently invested in about 20 stocks of about 5% each. Mostly a dividend portfolio with positions in mostly what I feel are “value” dividend stocks. Even though I’m up 15% this past year, I’m trailing the market and have gone back and forth on just going 100% VOO (I’m really struggling with my pride indexing). I’m in my early 40s so a minimum’s of 15 years to expected retirement age. 
What I’m considering is selling out of all of these positions and narrow this to 10 holdings at 10% each. The 10 I’m considering are not what I would consider value but great companies. Examples would be: MSFT, V, COST, UNH, APPL, NVDA, AMZN, WMT, MCD, and O.

2023-12-13 15:06:56,Microsoft,MSFT,Electronic Arts (EA) DCF Analysis,"# Introduction:

The gaming industry has been gaining notoriety in the news lately, with the MSFT-ATVI acquisition and the hype around NVDA boosting the stock prices for the gaming industry as well. EA, in particular, investors have been overly bullish on them. I believe that the current EA model of acquiring studios to acquire their IPs is ill-fitted for the gaming industry considering the success stories of other game developers e.g. Riot, Valve, etc all relied on having a champion cash cow. EA's problems go beyond just their business model, their largest cash cow the FIFA series has recently ended its partnership with the FIFA organization and spun off into EA Sports FC, the success of EA Sports FC is uncertain now that the main body overseeing football no longer backs the FIFA series.

&#x200B;

# REVENUE:

There has been a paradigm shift in how EA will approach its business model, EA wants to make players more interconnected. “having more friends and building stronger friendships in our network leads to more time spent playing and connecting. As a cornerstone of our priorities of growth, we will continue to implement these tools across our portfolio” - 2023 Q4 Earnings conference. So, going forward their focus will be on making their large titles feel more interconnected rather than buying new and smaller titles. 

EA has split revenue into 3 tranches,   
“Full Game Download”, “Packaged Goods”, and “Live Services and Others”  
“Full Game Download” refers to virtual downloads of the game released by EA.  
“Packaged Goods” refers to hard copies of the game that EA sells to a third party.  
“Live Services and Others” refers to DLC.

***FULL GAME DOWNLOAD***

When forecasting Games Released, I'm uncertain to what extent EA will execute their new paradigm shift so to avoid making incorrect assumptions I assumed that the number of titles EA released would be in line with historic averages.

When forecasting Revenue/Game, given that management’s guidance was to focus on older and bigger IPs to create a community. I assume that sales of new games grew at historical averages before tapering down to grow in line with inflation.

***PACKAGED GOODS AND LIVE SERVICES***

When forecasting Live Services and Others, I opted to use a nominal Y/Y to reflect the uncertainty in this arm of revenue. As Live Services and Others are only driven by a few popular and older titles e.g. Apex Legends, FIFA, etc. I assume that Live Services grows in line with historic averages as EA figures out how best to grow their community before there is a slight ramp-up in growth and then tapering down to grow in line with inflation until perpetuity.

# COST:

***R&D AND COST OF GOODS SOLD***

When forecasting R&D and COGS, opting for less granularity I followed historic trends and took the historical averages.

***MARKETING***

When forecasting Marketing, “Operating expenses were up 5%, excluding our fourth quarter restructuring charge. Our people costs increased as we continue to invest behind our portfolio, and we also saw higher marketing spend to support new releases.” - 2023 Q4 Earnings conference. I assume that Marketing will increase to an elevated level to support more marketing for older flagship IPs and remain elevated till perpetuity.

***G&A***

When forecasting G&A, given that EA has stated their desire to build out communities rather than developing more and more different kinds of games, I assume that G&A remains constant till perpetuity.

***OTHERS***

When forecasting Others,  I opted to follow historic trends and assumed that it would continue till perpetuity.

# WACC:

***COST OF EQUITY***

WACC = 8.91%

# CONCLUSION:

Ultimately, in my base case, I value EA at $110.76 per share. I believe that EA is overpriced and their IPs are not as valuable as Investors make them out to be, especially after considering the fact that there is high uncertainty revolving around their most successful IP, FIFA. The uncertainty of how successful their main IPs like Apex Legends, Starwars, and Battlefield can be after the shift in business model leads me to believe that the stock is overvalued.

2023-11-26 14:06:01,Microsoft,MSFT,AI is going to kill the Tech Industry,"It’s a story old as time. A new technology hits the world, people want to be part of the new revolution and be the best with the new shiny object. 

Eventually there are too many companies supplying the product and demand focuses on a handful of companies leading to a large fallout in companies values.

Railroad boom and western expansion

First Auto boom

Tech bubble in 2000s

Crypto 

And now it’s in the name of AI.

The power and potential of AI is as beautiful as it is terrifying. Just look at some of these use cases:

[Build tailored “Apps” on Chat GPT](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2023/11/11/openai-will-let-users-build-custom-versions-of-chatgpt.html)

Bill Gates on development of “Agents”:

[In the next five years, this will change completely. You won’t have to use different apps for different tasks. You’ll simply tell your device, in everyday language, what you want to do. And depending on how much information you choose to share with it, the software will be able to respond personally because it will have a rich understanding of your life.](https://www.gatesnotes.com/AI-agents)

While not fully developed yet, as the technology evolves it has the promise to be able to develop whatever you want and connect to whatever you have. If you’re a shareholder of many tech companies this should scare the shit out of you as sea changes lead to the potential for higher churn.

That company you own because there are millions of subscribers that has tailored versions of its product for many industries is about to look pretty antiquated. Have the AI study all the notes in your business and make a tailored CRM with all the best practices for efficient data entry and connect it with my Email. 

Ohh remake my email to be more simple and add tools to make me better at sales. Having difficulty making that tool? No problem go to the AI App Store and subscribe to the best email add-in for sales.

As technology has evolved we have seen basically winner take most markets. Do you really want the 4th ranked GPS on your phone? How about the 3rd best Language Model?

Many companies are creating and launching Language Models right now but as they expand I would assume only a few true leaders will emerge. Will niches develop? Maybe, but remember you can also just upload data to the mainstream ones to give it expertise in what you want quick and efficient knowledge on.

I’d be worried about any tech companies that are “features of AI” not “platforms of AI tools.” A feature would be “we have the best mousetrap” a platform is “we have the best tools to create your mousetrap” and/or “choose from the highest reviewed mousetraps on our AI store”

Even if you disagree with me on the future of tech, we probably agree that the ability to produce new features and products is now extremely fast for large companies and basic tech start ups given output of these models. This means that the supply of code should increase over time which means more tech companies and competition. This is not good for growth and pricing as more hands try to grab their piece of the admittedly growing market pie.

The AI platforms leaders as I see it are: OpenAI, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, ADBE

Potential Platforms:
Salesforce (CRM) with their EinsteinAI application and App Store 

IBM with their AI tools through Watson 

Probably some others

Other comments: 

AI is likely to automate many jobs away and replace some of those jobs with jobs we can’t imagine yet. If true legacy companies that price on a per seat basis will be challenged if they don’t pivot to per usage basis.

UPDATE: Since I'm getting some salty and sarcastic comments, I'll explain my thinking, although it'll likely attract more saltiness:

I'm gambling Microsoft will become the leader in AI given what's happened in the last 24 hours. OpenAI's loss of staff (up to 70%!) and leadership will cause it to go into permanent stagnation and lose its lead (unless they pull off some miracle this week).

 MSFT is perfectly positioned to take over OpenAI's near monopoly on consumer AI in less than a year. They already know how to operate OpenAI's hardware infrastructure and have poached many of OpenAI's employees and leadership.

AI is the ""next big thing"", as big as the PC, the Internet, or the iPhone, and AGI, in whenever year it comes, will be even bigger.  AI hasn't fully saturated all domains, yet, so the full impact hasn't been felt by most people or industries... yet.

People are commenting, ""but it's at ATH"", which is true.  AAPL was at an all time high in late 2006 (if I have the timing right), and then the iPhone happened.

And all that said, this is 1% of my portfolio.  Calm down.  This was for fun.  I was hoping this would be a friendly community.

For those who don't know the Magnificent 7 are: **AAPL, GOOG, MSFT, AMZN, META, TSLA, NVDA.** With a combined market cap of **more than $11 trillion**, they currently make up approx. **29% of the S&P 500's market cap.** 

The 7 giants have gained **71%** so far this year while the rest of the 493 stocks included in the benchmark index have gained 6%. They have also outperformed all other stocks in terms of growth, profit margins and forward EPS growth, and have stronger balance sheets. 

Most analysts expect that the M7 will continue to outperform all other companies until 2025 at least. 

Now I know this is a ""stocks"" subreddit but just like the majority of retail investors, a large chunk of my portfolio is alocated to an S&P 500 ETF.

So I am actually considering instead of DCAing into a broad index ETF, why don't I just DCA into those 7? Maybe even swap META & TSLA since I am not rly a big fan of, with other 2-3 large caps that I favor, like AMD, and ADBE.

Should we expect these 7 to continue outperforming the rest of the world? Should we consider cyclicality?

2023-11-08 18:17:27,Microsoft,MSFT,Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) has tremendous risks. And why GTA 6 is an even bigger deal than you think,"TTWO jumped on news of GTA 6 release, and it may seem obvious, but let's figure out why this matters to analysts so much.

Founded in 1993, Take-Two consists of three wholly owned labels, Rockstar Games, 2K, and Zynga. The firm is one of the world's largest independent video game publishers on consoles, PCs, smartphones, and tablets. Take-Two's franchise portfolio is headlined by ""Grand Theft Auto"" (345 million units sold) and contains other well-known titles such as ""NBA 2K,"" ""Civilization,"" ""Borderlands,"" ""Bioshock,"" and ""Xcom."" Zynga mobile titles include ""Farmville,"" ""Empires & Puzzles,"" and ""CSR Racing.""

They have had a checkered EPS history, with low and wildly varying EPS from year to year.

2021	$4.56

**Sony Acquisition**

Let's make one thing clear - an acquisition by Sony is clearly their only way to return capital to their shareholders.  They have been courted by Sony in the past, and more recently under dubious circumstances it was ""leaked"" that they were going to be acquired by Sony for an estimated $20 billion. This has proven to be false, per Sony. However, Sony is the ONLY possible acquirer of a company like TTWO, and so let's figure out how a sale to Sony could occur.

The most recent sale of Activision to Microsoft gives us the most recent multiple for a potential sale to Sony. Activision sold with a sale price of $68.7 billion, with a TTM revenue of $7.528 billion. This gives us a revenue multiple of \~9.12x.

Bungie was acquired by Sony in 2022 for $3.6 billion, with revenue of only $200 million, implying a multiple of 18x. This comes with a heavy asterisk of analysts saying that they vastly overpaid, which is true by our other examples below.

Zynga was also bought by TTWO for $9.5 billion on $2.8 billion of revenue, giving us a multiple of 3.4x.

Epic Games' June 2020 financing valued it at $17 billion based on an estimated $5 billion in revenue, which is also a 3.4x revenue multiple.

Electronic Arts trades at approx a 4.5x revenue.

Playdemic was acquired by EA for $1.4 billion, with revenue of $211 million in revenue, giving us a multiple of 6.6x.

If we were to assume that TTWO sells to Sony based on their TTM revenue of $5.35 billion with a floor multiple of 3.40x and a high multiple of 9.12x, this gives us potential sales prices of between $18.2 billion and $48.8 billion, quite a range but plenty of more room on the upside. Compare this with their current $22.8 billion market cap.

However, there are a few things wrong with this assumption, namely GTA 6 and Sony itself.

Firstly, the multiples we established were based on TTWO's TTM revenue, which doesn't take into account a massive title release like GTA6 that would not be captured in their revenue. In fairness, neither does any of the other mulitples we used. However, I would ask you about Epic Games, Zynga, EA, Bungie, and even Activision... did they have any titles coming out (before their sale) that are as hotly anticipated as GTA6? The answer is no, and so I think it is fair to not give as much weight to the floor as we should to our ceiling price.

Secondly, and most importantly, a potential sale can only occur if Sony has the resources to fund it. And my fat conclusion is **no. They cannot buy it.** Firstly, while the MSFT acquisition of Activision has opened up the acquisition from the regulatory side, Sony simply does not have the funds or the ability to acquire it. They only have a cash balance $14 billion.

And if you don't believe me, their CFO stated their company has only around $5 billion left to spend for acquisitions, which means they are most likely in the hunt focusing on smaller studios. They don't have the warchest of MSFT.

What this means for TTWO is that they have no possible exit unless Sony's cash pile swells to a significant degree, because there are simply no other possible acquirers. And importantly, TTWO **simply does not generate significant free cash flow to their shareholders.**

TTWO has to rely on cash flow generated from operations because they will not have a reasonable exit in the next 5-10 years. This means GTA6 and their other upcoming titles have to do a lot of work to bide them time for a Sony acquisition. No one thinks GTA6 is going to flop, but this industry has been mired in flops the last few years from major studios.

Don't take it from me, take it from their 10-K:

""Grand Theft Auto and certain of our other titles, such as Red Dead Redemption or NBA 2K, are ""hit"" products and have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our revenue. Grand Theft Auto products contributed 14.6% of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, and the five best-selling franchises (including Grand Theft Auto), which may change year over year, in the aggregate accounted for 52.9% of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023. If we fail to continue to develop and sell new commercially successful ""hit"" titles or sequels to such ""hit"" titles or experience any delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of our ""hit"" titles or their sequels, our revenue and profits may decrease substantially, and we may incur losses.""

**Conclusion:**

GTA 6 is even a bigger deal than you think. If this flops, they don't make money. TTWO right now is a bet on GTA 6, full stop because they have no alternative but to continue independently, with no prospect of any suitors. They have to continue to deliver on big titles every single year.

Their historical EPS doesn't suggest a market cap of anywhere near $24 billion, even taking into account post GTA 5 years. There is tremendous risk at these prices in this company, it assumes they will never produce a flop.

2023-10-06 16:53:26,Microsoft,MSFT,43 years old and I just invested in stocks for the first time in my life,"Hi everyone!

I decided to post here because I'm anxious, scared, and excited at the same time because I finally saved up some money and invested it for the first time.  I quit drinking beer and buying useless crap, and saved up (don't laugh) $1,000 dollars and had it sitting there in a credit union with pennies for interest and I didn't like that.  

I'm really kicking myself for not doing this when I was younger.  I remember when I was in my mid 20's ""this close"" to making a brokerage account and getting started, and I never did it.  Did this scare any of you the first time you got in to trading?  

The first share I bought was 1 full share in the Vanguard VGT ETF.  I know it sounds dumb, but it was pretty scary and exciting at the same time.  My position is focusing 80% ETFs and sprinkle in some individual stocks to play around with.  

My primary goal is dividends and compound reinvesting, in the hopes that I can have a nice-ish passive income 20-30 years from now.  I'm wondering what you guys think of my current positions:

**ETFs:** VGT, VONG, VTI, SCHD, and SCHG

**Stocks** *(I bought fractions of these)*:  AAPL, AMZN, HD, JNJ, KO, MSFT, NVDA, O, RTX, WM, WMT

That was my attempt of diversifying.  I have been reading until my eyes bleed, and I really have no idea if what I'm doing is considered smart or not.  But for the first time, checking my portfolio today.. seeing I'm up 1.24% with everything in green (short of stupid Wal\*Mart)...  

I'm up a whopping $10!  And I think that's pretty cool!!!  Now how in the hell do I make that **bajillions**?

2023-09-19 14:43:10,Microsoft,MSFT,I started investing in March 2019 and every year I'm in the red. What would you do?,"A couple days ago there was a post about your biggest wins. Some users turned 45k into 1.1m or how they invested in amc and made retirement level money. 

[https://i.imgur.com/RKHteqB.png](This is how my portfolio looks like vs sp500 since March 2019)

* 2019: +78%
* 2020: -9.43%
* 2021: 1%
* 2022: 0.67%
* 2023: -10.65% Ytd (mostly etf, energy and tech) 

I started investing in individual stocks and etfs with the strategy of ""taking profits if it looks too good and selling off if I lose more than 50%""

My major trades:

- sold 50 tsla with 200% in 2020. It looked too good to be true especially when the whole economy was contracting due to covid. Luxury tech cars would be the first to go. If I had waited 2 years it would be +2000%. 
- bought 2x inversed sp500 in January 2020 but forgot that 15% unemployement and all the shops closed is  like nothing for US economy. A milion deaths here and there doesn't change anything. 
- bought 100 GME in 2019 and sold them for a loss just before the short squeeze because the stock has been on a downfall ever since. I hoped for a pivot of the whole strategy of gamestop for more than a year and finally sold not seeing any upward movement. Instead of +3800% got -27%
- BYND -92%. I broke my rule here because I was on holidays when it dropped. 
- Sold CDR before Cyberpunk release and got +120% because I knew it will be reciebed badly by critics but then bought back ""at sale"" shortly after the fall and sold at a loss seeing how it trends down. 
- sold 100 NVDA in 2020 with +60%. Now it would be  +1000%

My overall realized gains is  -$8,000 and ytd is -15%

There is no hope at all for me. I tried to understand the stock market and can't. Since 2020 there is no logic. Penny stocks are doing +1000%, strong companies that have positive cash flows and very low liabilities are just cruising or going down. Bad companies not bringing any profits are exploding because they are being memes.

And I dont know what to do because it looks like the stock market will be flat for the next couple of years and interest rates for real estate are so humongous I don't qualify. I thought the stock market is the way to park money but this + inflation = I'm losing money left and right.

2023-09-11 13:37:17,Microsoft,MSFT,"Stick with my ""Magnificent 7"" (well 5) or move to QQQ?","Hey all, I retired recently at age 55 and have been pondering about my investment strategy for the coming years. Specifically, I'm caught between rebalancing my current tech-heavy portfolio, adding AAPL to the mix, or just simplifying life by moving everything into QQQ. 

This particular portfolio makes up around 30% of my total retirement savings, and I plan to start drawing it down slowly in about 2 years.  
  
My Current Portfolio

  
MSFT: \~75%  
AMZN: \~9%  
NVDA: \~8%  
TSLA: \~6%  
GOOG: \~1%  
Some Context:  
I earned my MSFT shares during my career there and am pretty bullish on their future, hence the big slice of the pie they occupy. I added the TSLA in 2016 and sold a few when it had a big gain but again I'm bullish on them. Most of the stocks have been held for at least 3 years.  
  
So, what are your thoughts?  
  
Should I rebalance these existing stocks?  
Should I consider adding AAPL to diversify a bit within the tech sector?  
Or should I just move it all into QQQ for ease of management?

  
Just seeking opinions.

&#x200B;

If I don't simplify now I will need to in the coming years. I have a couple of years of cash equivalents available and will rebalance annually.

&#x200B;

I'm not keen to just put it all in in an S&P tracker or whatever as I believe tech will out perform for the foreseeable future. Also much of the rest of my retirement fund is well diversified in managed funds I can't touch yet due to tax/age.

2023-09-04 19:40:02,Microsoft,MSFT,Wouldn't it be much more logical to swing trade in Roth IRA's and long-term hold in regular accounts instead of the exact opposite?,"Wait a second before you have a meltdown over this. Hear me out, then tell me that I'm a dumbass.

It's my belief that most people turn into the Boglehead types over time because of their experiences with paying taxes on short-term capital gains and long-term capital gains. Newer investors don't have the experience with dealing with their taxes as much, so they tend to swing for the fences with shorter-term positions.

More seasoned investors tend to buy and hold, but this is a learned behavior because they know that their absolute worst case tax scenario on a long-term gain is 20 percent (federally). Of course, you only pay the 20 percent on long-term cap gains if you're income is over like 492k or something. Most end up paying about 15 percent federal tax on their long-term cap gains. Short-term cap gains seem to be taxed almost double that amount, obviously it depends on your exact tax bracket situation, but you get the point.

Thus, it's been beaten into the heads of seasoned investors that it's just smarter in the long run to hold positions for at least a year, because your tax bill is often cut in half, or almost in half. You do this long enough, and it becomes ingrained in your investing personality.

All of this makes perfect sense to me.

Ok, now let's talk about Roth IRA's. With Roth IRA's, if you're doing things correctly, there's ZERO taxes on your earnings when you're taking your money out. Obviously you need to be 59 1/2 years old and you need to have passed the 5-year rule, etc., etc.

But if ultimately there's no tax implications whatsoever for investments that are under the Roth umbrella, why do most people tend to hold things for the long-term, and be ultraconservative?

**WAIT!**

I already know what you're going to say, but I'm going to argue that it's nonsensical. You're going to say because Roth IRA's are designed for retirement, and when you get up to that age you should be a lot more risk adverse, because you really need this money for your retirement and you can't be screwing around, taking penitentiary chances.

However, here's my argument to that. Consider all of your investments, Roth and normal brokerages as this large bucket of water. Most ~~people~~ investors will have a Roth account and a regular brokerage account. Due the limitations on how much you can get into a Roth each year, it's likely that most people will have at least 5 to 6 times as much money in their regular brokerage accounts as their Roth accounts. For example.... Imagine somebody has 50k grand total in various Roth accounts. Maybe a standard issue Roth and a 401k Roth. But they have 250k in a ""normal"" brokerage account.

In this scenario, less than 17 percent of their overall investment money is in their Roth. So, the argument that they need to be ULTRA CAREFUL WITH THEIR ROTH MONEY is pretty illogical, because it's such a small percentage of their overall scenario.

**Wouldn't it be tremendously more logical to actually trade that 17 percent of their account more aggressively, when it's the only 17 percent that isn't negatively affected by moving in and out of stocks?**

Think about the guy that has Microsoft stock. Been holding MSFT for years. He knows the ups and downs. The peaks and valleys. He can probably tell you countless times he would have taken profits if only there wasn't a major tax consequence. So, he doesn't take profits when the stock gets ahead of itself, and then buy back in during a retracement. But his reasoning is tax implications. Inside a Roth, there's no tax implications. Thus, this same investor could sell out of MSFT when he thinks it's gotten ahead of itself, and then buy back in during a retracement and end up with more overall shares. All with no taxable implications whatsoever.

Now obviously, nobody can predict the future and sometimes people are going to get it wrong. They'll sell MSFT when they think the stock has gotten way ahead of itself and then it continues to go on a tear and now he can't buy back in and still have the same number of shares.

But by the same token, just talk to any Amazon investor over the last three years. That shit has basically gone pretty much nowhere for a three-year period. So the whole buy and hold forever strategy hasn't worked out that great for AMZN holders. 

It cuts both ways. Don't just cherry pick the example of it hurting.",106,189,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/16a1qom/wouldnt_it_be_much_more_logical_to_swing_trade_in/

July has come and gone for investors, bringing with it a continuation and a new twist on the blistering stock market gains seen in the first half of this year.

The Tech sector (XLK), along with some of last year's biggest losers like Communication Services (XLC) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY), powered the market's rally through May.

July has come and gone for investors, bringing with it a continuation and a new twist on the blistering stock market gains seen in the first half of this year.

The Tech sector (XLK), along with some of last year's biggest losers like Communication Services (XLC) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY), powered the market's rally through May.
[Money doesn't grow on trees]

But over the last two months, one of the biggest concerns among market bears — that the rally had become too concentrated — has been addressed with all 11 sectors in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) logging gains between June and July.

And while the aforementioned stars of this year's rally are still playing a leading role, a surge in oil prices has brought Energy (XLE) into the fold with cyclical sectors like Materials (XLB) and Industrials (XLI) also sitting on gains north of 14% since June as optimism about the economy abounds.

This has left all sectors with the exception of Health Care (XLV) and Utilities (XLU) sitting on year-to-date gains through July.

Combine this broad strength with the bullish year-to-date seasonality stats we've been compiling and the final five months of the year have some powerful tailwinds. Notably, however, Tuesday brings us into August, which has been the weakest month of the year over the last 25 years.

[**Broadening of the market.**](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Cj8RJI9cSQHXtbHDpHlEqQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNQ--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/134ad610-2fe2-11ee-bf6f-1ffefac75b64)

In the table above, we can see that the three leading sectors until May were those that house the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks, as well as the growthier names that tend to be less cyclical.

The Tech sector is home to much of the artificial intelligence trade, including Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA). Apple (AAPL), which is up some 50% so far this year, is also a member of the Tech sector.

Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), along with Meta Technologies (META), is a member of the Communication Services sector.

And even with the rally broadening in recent months, we can see Tech is still doing a lot of the heavy lifting. It may not be a surprise, then, to learn that both Apple and Meta have been positive each month this year. (For Meta, the streak of monthly wins extends all the way back to November 2022.)

Through May, Amazon (AMZN) and other e-commerce plays were primarily responsible for boosting gains in the Consumer Discretionary sector.

In the two months since, brick and mortar stalwarts like Kohl's (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN) have joined the rally, with each up over 50% since the end of May.

Cyclical names — whose fortunes vary more alongside the state of the economy — dominate the components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI).

And inside the index we can also see the game of catch-up taking place.

The latest returns from June to July are reflected on the x-axis in the chart below, while prior gains through May are expressed vertically on the y-axis.

Industrial giant Caterpillar (CAT) is alone at the right edge of the chart — up 29% the last two months after sinking 14% earlier this year. Caterpillar will report earnings on Tuesday.

3M (MMM) and Boeing (BA) are also among top recent returns, while rounding out the top five are banking giant JPMorgan (JPM) and retail leader Home Depot (HD).

Also noteworthy are the few laggards that haven't mustered much the entire year and are camping out in the lower left of the chart.

Consumer Staples (XLP) company Walgreens (WBA) happens to be dead last on the year-to-date list, down 20%. Telecom company Verizon (VZ) and pharmaceutical giant Merck (MRK) are also toward the bottom.",38,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/15ezvef/the_2023_stock_market_rally_got_a_lot_healthier/

2023-07-25 20:08:06,Microsoft,MSFT,Microsoft earnings are out – here are the numbers,"Microsoft reported earnings after the bell. Here are the results.

Here are the key numbers to follow:

Earnings: $2.69 a share. That may not compare with the $2.55 cents per share expected by Refinitiv.

Revenue:  $56.19 billion. That may not compare with the $55.47 billion expected by Refinitiv.

Based on analysts’ projections, Microsoft will close fiscal 2023 with revenue growth below 10% for the first time since 2017. Growth for the latest quarter is expected to come in at around 7%. Businesses have been delaying cloud and software deployments since last year due to economic uncertainty and the potential for higher interest rates.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told employees in May that the company won’t lift salaries this year.

Analysts polled by CNBC and by StreetAccount expect Microsoft to report about 25% year-over-year growth in revenue from the Azure public cloud, which competes with Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform. Microsoft doesn’t report Azure revenue in dollars. The projected growth rate is similar to what analysts expect from Google’s cloud division. Parent company Alphabet also reports results after the bell on Tuesday.

During the quarter, Microsoft built on its broad alliance with OpenAI to capitalize on fresh interest in artificial intelligence, following the November launch of the startup’s ChatGPT chatbot. Microsoft introduced a chatbot powered partly by OpenAI language models to help workers make sense of their employers’ data, and it told developers they’ll be able to build plugins that people can access through ChatGPT, the Bing search engine’s chatbot, and other tools.

Investors are eager for resolution in Microsoft’s arrangement to buy Activision Blizzard for almost $69 billion, which was agreed upon in January 2022. Earlier this month, an appeals court denied the Federal Trade Commission’s motion to stop the transaction. Activision shares have climbed past $92.50, close to the $95 that Microsoft agreed to pay, reflecting optimism that the deal is on track to close.

Microsoft shares have gained 44% year to date, while the S&P 500 is up 19%.

In June, Microsoft said it expected to take a $425 million charge in the quarter to pay a fine from Ireland’s Data Protection Commission after the authority looked at whether the company’s LinkedIn unit violated the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation.

Executives will discuss the quarterly results with analysts and issue guidance on a conference call starting at 5:30 p.m. ET.

2023-07-24 20:21:01,Microsoft,MSFT,Thoughts on ERIC?,"Hi all, happy Monday! I'm seeking to diversify my portfolio and also wanted to break up the SPY, QQQ, NVDA, MSFT chains that always seem to develop here with a company that is less discussed. Ericsson (ticker ERIC) is a communication infrastructure company based in Stockholm currently trading at $5.12 per share at market close. I've been reading up on the company and its expected performance and it seems somewhat positive. 

There are 3 factors that seem to be the primary considerations (this includes my takeaways from the articles, and is not purely fact):

1. Earnings Strength - While the EPS has decreased from $0.73 to an estimated $0.48 over the past year or so, analyst forecasts have been raised after the company beat their expected Q1 earnings by $0.06. 
2. Relative Valuation - The consensus across all the reports I've read are evenly split between a neutral rating on valuation or a positive one. Generally speaking, its current valuation is not quite where it should be, with the general expectation being that it should be valued at $1-$2 higher. 
3. Price Movement - This is one of the strongest indicators that has drawn my attention. The YTD price of the stock has dropped by 32.4%, with a 1-quarter down of 5.1%. The 1-month decline has slowed even more to 3.3%. There is a mix of conclusions here, either the value is bottoming out and will start to climb, or will lead to average price performance over the next few months. 

In my opinion, ERIC seems to be a reasonable, undervalued stock that could prove to be a good short-term holding. What are your thoughts? (I'm still pretty new to investing in general, so constructive feedback on the way I've analyzed this would be greatly appreciated!)

2023-07-11 12:46:44,Microsoft,MSFT,"Nvidia’s stock could fly to $550 amid ‘robust demand’ across the board in AI, analyst says","Nvidia Corp. is benefiting from “robust demand” for artificial-intelligence servers across the board, and that could help extend the stock’s stunning rally, according to KeyBanc Capital Markets.

KeyBanc analyst John Vinh upped his price target on shares of Nvidia NVDA, -0.76% to $550 from $500 late Monday, with his new target among the highest on Wall Street: Above Vinh’s $550 target were one $767 target price and two $600 target prices, according to FactSet. C.J. Muse of Evercore ISI matched Vinh at $550.

Shares closed Monday at $421.80, and they’re up 189% so far this year.

Vinh’s heightened optimism about Nvidia’s prospects comes after he conducted channel checks in Asia. Those indicated strong interest in AI servers that are “not only coming from cloud but also enterprise and from AI startups,” he wrote in a note to clients.

Additionally, he said he sees the potential for Nvidia to benefit from delays related to an Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, +0.36% product.

“Delays associated with AMD’s MI300 are likely to free up incremental capacity in 2H23, while we believe NVDA has secured enough capacity (CoWoS) to quadruple its datacenter revenues in 2024,” Vinh wrote, referring to chip-on-wafer-on-substrate, a type of packaging.


That said, Vinh also boosted his price target on shares of AMD, despite more “mixed” channel checks there, compared with the “positive” ones for Nvidia.

“While near-term challenges associated with delays of its MI300 AI server and stability issues with its PC NB Ryzen Phoenix (7040) could result in near-term risk to estimates, AI server wins at HP/El Capitan, MSFT, and Meta give us high conviction that AMD could see well over $2B in AI revenues in 2024,” Vinh wrote, as he lifted his price target on the shares to $160 from $150.

Chip companies will begin reporting earnings in the coming weeks, and one trend to watch will be how server demand is playing out more broadly. “AI servers [are] seeing outsized demand but appear to be cannibalizing traditional server,” Vihn wrote in his note to clients.

He also flagged overall weakness in China, “with no signs of a recovery, which is limiting the inventory destocking process.”

2023-07-10 20:25:37,Microsoft,MSFT,"Nasdaq 100 Plans Special Rebalance To Curb Dominance Of 'Magnificent Seven' (apple, meta, google, Microsoft, Tesla..)","From https://www.investors.com/news/nasdaq-100-plans-special-rebalance-to-curb-dominance-of-magnificent-seven/



The Nasdaq 100 index is set to adjust the weighting of its 100 components, with the ""magnificent seven"" stocks Microsoft (MSFT), Apple, Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon.com (AMZN) currently accounting for more than half the index's weight.

The magnificent seven stocks largely fell Monday.

The Nasdaq 100 special rebalance will take place before the market open on Monday, July 24, to ""address overconcentration in the index by redistributing the weights.""

The weighting changes will be announced on Friday, July 14. No stocks will be added or removed.

The Nasdaq 100 includes the 100 largest non-financial Nasdaq components.


How Is the Nasdaq 100 Weighted?
The Nasdaq 100 index is a modified market-capitalization index. Market valuation is the largest factor, but with methodology to limit overconcentration.

The seven-largest companies in the Nasdaq 100 account for 55% of the index. It seems likely that this combined weighting will be reduced. It's also likely that there may be notable weighting shifts within these seven giants.

The current weights show that market capitalization is the dominant factor, but it's not the only one.

Microsoft stock has the largest weight, at 12.9%, as of July 7. Apple stock has a 12.5% weight, despite having a $2.999 trillion market cap vs. Microsoft's $2.51 trillion.

Google stock has a 7.4% weighting with the GOOGL and GOOG share classes combined.

Nvidia stock has vaulted to a 7% Nasdaq 100 weighting, thanks to its $1.05 trillion market cap. That's a slightly larger weight than Amazon stock (6.9%), even though the latter has a significantly higher valuation at $1.33 trillion.

Tesla stock and Meta Platforms round out the top-seven members, with weights of 4.5% and 4.3%, respectively.

Just for reference, for the entire Nasdaq composite, Apple stock had an 11.4% weighting as of July 7 while Microsoft was at 9.5%. GOOGL stock is at 5.8% while Amazon and Nvidia are at 5.1% and 4%, respectively. TSLA stock has 3.3% share and META stock is at 2.8%.

How Much Will Nasdaq 100 Megacaps Be Cut?
Based on Nasdaq 100 methodology, the combined weight of the five companies with the largest market caps will be set to 38.5%. The five-largest companies, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Nvidia had a combined weight of 46.7%. That suggests some notable reduced weightings for these names.

Meanwhile, no component outside the top-five market cap companies can have a Nasdaq 100 exceeding the lesser of 4.4% or the weight of the stock with the fifth-largest market valuation. That points to at least a slight decline in TSLA stock's weight.

The official reweightings should be released on Friday, perhaps after the close. That will also include stocks that will see increased weightings.

Magnificent Seven Soar In 2023
The Invesco QQQ ETF (QQQ), which tracks the big-cap Nasdaq index, was up 37.5% in 2023 through July 7. The First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weighted Index ETF (QQEW), which gives an equal weight to all 100 stocks, is up just 18.8%.

This largely reflects massive moves by megacaps this year. NVDA stock has nearly tripled (191%). META stock has soared 141% while TSLA stock is up 123%. AMZN stock has leapt 54.5%. AAPL stock has run up 47% and MSFT stock nearly 41%. Google stock is up a still-robust 35%.

There is some concern that this handful of names is distorting the health of the overall stock market, which is likely what's spurring the special rebalancing.

Will Nasdaq 100 Special Rebalance Affect Stock Prices?
The Nasdaq 100 special rebalance will spur stock allocation shifts among ETFs such as QQQ and mutual funds that track the index. So there could be some one-off gains or losses, perhaps as the planned changes are announced on July 14.

However, the impacts may be modest. For one, the big-cap Nasdaq index is going to adjust weightings, vs. a full addition or deletion. Also, far more money tracks the S&P 500, which is why S&P 500 component changes get a lot more attention than Nasdaq 100 moves.

The S&P 500 index, unlike the Nasdaq 100, is a pure market-cap weighted index.

Most of the ""magnificent 7"" stocks retreated Monday. Nvidia stock fell just 0.8%, while Apple slipped 1.1%. more than 1% intraday. Microsoft stock retreated 1.6%, TSLA 1.8% and Amazon 2%. GOOGL stock sank 2.5%.

The one exception: META stock climbed 1.2%, as Meta's new Threads app topped 100 million sign-ups in less than a week.

Megacaps weighed on the Nasdaq 100, which fell intraday before eked out a gain. The equal-weight QQEW jumped 1.8%.",103,47,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14w58g3/nasdaq_100_plans_special_rebalance_to_curb/

2023-06-21 06:45:44,Microsoft,MSFT,4 Tech stocks benefiting from the AI boom.,"The world of artificial intelligence (AI) these days is overwhelmingly dominated by discussions on generative AI and its implications. Simply put, generative AI is a form of machine learning through which AI software can produce text, video, images, and more. Basically, generative AI can produce any form of content on the basis of prompts. This form of AI became more widespread and renowned after the launch of ChatGPT and similar generative AI platforms, which revolutionized the AI sector while pulling in major tech companies to become part of the AI race.  
  
This form of AI and its impact on the markets was discussed by Jim Stewart, a New York Times columnist, on CNBC's 'Squawk on the Street' on June 16. According to Stewart, big tech companies, especially those that are AI beneficiaries, have been leading the recent stock market rally. These include companies such as Microsoft Corporation ($MSFT), Alphabet Inc. ($GOOG), and NVIDIA Corporation ($NVDA). Stewart claimed that he was bullish on AI, especially considering the fact that this technology could boost productivity gains across different fields, including journalism.  
  
**AI and the US Stock Market**  
In May, NVIDIA Corporation ($NVDA) joined the group of companies with valuations in trillions of dollars. Many financial professionals today are attributing the gains of the S&P 500 to AI, primarily, with the focus being on NVIDIA Corporation ($NVDA) and other big tech companies that have begun incorporating AI and generative AI in their products and services.  
  
This overwhelming focus on a select few number of companies that can successfully play the AI boom and come out victorious has led to many investors worrying that the stock market in 2023 will turn into a selection of a few winners and a lot more losers. The S&P 500 has ""basically been the S&P 7,"" a reference to the fact that only seven major tech companies have been calling the shots so far in 2023, leading the market to heavily rely on them and their gains.  
  
**""You Are At The Starting Line Of AI""**  
This reality has led many professionals and corporations to realize that the AI boom is very real and may be here to stay. Companies today will be bound to figure out where they stand in this environment and how they can integrate AI into their business models to reap the benefits of this technological revolution. NVIDIA Corporation's ($NVDA) CEO, Jensen Huang, in an address at the National Taiwan University in May, stated that we are currently at ""the starting line of AI"" and that at this moment, we should run instead of walking. The implications of his statement are many, but perhaps the most obvious lesson to take away from Huang's speech is that companies and individuals today shouldn't be slow to join the AI race - they should try their best to become part of it and ensure they don't end up getting left behind by their competitors.  
  
Keeping the above-mentioned market dynamics and developments in mind, I have compiled a list of the top tech stocks to consider investing in to play the AI boom. I included the obvious stock picks because of their contributions to this industry so far, but I also attempted to find other companies that wouldn't be the first to come to your mind when looking at AI beneficiaries today. 

# Our Methodology

To select our stocks, I  looked at which companies analysts are expecting to benefit from the AI boom and shortlisted them based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them by using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the first quarter of 2023. The stocks are ranked based on this metric, from the lowest to the highest number of hedge funds long each of them.

# Tech Stocks Benefiting From The AI Boom

2023-06-16 02:14:37,Microsoft,MSFT,Microsoft’s stock hits record after executives predict $10 billion in annual A.I. revenue,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/15/microsoft-stock-hits-record-as-leaders-see-10-billion-in-ai-revenue.html

* Microsoft shares climbed 3.2% to a record Thursday and are now up 46% this year.
* The company could pick up $10 billion or more in annual artificial intelligence revenue from developers using its Azure cloud or OpenAI’s models, an executive said this week.
* JPMorgan analysts raised their price target on Microsoft stock Wednesday.

Microsoft shares climbed to a record Thursday after analysts at JPMorgan Chase touted the software maker’s growth prospects in artificial intelligence.

The stock rose 3.2% to close at $348.10, topping its prior all-time high reached in November 2021, the same month the Nasdaq peaked. U.S. indexes enjoyed a broad rally, following the Federal Reserve’s announcement Wednesday that it would hold off on increasing interest rates.

AI has been a hot topic all year, after Microsoft-backed OpenAI in November released the ChatGPT chatbot, which quickly went viral. Tech companies have rushed to embed the technology into products and features and have boasted their ability to use AI to drive cost savings as recession concerns persist.

Microsoft is a major beneficiary of the rise of ChatGPT and tangential products. On top of its hefty investment in OpenAI, the company provides the underlying computing power. Microsoft also has an exclusive license on OpenAI’s models, including the GPT-4 large language model that can spit out natural-sounding words in response to a human’s text input.

Microsoft has incorporated OpenAI tools into its Bing search engine and even the Windows operating system. At the company’s event in February to announce its Bing Chatbot, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said “it’s an exciting time in tech.”

Investors want to see what it all means for Microsoft’s earnings and revenue.

In April, Microsoft finance chief Amy Hood said she expects fiscal fourth-quarter growth for Azure cloud of 26% to 27% year over year in constant currency, with 1 percentage point of it coming from AI services. On Monday, in a public discussion with Microsoft technology chief Kevin Scott, Hood provided more specifics, saying that “the next generation AI business will be the fastest-growing $10 billion business in our history.”

In the past four quarters, Microsoft has generated almost $208 billion in total revenue.

Scott went deeper on Hood’s prediction.

“Because it really is a very general platform, we have lots of different ways that $10 billion of ARR is going to first show up,” he said. ARR stands for annual recurring revenue.

“There is all of the people who want to come use our infrastructure, whether they’re training their own models, whether they are running an open-source model they’ve got or whether they are making API calls into one of the big frontier models that we’ve built with OpenAI,” Scott said.

Following the event, JPMorgan analysts lifted their price target to $350 from $315.

“While MSFT continues to encounter a broad wave of cloud optimizations weighing on Azure growth, we see it planting the longer-term seeds for success across Security, Teams, Power Apps and now the forward-looking OpenAI/ChatGPT investments,” wrote the analysts, who have the equivalent of a buy rating on Microsoft stock.

With Microsoft’s 46% rally this year, the stock has recouped all its losses from 2022, when investors rotated out of technology in anticipation of rising interest rates and economic headwinds.

Negative sentiment around cloud growth and a contracting PC market led to pessimism on Wall Street last year. But the excitement around AI in addition to the cost-cutting measures that tech companies implemented produced a renewed bullishness. The Nasdaq is up 32% this year, doubling the gains in the S&P 500.",494,97,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14akdu5/microsofts_stock_hits_record_after_executives/

2023-06-09 09:07:00,Microsoft,MSFT,"How US stocks rose 20% from their lows, and where they might be going","U.S. stocks have defied fears of a recession, a banking crisis and soaring Treasury yields to rise 20% from their October lows - one definition of a bull market.  
  
The benchmark S&P 500 index closed at a low of 3,577.03 on Oct. 12, 2022, down 25% from its all-time high after the Federal Reserve unleashed a series of bruising interest rate increases to fight decades-high inflation.  
  
On Thursday, it closed up 0.6% at 4,293.93, amid growing optimism over the economic outlook and a rate hiking cycle that appears to be nearing its end. Here are some features of the index's rally, and a look at where stocks might go from here.

While markets seldom rise in a straight line, the S&P 500's journey from the bottom took 164 days - the longest 20% climb from a bear market low in five decades. Among the factors holding stocks back was a surge in Treasury yields to their highest levels in decades that dulled the allure of equities by offering investors the potential to earn attractive income in government-backed bonds.  
  
A crisis that saw the biggest bank busts since the Great Recession also shook investor confidence, as did worries over a potentially catastrophic fight over lifting the U.S. debt ceiling.

The narrow breadth of the S&P 500's rally has been a concern for some investors, with just seven stocks - Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Meta (META.O), Nvidia (NVDA.O) and Tesla (TSLA.O) - responsible for almost all of the index's gains this year. Many investors view these stocks as safe bets in uncertain times. Their gains were also driven by excitement over advances in artificial intelligence.

More recently, however, the market's gains have shown tentative signs of broadening out to other stocks.

Meanwhile, volatility has subsided - not only in stocks, but in Treasuries and currencies.  
  
One reason for the calm in markets is investors' belief that the Fed is unlikely to deliver many more of the rate hikes that shook asset prices last year.  
  
Investors have also been encouraged by evidence showing that the U.S. economy continues to be resilient in the face of the central bank's monetary tightening, while inflation slowly cools. The U.S. Citigroup Economic Surprise Index (.CESIUSD) shows U.S. economic data has in aggregate topped market expectations, helped by stronger than expected numbers for employment and consumer spending.  
  
A 20% gain from bear market lows has in the past heralded further upside for stocks.

In four of the last six bear markets, the S&P went on to rise 20% or more in the six months after hitting this milestone.

2023-06-05 20:27:12,Microsoft,MSFT,AAPL price dump after VR headset reveal,"The price movement was directly correlated with the VR headset announcement along with the demo of features.

* Yes, it looks like ski goggles.
* The OS is called **Vision Pro**
* The VR OS is similar to Microsoft's Mixed Reality with their Hololens product which came out 8 years ago...

One of the **selling features** is that your eyes are visible, but the headset will conceal your eyes when you're fully immersed in an app.. which may or may not be groundbreaking as it didn't perfectly reveal your eyes (perhaps because there wasn't enough lighting inside the goggles to show your eyes clearly, but I think this could be fixed w/ software or by adding LED lights on the inside edges), however:

* If you can keep your headset on while talking to people in the room compared to the competition, this feature alone would win out

Price tag is $3500, but again this is the dev conference, so the consumer version of this product will come later, although I can see how a lot of developers might want to buy this thing (also consider that Apple has the largest developer network) compared to competitor headsets which cost 7x less (META is coming out with a $500 VR headset).

Something to note, the stock dropped nearly 1.5% during all the free features (before the VR headset) that were going to be included to existing users, however that did coincide with the market indexes dropping as well.

Total drop from the peak was around 3.5% however the stock recovered nearly a percent, today's loss is only around 0.75% after falling from making another new 52w all time high.  Trading volume was 2x the normal average, so ending red is very significant.

META & MSFT stayed relatively flat compared to AAPL.

Overall I think this was bad news for the stock in the short term; buy the rumor sell the news type event.  If the VR headset was truly revolutionary, stock price would have gone much higher, **so we have to wait & see what Apple developers can do with this headset for consumers & what Apple's actual consumer version of the headset will be.**  Than after 12 to 18 months when the killer apps come out, re-evaluate Apple's VR headset.

2023-06-02 16:41:58,Microsoft,MSFT,"The future picks and shovels of AI may not be GPUs but ASICs, following the crypto trajectory. GOOGL and the dreaded Samsung appear to be the leaders in this space. What is the highest-weighted Samsung ETF and what are other industry-leading AI FPGA/ASICs tickers?","For context and a disclaimer, I own NVDA (and AAPL and ASML) in this space, having ridden through the last crash and rebound without checking my portfolio and counting fake money, but I am overexposed and don't want to add to the overweighted positions now. 

I think that NVDA will always be an important company at the forefront of AI research, there is a good chance that NVDA's trajectory could be similar to its performance after the fall of cr*pto for the same reasons. In NVDA's favor, you can read any AI paper, which will be benchmarked on NVDA GPUs, download the requisite libraries, and do it yourself. It is a royal pain to implement algorithms on any other GPU even if you found a programmer with a 5-page blog post about how to do it with lots of particular versions of out-dated libraries, so I own NVDA. CUDA rocks, but NVDA doesn't want to let it out. Metal for OSX is pretty good, but no one uses it and AAPL doesn't do serious system on a chip cluster/cloud computing yet, though they will have an announcement 2-3 years out given Tim Cook's slow feet. For example, we are going to see AAPL AR/VR this week, but he probably didn't shovel out AAPL's piles of cash until FB announced that it was now Meta and that Zuckerberg would be the lord of the metaverse with the most awesome meta-real-estate.

Back to the previous fall of NVDA, you could once pool mine shitcoins with GPUs, I've done it, but that became energetically unprofitable when people found a cheaper way to do it, first with FPGAs and then with ASICs, which require millions and millions more to make work once you know exactly what you need to make. The advantage is that fewer operations occur with parallelizable algorithms, and FPGAs use less energy than do-anything GPU/CPU computations, but they are an expensive pain to program. When you are absolutely done building a better mousetrap, ASICs use the least amount of energy and can perform operations much faster and price-out GPUs in terms of upfront costs (once printed) and recurring energy costs. There was a time when you couldn't but NVDA's best GPUs for gaming because people were using them to mine shitcoins (diclaimer: I own a less than 5% stake of ETH2, and negligible bitcoin, only as an alternative to shit-yield savings accounts, which would be better off in treasuries anyway). I digress. A point came where it was dumb to mine with GPUs because ASICs arrived, and proof-of-work algorithms made it dumb to mine in the first place, which was waste of carbon footprint in the first place. Then, NVDA GPU prices crashed along with NVDA stock, but NVDA was still the machine learning leader. At some point, this will happen to NVDA again. MSFT is already shoveling cash at AMD to build their next AI supercomputer to undercut NVDA prices, but AMD's price is too high right now for me, even when I love tech stocks as I don't plan to retire for decades, and I think AMD won't win with their GPUs in the very long term because of ASICs, even if they make a CUDA-clone language and open source it.  

Years ago, a paper titled ""Attention is all you need"" rocked the AI world and spawned GPT, GPT2, up to GPT4. Given the fifth largest GPU-based supercomptuer, a search engine's worth of data that people gave away, you can build a great AI mousetrap that can do the job students and corporate middle managers and pencil pushers. In a decade or two, programming complex programs with human-levels of bugs and mistakes will be a reality. We have a good mousetrap. Googles TPU v4 supercomputers use optics-based AI ASICs produced and patented by Samsung. I used to be a fan of Samsung, but then new management took over and it has dived off a cliff. Their appliances have the performance of robots bathed in saltwater, and I swore of Samsung phones after using them since forever when they started pushing shit malware games and apps onto my phone with every urgent security update, and every new phone increasingly locked app developers out of the real hardware, so you could use the Samsung app for a camera, but nothing else. But, and please correct me if I am wrong, I think Samsung may be the current leader in AI ASICs. I thinking GOOGL is still behind and their new Samsung-based supercomputer is the wrong mousetrap, but GOOGL programmers have certainly already been tasked with building a GOOGL v5 supercomputer that is dedicated to the transformers that underpin GPT through GPT4. I don't own GOOGL, but I may buy it during market corrections.  

Unfortunately, I don't have hundreds of K for an international account, and the Samsung OTC ticker doesn't correlate with Samsung's price in Korea and I don't trust it. I read about ETFs trying to reduce Samsung's weight, but I want an ETF that is dominated by it. Samsung still makes great sensors, invests heavily in research, and some departments within the fetid bureaucracy are still highly competent. So, please offer any ETF suggestions. I am fine with also investing in Korea's broader tech industry, despite the problems with Asian tech companies and their lagging China-based supply chains and the problems with China deciding that money is no longer free in its state-based kleptocracy economy. 

Please send me any tickers that I can research that may not have caught the current AI wave and that might still be well positioned for large future returns assuming that AI ASICs become the future, which I feel is a given. This might include companies dedicated to programming FPGAs and ASICs.",15,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13yhq75/the_future_picks_and_shovels_of_ai_may_not_be/

2023-05-30 16:13:40,Microsoft,MSFT,MSFT is baking in massive AI revenue streams. Is it really going to boost profits like the hype?,"Long term holder of MSFT here. To be fair I think MSFT is making a good move getting out in front of this trend and getting a big foothold in the industry. However cool the tech is I find it very hard to believe the stock run up is warranted to this level based on what I saw at build. Couple of points I think ""bear"" considering.

1. How many employers are going to pay extra for these features is the near future? My company has blocked most things AI citing fears of client data leaks and misuse. (co-piot, bing chat)
2. How big of a revenue boost will this really be? There is a lot of computational hardware in use behind the scenes. If you have power users hitting this all day how much is being kept in profit?
3. Azure Open AI seems to have some good use cases, but a lot of the demonstrated cases are around chat bots. Are chat bots worth a 35X + multiplier on this 2 trillion plus stock?

My view is more that MSFT has to do this to ensure they stay in the game not that this will be a major major revenue driver. For a company this large thinking PE of 35 is a bit lofty. But then again I've been reminded by some that MR Market tends to throw fundamentals to the wind when the hype gets big and we can grow into this multiplier...it just might be a bit.",41,90,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13vuikf/msft_is_baking_in_massive_ai_revenue_streams_is/
2023-05-25 14:25:03,Microsoft,MSFT,This doesn't feel sustainable for a nearly $1 TRILLION Company!,"tl;dr at bottom  
Not trying to start a debate, I'm not long or short $NVDA, don't own any, and I don't plan to open a position anytime soon, I'm just your monthly buyer of $VOO and $QQQ.  

However, to the bulls out there, what is the reason for such a MASSIVE premium for this stock?  I understand they crushed earnings and increased foecast to a nearly 50% gain in revenue by Q1 2024, but even with that premium, they are trading at a nearly 200 P/E.  

Assuming NVDA maintains that 50% premium and holds it for all 4-quarters in 2024, thats $44B in revenue which if they had 100% margins and zero cost of any kind, it would take you almost 22 years to payback the value of the stock. 

Sure, someone will tell me P/Es don't matter, and they are growing like crazy, but at what point is the value of the stock (again, almost $1 TRILLION) still out of control? 

\- Their Gross Profit is 56% which is impressive, but not unherd of (MSFT is 68%, META is 80%)   
\- Their net income is 16% which is right in line with everyones favoriate not a car company TESLA at 15%

Lets throw out fundamentals since they clearly don't matter that much for this stock and look at their growth:  $7.19B (lower than Q1 2022 of $8.29B).  

Their Q4 22 Revenue was $6.05B vs. Q4 21 of $7.64B

So grow is slower/stagnant from the previsous years, so why does that get such a massive premium?  Did they beat earnings estimates, yes, but those were concervitive.  Did they raise guidance by 50% due to the AI boom, yeah, how long will that last?  Same length as the gaming/crypto/at home boom?  Okay, then what, revenue falls again?

Although their growth rates for azured has slowed to 27% from 31%, the growth rate was still better than expectation. Nevertheless, the CEO Satya Nadella has whetted investors’ appetite during the earnings call by announcing the phase of growth for azure, which is Azure OpenAI. With the success of ChatGPT around the world, businesses are excited on the introduction of the Azure OpenAI, which would lead to further revenue growth for Microsoft.

AI-Integration of their product offerings has kept the growth story strong for Microsoft. Prior to their quarterly earnings release, shareholders were worried that Microsoft’s growth would come to a halt, and that this would sink the share price given that they are still currently priced to grow at double digits for years to come. Through this quarter earnings, Microsoft has proved that they are able to integrated AI to their current product offering successfully.

While Microsoft has produced a stellar quarter, there is still some room for improvement due to the share buybacks and dividend increase not keeping up with their growth. While it is debatable that they are increasing their R&D spend for AI, Microsoft has been generating lots of free cash flow, and they can look into providing shareholder value through higher share buybacks or increasing their dividends.

2023-04-30 19:22:08,Microsoft,MSFT,The Semiconductor/Chip Bubble," Hi everyone,

I want to start by clarifying that this is ***not*** financial advice.

I believe that there is a semiconductor bubble that is anywhere between 2 to 3 quarters from popping.

A combination of growing recession, war, supply chain, and decreasing demand pressures exasperated by overvaluation in the chip space is a ticking time bomb.

# Let's start by reviewing the decreasing demand for semiconductors...

&#x200B;

>WASHINGTON—April 6, 2023—The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) today announced global semiconductor industry sales totaled $39.7 billion during the month of February 2023, a decrease of 4.0% compared to the January 2023 total of $41.3 billion and 20.7% less than the February 2022 total of $50.0 billion. Monthly sales are compiled by the [World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS) organization](https://www.wsts.org/) and represent a three-month moving average. SIA represents 99% of the U.S. semiconductor industry by revenue and nearly two-thirds of non-U.S. chip firms.

&#x200B;

>Regionally, year-to-year sales increased slightly in February in Japan (1.2%), but decreased in Europe (-0.9%), the Americas (-14.8%), Asia Pacific/All Other (-22.1%), and China (-34.2%). Month-to-month sales were down across all regions: Europe (-0.3%), Japan (-0.3%), Asia Pacific/All Other (-3.6%), the Americas (-5.3%), and China (-5.9%).

**Souce:** [https://www.semiconductors.org/global-semiconductor-sales-decrease-4-month-to-month-in-february/](https://www.semiconductors.org/global-semiconductor-sales-decrease-4-month-to-month-in-february/)

The bottleneck for semiconductors seems to have certainly passed, and I would expect to see the balance sheet for semiconductor and chip manufacturers to begin contracting.

# Moving onto war and legislative pressures, I believe that this industry has tremendous exposure to China & Taiwan...

TSMC is the largest producer of semiconductors, virtually all other chip manufacturers rely on TSMC to produce their semiconductors. Additionally, outside of TSMC, many chip manufacturers rely on China for at least part of their chip manufacturing or assembly as well.

I believe that the growing conflict between China and Taiwan may be approaching a tipping point.

Although tensions have been high between Taiwan and China for sometime, a recent Quiver Quant Instagram reel outlines some suspicious trading behavior from Senator Tommy Tuberville as well as Warren Buffet regarding TSMC.

Yahoo Finance Article on Buffet TSM Sale: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-says-unusually-quick-002444050.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-says-unusually-quick-002444050.html)

Quiver Quant Page on TSM Trades: [https://www.quiverquant.com/dashboard/TSM/](https://www.quiverquant.com/dashboard/TSM/)

I believe that this conflict will create a huge supply chain issues for chip manufacturers. I believe it will be a delayed issue, meaning that we won't see the issue manifest for at least a quarter or two on earnings, and I would not be surprised if their first earnings following the conflict is actually stronger, but their forward guidance becomes incredibly poor.

Adding to the bottleneck they may be experiencing with semiconductors, I believe that OPECs decision to reduce oil production will also manifest itself as additional operating costs for the chip manufacturers. The cost to import parts will increase and henceforth their operating cost as well.

Here in the U.S, I believe this will be a stark contrast for us month to month. The government has been able to artificially suppress crude oil prices by dipping into the the national reserve, however, this is not sustainable long term. Once this stops, we'll see a big jump from moderate to high inflation in a matter of days and this will likely shock our economy quite a bit.

# Overvaluation...

I'm specifically taking aim at NVDA. They have a book value of approximately $8.96 but closed the trading day on 4/14/23 at $267.58

That is 29.86x their book value. YTD their stock price has risen 80.18% while their actual book value has dropped from $10.62 to $8.96 YOY from Q4 of 2021 to Q4 of 2022.

To contrast, TSM's price-to-book ratio is 4.72 as of 4/14/23.

AMD's P2B value is 2.70, and just for fun, TSLA's is 13.09

Obviously when we look at the actual price of a stock, we understand that a large degree of a stock's price is speculation. I'm arguing that the speculation in NVDA's stock price is out of control, and that at some point it will return to a more reasonable price-to-book ratio.

I believe in this case, the conflict between Taiwan and China will be the catalyst that will accelerate NVDA's waterfall down into a more reasonable price point.

$YANG Long

$SOXS Long

$UVXY Long

I do believe that after this bubble bursts, we're going to form another bubble, so I'll be looking to reverse my positions at some point.

Specifically I will be looking at INTC and MSFT to lead the next bubble in this sector given their foray into semiconductor manufacturing.",2,57,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1340jmy/the_semiconductorchip_bubble/

# [Stock futures rise after Microsoft, Alphabet post earnings beats: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/25/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> U.S. stock futures rose Wednesday as Big Tech earnings began to roll out, led by Microsoft.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 5 points, while S&P 500 futures added 0.2%, and Nasdaq-100 futures gained 1%.
*****
> Microsoft beat Wall Street’s expectations on the top and bottom lines in its latest quarter. The company also posted a big jump in revenue from its Intelligent Cloud business segment. Shares gained 8% in the premarket. Google-parent Alphabet posted better-than-anticipated earnings, however the stock dipped slightly as revenue grew by just 3% year over year.
*****
> “We’re still early in this season, but it seems like Wall Street generally underestimated corporate America once again,” said Callie Cox, an analyst at investment company eToro. “Company-level information could be easing investors’ fears on how corporate America is handling slowing growth and rising costs, especially given the focus on the job market.”
*****
> “There are a lot of eyes on how well tech holds up given it’s powered the market recently,” she added. “Big Tech has been through a lot of scrutiny, and expectations are already quite low for the sector. We expect Big Tech companies to focus on profitability and cost-cutting measures in their earnings commentary.”
*****
> Boeing, Hilton Worldwide and Spirit Airlines are scheduled to report their earnings results before the bell Wednesday. After the close, Meta Platforms, eBay and Mattel are due to report.
*****
> Traders are coming off a losing session, with the Dow falling about 344 points Tuesday. The S&P 500 finished 1.6% lower and the Nasdaq Composite dropped nearly 2%.
*****
> First Republic Bank said late Monday that its deposits dropped 40% to $104.5 billion in the first quarter. This reignited concerns about the broader banking sector and pressured the major averages Tuesday. Cox called the instance “an exception.”
*****
> “I’ve felt encouraged by how well margins have held up,” she told CNBC. “That’s a function of both sales and cost management, but it shows us that investors may have not factored in how much businesses are benefiting from cooling labor and goods costs.”
*****
> Elsewhere, investors are monitoring durable goods and mortgage purchase data Wednesday morning, before getting the latest GDP update Thursday and the big Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index – the Fed’s favored inflation gauge – on Friday.

2023-04-26 11:20:59,Microsoft,MSFT,Britain blocks Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard,"LONDON — Britain’s top competition regulator on Wednesday moved to block[ Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/)’s acquisition of video game publisher [Activision Blizzard](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ATVI/).

The  measure marks a major blow for the U.S. tech giant, as it seeks to  convince authorities that the deal will benefit competition.

Microsoft said it plans to appeal the decision.

The  U.K. Competition and Markets Authority said that it opposed the deal as  it raises competition concerns in the nascent cloud gaming market.

Microsoft  could make Activision’s games exclusive to its cloud gaming platform,  Xbox Game Pass, cuting off distribution to other key players in the  space, the CMA said.

Cloud gaming is a technology that enables  gamers to access games via companies’ remote servers — effectively  streaming a game like you would a movie on Netflix. The technology is  still in its infancy, but Microsoft is betting big on it becoming a  mainstream way of playing games.

Microsoft announced its intention to acquire Activision Blizzard in January 2022 for $69 billion, in [one of the biggest deals the video game industry has seen](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/18/microsoft-to-buy-activision.html) to date.

Executives  at the Redmond, Washington-based technology giant believe the  acquisition will boost its efforts in gaming by adding lucrative  franchises like Call of Duty and Candy Crush Saga to its content  offerings.

However, some of Microsoft’s competitors contested the  deal, concerned it may give Microsoft a tight grip on the $200 billion  games market. Of particular concern was the prospect that Microsoft [may shut off distribution access to Activision’s popular Call of Duty franchise](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2022/09/16/microsoft-is-growing-tired-of-sonys-call-of-duty-complaints/?sh=bd568595ebb9) for certain platforms.

[Sony](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/6758.T-JP/), in particular, has voiced concern with Microsoft’s Activision purchase.  The Japanese gaming giant fears that Microsoft could make Call of Duty  exclusive to its Xbox consoles in the long run. 

 Microsoft sought to allay those concerns by offering Sony, [Nintendo](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/7974.T-JP/), [Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/)

and other firms [10-year agreements](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/07/microsoft-says-it-will-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo-for-10-years.html) to continue bringing Call of Duty to their respective gaming platforms.

Microsoft  argues it wouldn’t be financially beneficial to withhold Call of Duty  from PlayStation, Nintendo and other rivals given the licensing income  it generates from keeping the game available on their platforms.

Microsoft  President Brad Smith told CNBC last month that the company is offering  Sony the same agreement as it did Nintendo — to make Call of Duty  available on PlayStation at the same time as on Xbox, with the same  features. Sony still opposes the deal.

The CMA had raised concerns  with the potential for Microsoft to hinder competition in the nascent  cloud gaming market via its Xbox Game Pass subscription service, which  offers cloud gaming among its perks. Microsoft has committed to bring  new Call of Duty titles to Xbox Game Pass on day one of its release.

Cloud  gaming, or the ability to access games via PC or mobile devices over  the internet, is still in its infancy and requires a strong broadband  connection to work well. According to network intelligence firm  Sandvine, cloud gaming made up less than 1% of global internet traffic  in 2022.

Even with the CMA’s blessing, Microsoft will still need to convince other regulators not to block the deal. The EU [continues to probe the merger](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/21/microsoft-will-bring-xbox-games-to-nvidias-cloud-gaming-service.html) to assess whether it hurts competition, while the U.S. Federal Trade Commission [sued to block the deal](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/08/ftc-sues-to-block-microsofts-acquisition-of-game-giant-activision-blizzard.html) on antitrust grounds.

2023-04-25 22:33:00,Microsoft,MSFT,Help with strategy: Swing Trading (Large Capital/Small profits),"Hello, I have been trading stocks and options for 3 years now and have built up my account to a modest size after incurring heavy losses buying calls and puts and just generally bad stock picks.
I built my account up using a combined strategy of selling puts and swing trading MSFT, GOOG, and some other stable stocks. 
My question is regarding using large capital (say $10000) to make small, quick daily profits (tune of $100-150; +1-1.5%) only using safe stocks like MSFT with good amount of swings. I keep some cash (20% of allocated amount) to double down. Is this viable? Risk is that I get some draw downs if there is a big sell-off (but I’ll still hold/double down since I am confident that MSFT is undervalued based on Morningstar reports, their earnings, etc.). Is it a good strategy if I am thinking I just need to cover daily costs (like eating out, for instance)? Is there something I am not seeing? If so, please let me know. I would appreciate any advice.

2023-04-25 20:10:57,Microsoft,MSFT,Microsoft earnings are out – here are the numbers,"Microsoft reported earnings after the bell. Here are the results.

Earnings: $2.45 per share, vs. $2.23 per share as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

Revenue: $52.86 billion, vs. $51.02 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

Revenue is projected to be up 3% from a year earlier, which would mark a second straight quarter of growth below 10%. Before that, percentage expansion had been in double digits in every quarter since 2017.

Results are expected to be weakest in Microsoft’s personal computing division, which includes Windows operating system licenses sold to PC makers, along with Xbox consoles and Surface devices. Research firm Gartner estimated that PC shipments declined 30% in the quarter.

Microsoft’s Azure cloud business remains a bright spot for the company, but growth is slowing. Analysts surveyed by CNBC expect 26.5% growth from a year earlier, while analysts polled by StreetAccount predict 27.2% growth. Microsoft doesn’t disclose the size of its Azure business in dollars.

In the fiscal second quarter, revenue from Azure and other cloud services grew by 31%, down from 35% in the prior period.

Investors have another reason to be excited about Azure, which has aligned itself with ChatGPT creator OpenAI.

During the quarter, Microsoft announced a new multibillion-dollar investment in OpenAI and said it would draw on the company’s artificial intelligence models for a new version of its Bing search engine and enhancements to the Microsoft 365 productivity software.


Microsoft shares have risen 17% so far this year, while the S&P 500 index is up less than 8% over the same period.

Executives will discuss the results with analysts and issue guidance on a conference call starting at 5:30 p.m. ET.

2023-04-25 01:09:15,Microsoft,MSFT,How to best allocate final 15% of my porfolio?,"Hi there! 

&#x200B;

I will try to keep this brief, but would really love to have some conversations with others about my allocation because I keep thinking myself in circles.

&#x200B;

Currently my portfolio is:   


* Spy/Voo: 47% 
* VXUS: 15% 
* Target Date - 2055: 7%
* SCHD:  5%
* QQQ:  1%
* Individual Stocks:  23% (3% Appl, 3% MSFT, 3% CRM, 3% ABBV, 2% Cost, 2% UNH, 2% JPM, 2% BRK.B, 2% WMT)

&#x200B;

I have been targeting a portfolio that will have roughly: 

* SPY: 40%
* Target Date: 30% 
* VXUS: 10%
* ???: 15% 
* Individual Stocks: 5%

&#x200B;

(Context, the VXUS will go down as my 401k invests into target date fund which is already 1/3 VXUS but I will use my personal brokerage to help rebalance as needed)

&#x200B;

I have held most of the individual stocks for quite a few years, its how I got started investing. They have all done well, luckily to some degree and some due to not touching for a few years. 

I have gone back and forth researching, and thinking myself in circles. I have considered just selling my positions in Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, etc and buying QQQ to keep a large cap growth tilt but worry it is just chasing performance. 

I have considered heavily SCHD and AVUV; SCHD for the drip effect in my roth to let it accumulate tax free but just havent found a reason to have conviction given my timeline is 20-30 years. AVUV in theory sounds good, the short track record and the ability to stomach downturns of SCV at 10-15% of my portfolio is possible but there isnt a ton of data to back up the fund. 

&#x200B;

I would love others thoughts and opinions on this, I have been in a mental pretzel for weeks thinking about this.",7,66,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12y39k6/how_to_best_allocate_final_15_of_my_porfolio/

1) Aapl
2) Mcd
3) Pepsi
4) ABT &ABBV
5) JNJ
6) MSFT
7) WMT
8) GOOG/Googl

1-3 I would love to have all 3 be a large contributor in an ETF. 

4-8: I would love to have all of these be weighted as close as possible to each other.

Edit: For anyone wondering the same thing , I decided to buy individual stocks instead of and ETF. Paying a high MER for an ETf that I liked the portfolio and weighting of is annoying and unnecessary. I like selling “safe covered calls” so this works out well.

ETFchannel was a godsend for getting to this decision since they have a tool that searches for the desired stocks with their total weighting.",12,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12x1oqg/searching_for_etf_tool_with_xyz_stocks_in_them/

*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended little changed Friday and finished lower for the week as investors evaluated the latest earnings results and concerns of disappointing profits.
*****
> The 30-stock index added 22.34 points, or 0.07%, to end at 33,808.96, while the S&P 500 eked out a 0.09% gain to settle at 4,133.52. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.11% to close at 12,072.46.
*****
> All major indices finished the week in the red, with the Dow falling 0.23% to snap a four-week win streak. The tech-heavy Nasdaq saw the biggest decline, falling 0.42%, while the S&P slipped 0.1%.
*****
> “There’s the continued push-pull of the fact that the economy has been a lot more resilient than many people expected and corporate earnings have held up pretty well, all things considered,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance.
*****
> Even so, he noted that the Federal Reserve has raised rates substantially over the last year. Zaccarelli said that even if the central bank hikes as anticipated in May, it will likely hold rates at a higher level than the market expects.
*****
> “You can kind of see the the bull and bear case really right there in a nutshell as far as resilient economy with stronger-than-expected corporate earnings versus a very hot, very restrictive monetary policy coming from the Fed,” he said.
*****
> Earnings season continued Friday, with results from Procter & Gamble. The consumer products company gained 3.5% after beating expectations and lifting it sales forecast. As of Friday morning, 76% of S&P 500 companies reporting earnings so far have beaten analyst EPS estimates, according to FactSet.
*****
> Elsewhere, materials stocks were the worst performers, with Freeport-McMoRan falling 4.1%. Albemarle tumbled 10% as Chile said it would nationalize its lithium industry.
*****
> While companies broadly beat expectations this week, overall profit reports failed to boost stocks, with some investors fearing an earnings drop looms with a likely recession ahead.
*****
> “So far, earnings season is off to an uneventful start, with many companies meeting already reduced earnings expectations and that helps to explain the lack of movement in the major stock indices over the past few days,” said Carol Schleif, chief investment officer at BMO Family Office, adding that she expects stocks to trade in a tight range for some time.
*****
> Earnings continue next week with results on deck from Big Tech companies Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms and Microsoft.

> # Lithium: The Cycle Continues

> If you haven't checked the price of lithium lately, you might be in for a surprise. Spot prices for lithium carbonate in China have collapsed by two-thirds since hitting record highs in November of last year. Prices have gone from $84k per ton to $25k per ton. That unwinds the vast majority of a spectacular surge that played out from 2020 to 2022. Lithium initially surged 1,279% from July 2020 to March 2022 as part of the broader explosion of commodity prices and booming demand for electric vehicles, eventually peaking up 1,387% from the post-COVID lows. It's easy to forget that this critical battery input had already gone through one such cycle. A 224% rally in 6 months during late 2015 and early 2016 before a long, slow bear market that saw prices down 78% over several years.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/042123-Lithium-1.png))**

> In the equity market, the price cycle hasn't been as dramatic in percentage terms, but there has still nonetheless been a double cycle of surging stock prices in 2016 followed by a grinding bear market, and then an even more dramatic surge through late 2022 that is now sliding into reverse. On Thursday, Chile's government announced reforms to its lithium extraction policy. While existing contracts with firms that operate in the rich lithium brine deposits of the Chilean Atacama desert will be honored, the market is looking at weaker lithium prices and the fact that existing contracts will be replaced by less favorable ones 10+ years down the line and hitting lithium players. SQM is off 21% today while ALB is 10% lower.

> In the above table the “Worst Months” performance of DJIA, S&P 500, and NASDAQ have been separated by year of the four-year-presidential-election cycle going back to 1951 for DJIA and S&P 500 and 1971 for NASDAQ. NASDAQ’s “Worst Months” are July through October compared to May to October for DJIA and S&P 500. Even though pre-election years have historically been the best performing year of the four-year cycle, performance during the “Worst Months” has not been the least bit impressive. In 18 pre-election year “Worst Months” periods, DJIA has averaged a meager 1.14%. S&P 500 is only slightly better +1.81% while NASDAQ’s average is under 1%. Frequency of gains or percentage of time higher in pre-election years “Worst Months” is only slightly better than 50-50.

> Because of the elevated level of risk that has been historically observed during the “Worst Six Months” of the year and its historically tepid returns, reducing long exposure and developing a defensive strategy is the approach taken in the Almanac Investor Stock and ETF Portfolios. We do not merely “sell in May and go away.” Instead, we take some profits, trim or outright sell underperforming stock and ETF positions, tighten stop losses and limit adding new long exposure to positions from sectors that have a demonstrated a record of outperforming during the “Worst Months” period.

> For those with a lower risk tolerance or a desire to take a break from trading, the “Worst Months” are a great opportunity to unwind some longs and move into the relative safety of cash, Treasury bonds, gold and/or some combination of traditional defensive assets. For the first time in over a decade, cash can currently earn something other than zero. Preservation of capital may be more important than growth and with historical averages and frequency of gains reduced; the “Worst Six Months” are a good time to simply step aside if you prefer. August, September and/or October have provided some excellent buying opportunities over the years and could do the same again this year.

> # Sector Breadth All Over the Place

> In terms of price, the Industrials sector remains 5.75% below its high from January of last year and has yet to even take out the highs from earlier this year, but breadth has been more constructive recently. Just yesterday, the cumulative advance/decline line hit a new all time high.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/041823-Sectors-1.png))**

> Although that measure of breadth is making promising moves, other breadth measures have not exactly echoed that strength. In spite of the record high in the cumulative A/D line Monday, only 37% of the sector's stocks finished above their 50-DMAs. As shown below, of all other instances of a record high in the cumulative AD line, there has never been such a low reading in the percentage of stocks above their 50-DMAs. In fact, no other readings have even crossed into the 30% range! For the vast majority of previous highs, the percentage of stocks above their 50-DMAs has sat at 70% or more.


> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/041823-Sectors-2a.png))**

> All that is to say that most Industrials sector stocks are moving higher, but have not yet moved above potential resistance at their 50-DMAs. And even though the reading on the percentage of stocks above their 50-DMAs is low at the moment, that is not to say it is not improving rapidly. As shown below, it has risen sharply from the low of 19.18% on April 6th. Furthermore, whereas Monday's close only saw 37% of the sector finish above their 50-DMAs, as of mid-morning Tuesday the reading is already up another 8.2 percentage points to 45.2% as the average stock in the sector trades just 7 bps below its 50-DMA.

> # Volatility Is The Toll We Pay

> “It’s a proprietary strategy. I can’t go into it in great detail.” – Bernie Madoff

> Although Bernie Madoff was quite vague when asked how he had a strategy that printed money month after month when no one else could match it, as investors we know one thing and that is markets don’t always go straight up.

> Burt White, our Managing Director and Chief Strategy Officer, likes to say that volatility is the toll we pay to invest. No one wants to pay a toll, but sometimes you just have to do it to get where you are going. When I lived in Charlotte and would drive back up to Ohio for holidays, I’d have to pay the great state of West Virginia $4.25 three different times on I-77. I didn’t like it, but Santa brought the kids presents up there and I had to do it.

> Getting back to the stock market, volatility is that toll that we pay for enjoying longer-term returns. Below is a great chart that sums it up and thanks to our friends at Ned Davis Research for helping us with the data.

> Here’s what you need to know regarding the S&P 500:

> Each year sees more than seven different 3% percent dips.
More than three times a year do stocks correct 5%.
About once a year on average sees a 10% correction.
A 15% major correction happens every year-and-a-half.
A 20% bear markets happens about every three years.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/blog-1-1-800x301.png))**

> Another quote I like is from Regis Philbin when he said, “I’m involved in the stock market, which is fun, but sometimes very painful.” Well, this year has been fun for investors, but last year was quite painful.

> After more than a 120% rally off the March 2020 lows, maybe the bear market we saw last year shouldn’t have caught as many investors off guard like it did? We didn’t quite see a 25% bear market happening last year, but we expected as much as a 15% correction at some point. With the historically aggressive Fed, inflation soaring, China lockdowns, the war, and supply chains in disarray, it was a perfect cocktail for a bear market.

> The truth though is we get spoiled by the good times and when the rough times hit, we are almost surprised that bad times ever happen. Well, they do happen and it is all part of investing, or the toll we pay to invest. Just know this, volatility and bear markets have happened before and will happen again. The good new though is after this bad times, likely better times will be coming!

# **Dow sheds more than 100 points Friday, but notches fourth straight positive week: Live updates - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/13/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)**
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell Friday, but was headed for a positive week, as investors assessed a weak retail sales report that dented enthusiasm around a stronger-than-expected start to corporate earnings.
*****
> The 30-stock Dow dropped 143.22 points, or about 0.42%, to 33,886.47. The S&P 500 fell 0.21% to 4,137.64. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite slid 0.35% to 12,123.47.
*****
> The Dow, however, notched its fourth-straight positive week, rising 1.2%. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, meanwhile, nabbed their fourth positive week in five. The broad-market index added 0.79% for the week, while the Nasdaq ticked higher by 0.29%.
*****
> Advance retail sales in March showed consumer spending fell twice as much as expected. Retail sales declined by 1% last month, more than the 0.5% drop expected by economists polled by Dow Jones, in part because consumers paid less for fuel.
*****
> “Retail sales came in weaker than expected, but a lot of the miss had to do with lower gas prices, which all things being equal is a slight positive for spending,” wrote Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance.
*****
> “Inflation has been coming down as gas prices have been coming down, but that can reverse in an instant, which would drive the headline numbers higher. What is more concerning is that core (which excludes food and gas prices) has been stubbornly high – and where we believe the risks to higher-rates-for-longer lie,” Zaccarelli added.
*****
> The disappointing retail sales data offset excitement around strong corporate earnings. JPMorgan Chase reported record revenue that beat analysts’ expectations, with the stock rising more than 7%. Wells Fargo shares briefly rose as much as 2.1% after the bank reported growing profits, before closing about flat. These were the first bank earnings since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank last month.
*****
> Elsewhere, UnitedHealth, which has the biggest weighting in the Dow, fell 2.7% after what Mizuho described as a “modest beat and raise.” The action came after UnitedHealth said it’s spending more for new diabetes and weight loss drugs from Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly.
*****
> Meanwhile, Boeing closed lower by more than 5%. On Thursday, the aircraft maker warned of delivery delays for some of its 737 Max planes.
*****
> Expectations for this earnings season are downbeat. Analysts polled by Refinitiv expect S&P 500 earnings fell more than 5% in the first quarter. That forecast comes as companies deal with persistent inflation and higher rates.
*****
> “The bar has never been set lower,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Financial. “My guess is with consensus expectations for the S&P 500 to show earnings that are down some 5%, that may well be overstating what we actually find out.”
*****
> “I think that what’s going to be super important is the kind of guidance we get, and how confident that corporations will be in guiding for the next three quarters in the face of what likely will be a slower economy.”
*****
> Investors also assessed two back-to-back reports this week signaling cooling inflation. The March producer price index, a measure of prices paid by companies, declined 0.5% from the prior month, even as economists polled by Dow Jones expected prices to stay the same. Excluding food and energy, the index shed 0.1% from the prior month, while economists estimated a 0.2% month-to-month increase.
*****
> The PPI, which is considered a leading indicator of consumer inflation, bolstered a trend of easing inflation seen in the March consumer price index report released Wednesday. Consumer prices grew 5% on an annual basis, which was the smallest year-over-year increase in nearly two years.

> # Three More Bullish Signals The Bears Don’t Want To See

> “If you don’t know where you want to get to….it doesn’t matter which way you go.” -The Cheshire Cat to Alice in Alice in Wonderland.

> Stocks have continued to stage an impressive rally off the mid-March lows, so much so that we have now seen multiple rare and potentially bullish signals trigger. Today, I’ll take a look at three of these signals. Yes, by itself any one of these signals could be noise, but when you start stacking them on top of each other, like the Cheshire Cat said in the quote above, stocks likely want to go higher and we should be ready to know where they could head.

> First up, the S&P 500 had it’s best first quarter since 2019, up 7.0%, which came on the heels of 7.1% gain the quarter before. What happened after previous big first quarters? I found there were 16 other first quarters that gained at least 5% and the final three quarters of the year finished higher 15 times. Yes, the one year that didn’t work was 1987 and when people hear that year, they start to get worried. Well, stocks were up 40% for the year in August back then, so we’ll worry about having another 1987 if we see returns like that (which we don’t expect). Until then, this is another clue the bulls could have a nice 2023.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/blog-1-800x564.png))**

> Next, we’ve heard a lot how only a few stocks are leading the overall markets higher. We don’t fully agree there and one way to show this is there was a recent sign of extreme buying pressure across many sectors and stocks. Using data from our friends at Ned Davis Research, more than 93% of the stocks in the NDR universe were recently above their 10-day moving average. All you need to know here is this is a rare sign of broad-based strength and a year later stocks were higher 23 out of 24 times with some very solid returns along the way.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/blog-2-800x338.png))**

> Lastly, Marty Zweig is known as one of the best traders ever and he coined the Zweig Breadth Thrust (ZBT) indicator many years ago. Well, we just saw a rare trigger of this potentially bullish signal. To keep it simple, this signal looks at all the stocks on the NYSE and it looks for periods of extreme oversold periods moving to periods of extremely overbought in a short timeframe. Think of it as a washout and then heavy buying coming in, which tends to open the door to higher prices.

> The table below shows the previous 14 ZBTs and what happened next. Wouldn’t you know it, but the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time. That is 14 out of 14 and up 23.3% on average. Sure, the sample size isn’t probably as large as we’d like to consider this statistically relevant, but I’d sure rather know this than ignore it.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/blog-3-800x755.png))**

> Finally, here’s a chart showing the ZBTs. Sometimes a picture tells the story and one look at this, and it would be quite rare for this signal to trigger and for stocks to simply drop right back to new lows. In fact, usually it happens ahead of periods of strength.

> # First Republic and Other Banks See Large Jumps in Short Interest

> Short interest figures get published every two weeks, and movements in short interest are a helpful way to gauge bull/bear positioning on individual names as well as groups and sectors. When a stock has a high percentage of shares sold short, it means that a lot of investors are betting against it. If a highly-shorted company manages to produce better than expected results, however, shares will often see outsized gains as many of those shorts rush to cover.

> With bank failures and deposit flight emerging in March, causing two S&P 500 bank stocks to fail and many other regional bank stocks to fall precipitously, we were interested to see how short interest levels changed during the month. End-of-month short interest figures for March were just recently published, and below is a table showing stocks in the S&P 1500 that saw the biggest increases in short interest as a percentage of float (SIPF) during the month.

> As shown, the two stocks that saw the biggest increases in short interest were First Republic Bank (FRC) and PacWest Bancorp (PACW). At the end of February, FRC only had 2.71% of its float sold short, but by the end of March, that figure had spiked to 29.51%. PacWest's jump in short interest was slightly less extreme, but it was extreme nonetheless, rising from 3.59% up to 20.56% in March. Another nine Financials are on the list of the 30 S&P 1500 stocks that saw the biggest jumps in SIPF in March, while another five REITs made the list as well.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/changesipf.png))**

> Below is a better look at just how much short interest spiked for First Republic (FRC) in March. While the bank did see a mini-spike in late 2018 when the broader market was struggling with another batch of Fed tightening, FRC's short interest normally sits between 0-5% of float. Now it's up to nearly 30%. For a stock that's down 94% from its highs, where do you think the risk/reward lies at this point?

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/frcfloat.png))**

> In terms of the most heavily shorted stocks, only Big Lots (BIG) currently has a higher percentage of its float sold short than FRC in the S&P 1500.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/sp1500short.png))**

> Below is a chart showing the average change in SIPF for stocks in the S&P 1500 by industry group in the month of March. As shown, the Banks saw the biggest average jump at 0.78 ppts, followed by Telecom Services, Media & Entertainment, and REITs. Stocks in the Consumer Durables & Apparel group saw the largest decline in SIPF at -0.23 ppts.

> # Sentiment: Back to the 20s

> Whereas last week saw a huge rebound in bullish sentiment after the S&P 500's breakout above March highs, the more listless price action of the past week resulted in a modest turnaround in sentiment. The latest AAII sentiment survey showed only 26.1% of respondents reported as bullish compared to the recent high of 33.3% last week. The 7.2 percentage point decline was the largest one-week drop in bulls since the last week of February when it declined by 12.5 percentage points. That leaves bullish sentiment right in the middle of the range since the start of 2022.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/041323-AAII-1.png))**

> Although bullish sentiment fell, without any considerable push lower for the S&P 500, bearish sentiment went little changed falling just half of one percentage point down to 34.5%. Like last week, that remains the lowest reading since the week of February 16th.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/041323-AAII-2.png))**

> That means that all of the declines in bullish and bearish sentiment flowed to the neutral camp with a surge of 7.9 percentage points; the largest one-week increase since the first week of the year. At 39.5%, neutral sentiment is at the high end of the past few years' range and only 0.3 percentage points below the late February high.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/041323-AAII-4.png))**

> The AAII survey was not the only sentiment reading to take a more bearish tone this week. The NAAIM Exposure index's latest release today showed investment managers reduced equity exposure. Meanwhile, the Investors Intelligence survey's bull-bear spread has actually continued to rise resulting in the highest reading since the first week of 2022. Additionally, as we noted in Monday's Chart of the Day, the TD Ameritrade Investor Movement Index went unchanged in March after rebounding in the proceeding few months. In other words, across multiple readings, sentiment has improved but has yet to definitively shift to bullish.

> # The Good, The Bad, The Inflation

> The March inflation report showed that CPI inflation rose only 0.1%, slightly below expectations. Over the past year, inflation is now up 5%, well off the peak 9% from June 2022. As you can see below, the big driver of lower inflation has been energy and food.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Blog-2023-04-13-headline-CPI-662x800.png))**

> Energy makes up about 7% of the “inflation basket”, split almost equally into commodities (like gasoline) and services (like electricity and piped gas). Thanks to the pullback in oil prices, energy commodity prices are now below where they were in December 2021. The recent drop in natural gas prices has also sent services prices lower over the past couple of months.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Blog-2023-04-13-energy-prices-800x660.png))**

> Further good news: prices for “food at home”, i.e. groceries, fell 0.3% in March. This is the first price decline since September 2020, and bodes well even for prices and restaurants and such (which are still elevated).

> # Lower energy and food prices are a big deal, for consumption
> Lower inflation, by way of lower energy and food prices, means “real” incomes, i.e. incomes adjusted for inflation, remain strong. More so if the labor market remains healthy, which looks to be the case as we wrote the other day.

> The chart below shows annualized growth rates of disposable income, employee compensation (across all workers in the economy), and inflation. Over the past 3, 6 and 12 months, disposable income has run ahead of inflation. Part of this is because social security incomes got a big inflation-adjusted boost in January. But even employee compensation is running ahead of inflation. That’s really positive for consumer spending, which makes up 70% of the economy.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Blog-2023-04-13-DPI-vs-comp-vs-inflation-602x800.png))**

> # The big story: Housing inflation may finally be turning (lower)
> Core inflation, excluding food and energy, rose 0.4% in March. Over the past 3 months, core inflation is up 5.1% (annualized pace) and its up 5.6% over the past year. So, not much of a slowdown.

> Part of the reason is that housing inflation has been running high.

> But we got very good news on that front. Rents of primary residences and owners’ equivalent rent (rental equivalent of owner-occupied homes) rose “only” 0.5%. While still high, that pace is the slowest monthly increase in a year. Over the past 9 months, housing inflation averaged about +0.7% per month, which translates to a whopping 9% annualized rate!

> So, the slowdown in March is significant, and most welcome.

> Of course, as we’ve written about in the past, we’ve already seen a sharp deceleration in market rents. It’s just that the official inflation data has been really slow to catch up to that reality. But that may be changing now and bodes well for core inflation to slow down across the rest of this year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Blog-2023-04-13-rents-market-vs-official-599x800.png))**

> # The bad news: Core inflation ex housing remains elevated
> That was the good news, i.e. a slowdown in energy, food and housing inflation. However, the rest of it still looks to be elevated.

> For one thing, vehicle prices are no longer falling as fast as they were. Vehicle prices, especially for used cars, was another big factor in pulling inflation lower over the last few months. Used car prices fell 0.9% in March, but that’s the smallest decline in 7 months. Private data suggests that used car prices are rising again. New vehicle prices also rose 0.4%, breaking a recent downward trend.

> Outside of vehicles, a lot of goods and services that were initially hit by the pandemic are still seeing significant price increases. These include goods like household furnishings and apparel, and services like hotels and airlines fares.

> Even beyond that, services such as day care, personal care, and recreation, are seeing inflation running well above what we saw before the pandemic.

> All of which is a sign that demand for these goods and services remains strong.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Blog-2023-04-13-supercore-select-items-inflation-601x800.png))**

> # What does this mean for the Fed?
> Fed officials have explicitly said that they want to see core services ex housing decelerate. In short, they’re looking at inflation excluding energy, food and housing, the three categories where we’ve had positive news. Unfortunately, there’s not much evidence that this slice of the inflation basket is decelerating, yet. The good news is that it tends to be correlated to wage growth, and there’s strong evidence that wage growth is moving closer to what we saw pre-pandemic.

> Now, the Fed is unlikely to continue raising interest rates much further from here, especially since we had a banking crisis, and they may want to play cautious. Plus, as we wrote a few weeks ago, banks tightening credit in response to the crisis is akin to rate increases.

> At the same time, they are likely to keep rates where they are until they see convincing evidence of inflation falling, especially core services ex housing inflation.

> This is not what investors expect. Instead, investors expect the Fed to start cutting rates in late summer, pricing in at least 3 rate cuts by the end of 2023. Indicating that bond investors believe a crisis or recession is likely in the near-term. That’s clearly not where Fed officials are right now. We’re not there either, for now.

> Eventually, market pricing and Fed officials’ views must converge. In the meantime, expect volatility, especially in the bond market.

> # 10-Year 10-Baggers

> Peter Lynch's 1989 book One Up On Wall Street introduced investors to the word ""ten bagger,"" which represents an investment that appreciates by 10x (1,000%) its initial purchase price.

> Today we wanted to highlight the stocks that have been ""ten baggers"" over the last ten years. In the Russell 1,000, 33 names are up more than 1,000% since April 12th, 2013. Over the same 10-year period, the S&P 500 tracking ETF (SPY) is up 211%. As shown below, NVIDIA (NVDA) is up the most with a gain of 8,833%, followed by Tesla (TSLA) at 6,304% and then Plug Power (PLUG) at 5,477%.

> There are 16 Technology stocks on the list of 33 ten baggers, which is the most of any sector. Other Tech stocks on the list include AMD, Enphase Energy (ENPH), Broadcom (AVGO), Fortinet (FTNT), Lam Research (LRCX), and even the two largest stocks in the US - Apple (AAPL), and Microsoft (MSFT). Netflix (NFLX) is also another notable on the list with a gain of 1,266%.

> Some other notables include Industrials stocks like Axon -- the maker of Tasers and police body cameras, Industrials stocks like Builders FirstSource (BLDR) and Old Dominion Freight (ODFL), and Vince VcMahon's World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), which is set to be bought by Endeavor Group (EDR).

> Stocks that are already up 1,000%+ over the last ten years seem unlikely to repeat that over the next ten years. The obvious next question is: which stocks will be ten baggers over the next ten years? As Peter Lynch instructed, you'll have to do your research!

>  Small business optimism continued to decline in March with the headline index from the NFIB falling from 90.9 down to 90.1. That headline reading was actually better than the consensus forecast of 89.3, but it was still in the bottom decile of the indicator's historical range dating back to 1986.

> Looking across individual categories, breadth was weak in the report with only three indices moving higher month over month, three going unchanged, and all the others falling. As with the headline number, many categories are also historically depressed in the bottom decile of readings including a record low.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/041123-NFIB-2.png))**

> That record low was in the percentage of respondents reporting now as a good time to expand. Only 2% reported now as a good time to expand, down 4 points month over month. Albeit the reading has been at the low end of its historical range for much of the past year, March's reading matched the historical low form March 2009.

> Given the small business outlook for the economy has soured, fewer firms are reporting plans to increase hiring or capital expenditures. In fact, the index for capex plans fell to 20, which alongside March 2021, is the lowest reading since the spring of 2020. Similarly, hiring plans are at new lows for the post-pandemic period.

> One factor likely impacting business plans has been financial conditions. The most pronounced decline of any category last month was a record 4-point decline in the availability of loans. While the reading has been rolling over for some time, that drop leaves the index at the lowest level since December 2012.

> # Inflation Concerns Continue to Ease

> In an earlier post, we mentioned the record-low reading in the percentage of small businesses perceiving now as a good time to expand. As for what these firms perceive to be their most pressing issues, inflation continues to be the single most prevalent answer at 24%, albeit the gap has narrowed dramatically. Quality of labor is now only a single percentage point behind at 23%, and when combined with cost of labor, the two issues account for over a third of small businesses' biggest problems. From a historical standpoint, those three readings all remain elevated and account for a massive share of the most pressing issues facing small businesses.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/041123-NFIB-MIP-1.png))**

> The four percentage point drop month over month in the percentage of respondents reporting inflation as their biggest issue is the largest decline since January when it had fallen 6 percentage points. As a result, the category is only down to the lowest level since January 2022 which remains well outside the range of pre-pandemic readings. In other words, inflation appears to be improving compared to last July when it was top of mind for 37% of small businesses, but it is still nowhere near a non-issue.

> Picking up some of those losses has been government-related concerns. This series has historically held a political bias in which under Republican administrations small businesses are less concerned with red tape and taxes and vice versa during Democratic administrations. With the surge in inflation concerns during President Biden's tenure, this index has remained historically low but has begun to rise more recently as inflation has improved.

> Another area to see a rise in firms reporting it as their biggest problem has been poor sales. While the reading is far from flying, it has begun trending higher accounting for 5% of responses in March. That pairs with the index for actual reported sales changes which have remained firmly negative for nearly a year now.

> # 2023 Still Tracking Pre-Election Year Pattern But Gains May Be Muted

> Despite the recent selloff and volatility S&P 500 still tracks typical pre-election year market trends. However, uncertainties about rates, inflation, recession, banking and economic growth are likely to mute the usual pre-election year gains. A debt ceiling standoff could keep stocks under pressure during the Worst Six Months May-October.

2023-04-13 14:13:27,Microsoft,MSFT,Does it make sense for me to sell risky stocks for loss now and reinvest into something with less risk?,"I entered the workforce in 2020 and likewise, got into investing at a time where everything was green. As a result, I’m now in a place where current and future investments will be going into much safer stocks and ETFs (VOO, VTI, MSFT, etc). However I am still holding a fair portion of risky and volatile stocks I’ve since learned I hate holding (PLUG, PLTR, SQ, ARK ETFs, etc).

In my head, it makes sense for me to sell these stocks, even for a loss, and move that cash back into stocks I feel more comfortable holding, can provide steady gains, and that I know I’ll come out on the other side of alive eventually. Is this the right move to make?",8,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12kqmuu/does_it_make_sense_for_me_to_sell_risky_stocks/
2023-04-05 23:48:43,Microsoft,MSFT,What are some interesting tech stocks with actual EPS and is not a big tech?,"Actual EPS: Has positive EPS on a GAAP basis.  So this would not include companies that are not profitable on a GAAP basis, like Cloudflare, SentinelOne, Okta, etc.  And yes, I understand that non-GAAP is related to share-based compensation, but I just want to stay on the safe side.

Not a big tech.  I consider the following big tech: MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, GOOG, NVDA, META, TSLA, NFLX.

Also, why do you consider the stocks you name to be interesting?  I will do my own DD but curious about your thoughts.",27,57,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12d2ah4/what_are_some_interesting_tech_stocks_with_actual/
2023-04-03 21:37:36,Microsoft,MSFT,"Digital Age for Big Oil using Big Tech $HAL & $MSFT ; $AMZN & $BP, $SHEL","[https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/How-New-Technology-Will-Disrupt-The-Oil-And-Gas-Industry.html](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/How-New-Technology-Will-Disrupt-The-Oil-And-Gas-Industry.html)

 

At a certain point in its lifecycle, every industry faces its moment of reckoning with growing pressure to transform due to factors such as increasing competition, changing consumer preferences, government policy and other secular headwinds. The transformation usually takes the shape of improved supply chain discipline as well as streamlining business operations in order to achieve better operating margins.

For the oil and [natural gas](https://oilprice.com/admin/articles/Energy/Natural-Gas/Natural-Gas-A-Comprehensive-Guide-To-The-Worlds-Most-Crucial-Fuel.html) industry, the moment of truth arrived a few years ago after years of weak benchmark prices, shrinking margins and massive capital flight forced the sector to seriously rethink the way it does business with energy companies increasingly turning toward tech heavyweights for help in cutting costs and streamlining operations. 

A good case in point is [a partnership](https://www.hartenergy.com/news/halliburton-teams-advance-digital-capabilities-microsoft-accenture-188653) struck between **Haliburton Co.** (NYSE:HAL), **Microsoft Inc.** (NASDAQ:MSFT) and **Accenture Plc.** (NYSE:ACN) in 2020. For years, Haliburton, one of the world’s largest oilfield services companies, has been plagued by shrinking margins and chronic underperformance. The company eventually made a deal with the two cloud giants to migrate its existing data centers to cloud and enhance digital offerings.

 Halliburton is hardly alone.

After years of dilly-dallying, oil and gas companies are now rapidly moving their IT infrastructure out to the Cloud as well as adopting Business Process Management (BPM) systems. This frequently results in a leaner, more agile organizational model whilst delivering significant cost savings.

Barclays estimates that the upstream market digital services industry will grow from less than $5 billion in 2020 to a more than $30 billion annual tab by 2025, thus enabling $150 billion in annual savings for oil producers. Opportunities for cost savings include cutting capital expenditures (capex) as well as selling, general and administrative (SG&A) costs and transportation operating costs.

According to Barclays, the digital age is finally dawning for the energy sector with the market poised to erupt over the next five years. Over the past few years, Microsoft has struck cloud partnerships with several Big Oil companies including **ExxonMobil** (NYSE:XOM), **Chevron Inc**. (NYSE:CVX) and Haliburton while Google’s parent company **Alphabet Inc.** (NASDAQ:GOOG)[ has significantly expanded](https://www.slb.com/newsroom/press-release/2019/pr-2019-0513-slb-google-cloud) its partnership with **Schlumberger Ltd.** (NYSE:SLB), another oilfield services giant. Meanwhile, **Amazon Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) offers digital services to the industry through Amazon Web Services[ oil and gas division](https://aws.amazon.com/), and counts **BP Plc**. (NYSE:BP) and **Shell Plc** (NYSE:SHEL) among its top clients.

 

In many cases, Big Oil’s digital makeover is quite extensive.

For instance, Halliburton kicked off multiple digital transformation projects during the pandemic. Thailand’s PTT Exploration and Production and Kuwait Oil Company were among the notable oil and gas companies that were awarded Halliburton contracts to implement digital transformation and enhance efficiency and production at their oilfields. 

For years, Big Oil has been using tech companies’ enterprise software in their highly complex operating systems--including  rig management operations and precise drilling techniques. However, they have traditionally been somewhat reluctant to hand over their treasure troves of valuable data mainly on cyber security concerns as well as the need to maintain competitive advantages, preferring instead to develop most of their software developed in-house or by companies within the oilfield services sector such as Haliburton. 

However, this is now changing as they look for ways to improve operational efficiencies in a bid to squeeze higher cash flows and profits from their existing operations. 

Is the new approach working? The evidence seems to suggest so, with shale drilling costs on an encouraging downtrend. **J.P. Morgan** estimates that Permian's Delaware Basin oil drillers now require oil prices of just \~$33/bbl to break even down from $40/bbl in 2019. ",9,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12ays6h/digital_age_for_big_oil_using_big_tech_hal_msft/
2023-04-02 22:00:53,Microsoft,MSFT,"For long term growth tech company, is it good time to buy Nvidia now?","I believe AI is much more real thing than bitcoin, meta-verse. I think this will support Nvidia in the long run for growth. MSFT, GOOG also benefits from AI but given their wide products and diversified business, just feel this will limit their growth.

Tesla is also a good option for growth, but its CEO just too unpredictable, and Tesla has lots of competitors while Nvidia has strong moat for both software CUDA and hardware.
