2025-04-29 00:02:24,Tesla,TSLA,Is PLTR or TSLA a Better Position for AI Growth???,"I want to increase AI exposure in my portoflio because I am really bullish on AI for the future. Im debating between PLTR and TSLA. I feel like TSLA has so much potential in the AI space with their fully autonomous taxi service that allows Tesla owners to make money with their cars, however, waymo is a strong competitor here. The other TSLA project im pretty bullish about is their AI robots. The ceo of Nvidia recently said that they believe autonomous robots are the next stage of the AI boom. I think there is a lot of potential here if companies can adopt them to save money with more manual work.

My biggest worry with Tesla is the controversy surrounding it. Tesla's name has been completely destroyed internationally. BYD was already beating them by a lot but now its going to be bad. I also am a bit worried that the CEO will continue to do more to destroy the Tesla name through other shocking actions.

Any thoughts or advice on which one is should add?",0,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kaaiao/is_pltr_or_tsla_a_better_position_for_ai_growth/
2025-04-25 23:20:31,Tesla,TSLA,So how does the lowered regulation for autonomous vehicles actually help Tesla achieve a profitable autonomous taxi service?,"Ok. So what I learned finally after scouring every article out there is this.  Under new AV rules:

1-reporting standard for AV involved crashes will be lowered NOT eliminated; I guess that saves Tesla a few buck every month.
2-AV vehicles can be built with less hardware (mirrors, brakes) since they don’t need a driver.  I guess we can lower the cost of the car a bit. 

So how does this warrant a 10% price move today on TSLA after prior days move after a horrible earnings report?  Did everyone see “less regulation” titles and assume that all of a sudden Tesla cars would be driving themselves, because it was the previous regulations that was stopping Tesla from having an actual autonomous car deployed?

2025-04-25 22:32:09,Tesla,TSLA,SPY and TSLA Flows Look Strong - But Something Feels Off Under the Hood,"Not trying to be a doomer, but after watching the action into close today, it’s hard to shake the feeling that something doesn’t add up:

SPY dark pool inflow was heavy, yeah, but the majority of the late prints were at bid, not ask. That’s smart money selling into strength, not loading for continuation.

TSLA was heavily distributed at the top, despite the media pump. Price action stayed glued to gamma walls, no real organic movement past resistance.

VIX dropped but didn’t collapse, which is weird. If this rally was legit, VIX should've flushed much harder. Holding above 23 tells me big players are still hedged.

After-hours was ""calm"", but a little too calm. No meaningful momentum, no real follow through.


It’s hard to call tops, I’m not claiming to. But between the sell-side dark pool flow, the late-day bid prints, and VIX refusing to die, I’m definitely raising an eyebrow.

Just my two cents.

News: [Trump Says He'll Be Very Nice To China In Trade Talks](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-23/trump-says-he-ll-be-very-nice-to-china-in-trade-talks)

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\- Reported Q1 earnings with EPS of $0.27 vs. $0.39 expected and revenue of $19.34B vs. $21.11B expected. Total revenue declined 9% year-over-year, with automotive revenue dropping 20% to $14B. Net income fell 71% to $409M, or $0.12 per share. The company attributed the decline to factory retooling for the refreshed Model Y, lower average selling prices, and increased sales incentives. That was a brutal earnings report, yet Trump announcing that he'll be nice to China saved the stock and pushed the entire market up. Interested in $275 and $250 levels.

Whether this will actually hold and be his stance going forward is entirely up to him (he changed his mind a lot during 2019's trade wars). Assuming that the market holds up today, I'm primarily watching my current positions in NVDA/AAPL and ready to flip short if we make some ridiculously unsustainable move or if Trump changes his mind.

[**LLY (Eli Lilly)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=LLY&p=d)\-Filed lawsuits against four telehealth companies for selling unauthorized compounded versions of its GLP-1 drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound. (LLY's diabetes drug Mounjaro went into short supply in 2022, allowing pharmacies and outsourcing facilities to produce the treatment, a practice called compounding). These drugs generated over $16.4B in revenue last year. Interestingly enough I see this case as pretty major despite not moving the stock significantly today, deciding whether GLP-1 is essentialy ""genericized"" to the point where any company can sell it or only the original developers of the drug. NVO might face the same thing in the future. If LLY loses, that's a huge blow for both of them.

[**HTZ (Hertz)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HTZ&p=d)\-The potential rollback of tariffs by the Trump administration could negatively impact Ackman's thesis that used cars are more valuable due to tariffs.

I'm interested in shorting the stock if we make a parabolic move up or if we fail to break $9 (but as always, it's dependent on how we get there). Automotive rental companies have benefited from higher used car values amid tariff-induced supply constraints.

2025-04-22 20:13:09,Tesla,TSLA,Tesla reports disappointing quarterly results as automotive revenue plunges 20%,"Tesla reported a miss on the top and bottom lines in its first-quarter earnings report on Tuesday as automotive revenue plunged 20% from a year earlier.

Here are the key numbers compared with LSEG expectations.

* **Earnings per share**: 27 cents adjusted vs. 39 cents estimated
* **Revenue**: $19.34 billion vs. $21.11 billion estimated

Total revenue slid 9% from $21.3 billion a year earlier. Automotive revenue dropped 20% to $14 billion from $17.4 billion in the same period last year.

Tesla said one reason for the decline was the need to update lines at its four vehicle factories to start making a refreshed version of its popular Model Y SUV. The company also pointed to lower average selling prices and sales incentives as a drag on revenue and profit.

Net income plummeted 71% to $409 million, or 12 cents a share, from $1.39 billion or 41 cents a year ago.

It’s been a brutal start to the year for Tesla, with CEO Elon Musk spending much of his time in President Donald Trump’s White House, overseeing an effort to dramatically downsize the federal government. The president’s sweeping tariffs plan has led to concerns that costs will increase for parts and materials crucial for electric vehicle production, including manufacturing equipment, automotive glass, printed circuit boards and battery cells.

Tesla shares are down 41% so far in 2025, and suffered their worst quarterly drop since 2022 in the period that ended in March. The stock was little changed in extended trading on Tuesday.

The company refrained from promising growth this year and said it will “revisit our 2025 guidance in our Q2 update.”

In its shareholder deck, Tesla cautioned investors that “uncertainty in the automotive and energy markets continues to increase as rapidly evolving trade policy adversely impacts the global supply chain and cost structure of Tesla and our peers.” The company said this “dynamic,” and “changing political sentiment” could have a meaningful near-term impact on demand for its products.

Tesla has faced widespread protests in the U.S. and Europe, where Musk has actively supported Germany’s far-right AfD party. Earlier this month, the company reported a 13% decline in first quarter deliveries from a year earlier to 336,681.

Tesla has been struggling to keep pace with lower-cost competitors in China, and is a laggard in the robotaxi market, which is currently dominated in the U.S. by Alphabet’s Waymo. The company has promised to launch its first driverless ride-hailing offering in Austin, Texas, in June.

The company reassured investors on Tuesday that it remains on track for a “pilot launch” in Austin by that point, and to begin building its humanoid robots on a pilot production line in Fremont, California, this year.

Operating income in the quarter slid 66% to $400 million from $1.17 billion a year earlier, resulting in a 2.1% operating margin. The company cited an increase in expenses tied to artificial intelligence projects as one factor in the decline.

The company would have lost money on automotive sales without environmental regulatory credits during the quarter. Revenue from the credits, which Tesla receives for selling fully electric vehicles, increased to $595 million from $432 million in the same quarter last year.

Energy generation and storage revenue jumped 67% in the quarter to $2.73 billion from $1.64 billion a year ago. The company said growth in AI infrastructure is “creating an outsized opportunity for our Energy storage products to stabilize the grid, shift energy when it is needed most and provide additional power capacity.”

Tesla uses foreign suppliers for its energy business. The company said “increasing tariffs may cause market volatility and near-term impacts to supply and demand.”

I think the only thing that sends the stock soaring is if Elon uses the call to publicly announce he's stepping down from DOGE and devoting 100% of his efforts to TSLA.

2025-04-22 15:36:08,Tesla,TSLA,Tesla Earnings: Two predictions and what to watch for after.,"Position: I am short on Tesla.

Apparently, Elon is going to talk today: [Elon Musk breaks his own Tesla (TSLA) earnings rule in desperate move](https://electrek.co/2025/04/21/elon-musk-breaks-tesla-tsla-earnings-rule-desperate-move/)

We all know what this is about: Building hype to distract from the endless onslaught of bad news for Tesla. Elon is going to deploy his ERDF (Elon Reality Distortion Field) to pump up his meme stock. This comes as no surprise to anyone here. 

Prediction #1: Taking the likely prediction from the Tesla bulls, Elon will tell investors the same old story of Tesla becoming ""not-a-car-company"" anymore and to completely ignore all of 2025. (Source: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2025-largely-doesnt-matter-tesla-113124531.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2025-largely-doesnt-matter-tesla-113124531.html) ). Also, not really a big stretch of the imagination here. 

Prediction #2: Just for fun, I will make a very specific prediction of how Elon will use his ERDF to dazzle the mouth breathers into dumping more money into his meme stock. I expect that he will roll out the Optimus. It will do the following tasks, in order:

1. Perform some silly preprogrammed maneuver that makes it look like it is self-aware. It will look at it's hands or something similar to make it look like it has ""intelligence"" and ""awareness"". Just watch the dumb video they have already put out there.
2. Elon will throw a bunch of small, non-fragile, objects out on a flat surface and say: ""*Now watch this!*"". 
3. The robot will quickly grab each small object, maybe something like a domino, and arrange them quickly in an ordered fashion. It might even flick the first one to knock down the chain. 
4. Controlled remotely by a human off stage, the robot will wave goodbye to a choreographed verbal prompt from Elon and then walk off the stage. Maybe it will even do a little dance for us. 
5. The bleating sheep will go nuts and the stock will pop. 
6. End sham demo. 
7. Begin hand-waving and tech-jargon spewing to explain away endless mounting problems for Tesla. 

I predict this because of Elon's long history of stage-hyped vaporware demos. This will be really easy for him to pull off because they can just rip a few sensors and software out of the common pick-and-place robots already used in their production lines and quickly cobble them into the Optimus. It is going to look just like the pre-canned routines production robots run at manufacturing trade shows but for dimwits that have never been to one and think this is all ""new"" technology. 

Most importantly: This will gloss over the inconvenient fact that any ""brand damage"" Elon has caused Tesla, will also surely impact the sales of any other consumer product they will launch in the future. For example, an obscenely expensive robot that will likely be unable to scramble an egg for you. 

The whole ""Tesla is not-a-car-company anymore"" earnings (so ignore the lack of earnings) show will also gloss over the fact that, like everything else ""new"" at Tesla, it is an old idea and they are way behind the competition (e.g., Waymo/Google in the Robotaxi space). The idea of a car company making humanoid robots was first put out there by Honda with ASIMO over a quarter century ago. They developed it. There was no consumer market for it. So, they repurposed it. There still isn't a consumer market here (longer discussion). And there is already a second generation of advanced humanoid robots for manufacturing from a company called [Figure building BMW's in Spartanburg, SC](https://www.bmwgroup.com/en/news/general/2024/humanoid-robots.html). Let's also just ignore all the more advanced humanoid robots coming out of China just like we are told to ignore BYD that just surpassed Tesla without even having access to the US market. If Elon says it's the future, it ""Musk"" be true, and Tesla will somehow be the ***only*** company in the world doing it. 

Will Tesla's stock pop today? Probably. But who really knows with any meme stock. Performance and numbers haven't mattered at all in the past for Tesla. Retail investors are just a herd of bleating sheep that will easily get caught up in the ERDF. What I am going to be looking for is 45 days from the end of Q1 when the data from the 13F Forms comes out. Watching what the big institutional investors are doing will really be telling. I strongly suspect, given previous reports of retail investors buying up [Tesla like never before](https://www.investopedia.com/why-teslas-stock-soars-despite-car-sales-numbers-11705040), that the institutional investors are going to slowly reduce their positions in Tesla and orchastate themselves a nice soft landing on the backs of gullible retail investors. Given that institutional investors hold about half the company, I predict that this news is what will really drive the stock price for the foreseeable future.

News: [Trump's Trade War Puts Us Dollar Bonds Safe Haven Status At Risk](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-04-21/trump-s-trade-war-puts-us-dollar-bonds-safe-haven-status-at-risk)

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d) \- Tesla is set to report Q1 2025 earnings today after market close. Analysts anticipate EPS of $0.41 and revenue of $21.54B, reflecting a 13% YoY decline in deliveries to \~337K units. TSLA faces challenges from declining EV sales, brand damage, and potential impacts from new auto tariffs. I'm mainly interested in sub-$200 buys as a small reversal trade, not sure if I'll take a short position prior to earnings. Not interested in trading if the earnings are good. Risks include continued decline in deliveries, margin compression, and potential regulatory impacts from tariffs. Something else I'm interested in listening for is lessened political risk- if Elon is announcing an actual step down from DOGE then that might help the stock.

[**SEDG (SolarEdge)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SEDG&p=d) / [**FSLR (First Solar)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FSLR&p=d) \- The U.S. has finalized tariffs up to 3,521% on solar imports from Southeast Asia, targeting countries like Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. Most of our solar capability is imported from SE Asian countries. This move is meant to protect domestic manufacturers like SEDG and FSLR. Not too interested in this as a day trade, more as a swing trade.

[**NOC (Northrop Grumman)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NOC&p=d) \- Northrop Grumman reported a 49% drop in Q1 profit, with EPS of $3.32 vs. $6.32 YoY, due to a $477M charge related to the B-21 stealth bomber program. Revenue fell 7% YoY to $9.47B, missing expectations. Overall, many defense companies are losers from tariffs due to rising production costs and shifting geopolitical dynamics. Companies like NOC are under pressure to manage expenses while maintaining strategic programs which are essentially impossible due to tariffs. Risks include escalating costs in defense projects, potential delays in government contracts, and geopolitical uncertainties.

[**JKS (JinkoSolar)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=JKS&p=d) \- JinkoSolar, with U.S. manufacturing capabilities, stands to benefit from the new tariffs on Southeast Asian solar imports. Despite initial market reaction, the company's domestic presence positions it favorably in the current trade environment. FSLR and other domestic producers cannot manufacture the entire US's solar needs by themselves- JKS is likely to pick up the slack with their own manufacturing. But frankly, FSLR/ENPH/domestic producers are safer trades IMO.

[Gold](https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/investing/article/gold-price-today-wednesday-april-16-2025-gold-opens-with-new-high-134956304.html) has surpassed the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks as the most crowded trade on Wall Street as the precious metal surged to record highs this year amid volatile markets and an uncertain economic backdrop.

According to the latest Bank of America fund managers survey published this week, nearly half of the fund managers surveyed (49%) see long gold, or bets that gold prices will rise, as the most crowded trade in the market right now. This marks the first time in two years that fund managers did not see the Magnificent Seven as Wall Street's most crowded trade, according to the survey.

2025-04-15 03:00:20,Tesla,TSLA,How bad is this for TSLA?,"Tesla is facing significant pressure to address a major shortfall in its Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology.
Approximately 4 million vehicles equipped with the Hardware 3 (HW3) computer- installed in Teslas produced from April 2019 through late 2023-are unable to achieve the promised unsupervised autonomous driving capabilities. This revelation contradicts Tesla's earlier assurances that all vehicles produced since 2016 had ""all the hardware necessary for full self-driving capability.""

In January 2025, CEO Elon Musk acknowledged that HW3 lacks the necessary processing power for full autonomy. He stated that Tesla would need to upgrade the computers in vehicles of customers who purchased the FSD package. This admission has sparked discussions about potential compensation or hardware upgrades for affected owners.

The situation is further complicated by (HW4) computers. In early 2025, Tesla recalled over 200,000 vehicles due to HW4 units short-circuiting, leading to failures in safety features like rearview cameras. The company is addressing these problems through over-the-air software updates and, when necessary, hardware replacements.

Given the scale of the HW3 issue and the costs associated with potential retrofits or compensation, this could become one of the most expensive recalls in automotive history. Tesla has not yet detailed a comprehensive plan for addressing the HW3 limitations across its fleet.

Now, though, those ties have become a liability for the electric-vehicle maker. People are vandalizing Tesla dealerships, charging stations and cars driven by its customers. Even those who aren't actively boycotting the brand may be deterred from owning a Tesla right now.

The company is heavily consumer-facing. About 77% of its revenue comes from consumer vehicles, and Tesla also sells energy products to consumers. So brand sentiment and its impact on sales matters. The truth is, very few high-profile brands have seen backlash and political boycotts to the degree Tesla is now experiencing.

Bud Light serves as one example, but to a lesser extent. Following an April 2023 boycott of Bud Light, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA's (BE:ABI) stock tumbled by about 16% in a little over a month. Sales for Bud Light haven't recovered. So gauging the fallout from backlash against Tesla ahead of its future earnings could be difficult.

Bob Lang, founder and chief strategist at Explosive Options, suggests turning to soft data to try and determine how consumers feel about the brand. A survey by YouGov from March showed that 37% of respondents said that Musk is either part of or wholly the reason they wouldn't consider owning or leasing a Tesla.

What does the data tell us about Tesla's stock?

Its technicals look rough

If you're a trader, you could probably resort to an endless number of indicators to gauge short term moves. But for longer-term investors, the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages matter because they show long-term trends.

As of Friday morning, Tesla was near the ""death cross"", which is when the 50-day moving average falls below the 200-day moving average, a bearish signal.

""Why is that significant? It means that big institutional money is going to think twice about buying below this after the crossover is done,"" Lang said.

Below is a chart from FactSet that shows the near cross of the 50-day moving average to the 200-day moving average as of Friday's close. At current rates, the 50-day can cross over the 200-day on Monday.",244,93,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jxvwyf/teslas_stock_is_set_for_a_death_cross_on_monday/

2025-04-10 18:43:31,Tesla,TSLA,Tesla Skyrockets Over 22% In A Single Day: Massive dual blast from the ERDF annihilates bears.,"Well... It's time for a little self-deprecating humility and humor. 

Position: I am short on Tesla (still). Yesterday sucked.

In two of my previous posts on r/stocks ""**Tesla Hidey Hole (Richmond, VA)- Don't believe the numbers tomorrow but the ERDF is real.**"" and **""Forbes: ""Elon Musk's pet project- the dumpster driving Tesla Cybertruck..."" is one of biggest flops in automotive history.**"" I shared my ever growing conspiracy theory predicting the downfall of Tesla based on three things:

1. The ERDF.
2. Unscrupulous accounting that cloaks poor performance.
3. And the downfall of Tesla will eventually be caused by the human element.

Here is how it went down and what we can all learn:

Yesterday, after seeing the ego-fueled feud breaking out between Elon and Navarro (predictable), I desperately continued to search the deep, dark corners of the internet looking for anything to feed my confirmation bias in an attempt to make myself feel better about taking such a risky short position. Then it happened. Just what I was looking for. At **10:06am**, it is announced by Eletrek that Tesla's Director of Accounting Controllership, Harsh Rungta, is leaving the company:

Source: [Tesla’s top financial controller leaves (TSLA) ](https://electrek.co/2025/04/09/tesla-top-financial-controller-leaves-tsla/)

I think: ""*This is it. It's finally happening!*"". All the pieces are fitting together. Not only is does this fit with my zany prediction (a key person leaving from the accounting side), Harsh Rungta is a former PwC guy (Tesla's independent accounting firm), so he probably has buddies inside that are telling him to jump ship before it sinks. I throw on my tinfoil hat, lick my lips, and wait for the stock to start dropping. 

**10:10am:** Sinister looking faceless people in black downhill bicycle racing helmets wearing gloves start pulling levers and pushing illuminated buttons. The bears don't know it yet- but we are doomed.

**Soon thereafter- ERDF Blast #1 goes off:** My news feed starts getting hit with reports of Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh reiteraterating his ""outperform"" rating. A rating solely based on the same old tired and empty promises of the same old ripped-off concepts of future vaporware that will turn Tesla into ""not-a-car-company"" (some day), while lowering his massively inflated target price to something appearing slightly more sane to insane people. All the while, conveniently downplaying all the rising competition, trade war implications, and brand destruction happening in plain sight (per usual for these analysts). 

\*Shit- not looking good now\*

**1:18pm:** A second massive blast from the ERDF is released by Trump on Truth Social, announcing a 90-pause in the tariffs. But not for China. They are getting hit with a 125% increase and escalation to escalate the trade-war. (But that doesn't matter. Even though it really does). 

**1:20pm:** The ERDF generates a massive disturbance in the Force (aka- the stock market). Millions of bears suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. *Something terrible has happened.*

What did we learn? Two important things:

1. Headlines beat undercurrents every time. 
2. The ERDF has grown more powerful than anything anyone could have ever imagined. 

For those that want to know: The ""Elon Reality Distortion Field"", or ERDF, is a real thing that I completely made up to make you laugh. 

**The ERDF- What it is and how works:** The EDRF is a headline generating and hype boosting force with unparalleled power. It can use it's force to pull in suckers from all over the world with a single blast and get them to dump money into Tesla stock. It can be used to elevate meme stocks and keep them going up regardless of reality. It is so powerful, that even smart people who understand it's power but don't believe in the company will invest in Tesla stock, knowing there is an endless supply of suckers (and maybe short sellers to squeeze). 

First, it was just Elon capturing the imaginations of people with his vision of a high tech, sporty, eco-friendly, EV with his theatrical stage shows (back when everyone thought he was cool). Then, it grew into something with the power of a Star Destroyer fleet after Elon made a massive (but deliberate) investment to acquire Twitter and change it to X. Now, X is a gargantuan social media platform of purchased/hijacked users which has been transformed into a massive Elon-only-world-view amplifier for the ERDF (i.e., it is highly censored to fit his narrative). Then it grew into a force as strong as a Death Star surrounded by a fleet of Star Destroyers when Elon and Trump pulled a Voltron and combined forces as POTUS and owners of two separate social media companies. Elon would like to use his ERDF to reshape the entire world in his own image now. And sadly, for us mortals, the force of the ERDF has indeed taken over the entire world.

\*Except Wisconsin. The odor of cheese is the only thing that can repel the ERDF and muskrats are terrified of badgers. Coincidence? I think not...

I find the timing of analysts reiterating the same bullish ratings, news, fake news, and social media posts more than a little suspicious. We all know we are being jerked around but the magnitude of swings all this is causing is ridiculous. The markets were tested to see how they would react to a pause in tariffs with fake news, numbers were crunched, then it happened for real. 

Both Trump and Elon openly grift on crypto and I see this as a continuation of a behavior pattern that has worked for them in the past, just using the stock markets. And they aren't even trying to hide their conflicts of interest anymore. Owning your own social media company, where you, as the POTUS, post news releases that create massive, record-breaking intraday swings in the global markets based on reckless, off-the-cuff decisions you are making on the fly, thereby boosting the number of users on your platform by offering an exclusive source of information that has massive and immediate impact on the largest and fastest flows of money in the entire history of the world, is just a slight conflict of interest don't you think? *\*I used 7-commas in that run-on sentence.* 

The thing I find most interesting, is many of the companies that shot waaaaay up (e.g., Tesla, Apple, Nvidia, etc.) should have been completely hammered with the announcement of tariff increases on China. All of these companies have manufacturing and supply chains that are heavily dependant on China and the trade war with them is only escalating. Tesla got a double boost yesterday during all the madness when it should have been a double whammy. As explained by one person that gets paid to write about such matters: 

""*I say I’m not sure why Tesla also surged on this news, but it’s mainly because it’s a meme stock now. It doesn’t really trade on its actual earnings potential.*

*Also, Tesla shareholders appear to be clueless about what’s happening.*""

As wiser Obi-Wan Kenobi-like Redditors have warned on my previous posts: ""Stay away from Tesla. It's a meme stock."" They know and respect the power of the ERDF. And as Elon himself has said: ""*There is a large graveyard filled with my enemies. I do not wish to add to it, but will if given no choice.*"" He's not wrong when it comes to short sellers . Also remember: Porkins didn't survive the attack on the Death Star. This next wave of shorties probably won't either. But if fundamentals, actual product sales, brand destruction, and real numbers start mattering to Tesla, the ERDF might come down. That is our only hope.

I don't currently have access to the information, but i would imagine that a sudden - truly unexpected - drop in a blue chip value stock like TSLA would cause an institutions balance sheet to become very lopsided. I'm thinking the current sell off is due to deleveraging against short positions.

Tarrifs are ugly... political and civil unrest - sure... a bit scary, but that seems to have been fuel to the fire as the match was being lit.

Check my thoughts -  but I truly think EM may have gaffe'd the biggest gaffe that has ever been gaffed. Yes, no? Teslas market cap is down close to half a trillion dollars. That is huge.

2025-04-04 15:20:29,Tesla,TSLA,"CMV: Trump's tariffs are political weapons intentionally designed to create leverage over nearly every country, industry, and company.","I've seen a lot of discussion here about why Trump is doing these tariffs. For example, I've seen:    

1. He is doing this to bring manufacturing back to the U.S.A.  
2. He is doing this to ""punish"" countries for their tariffs and trade imbalances on and with the U.S.A.   
3. He doesn't know what he's doing, and is dumb and/or short-sighted.  
  
While I see where the logic for these explanations is coming from, I think there is a very real chance that the true explanation is that **Trump's tariffs are a political weapon, designed to give him leverage over nearly every country, industry, and company.** By instituting tariffs, rather than just threatening them, now the clock is ticking: countries, industries, and companies are frantically trying to figure out what to do.     
  
Think about it: first, Trump went after universities, threatening to withhold funding unless they caved to his demands about diversity and pro-Palestinian protestors. This has already forced major institutions, like Columbia, to bend the knee to him.  
  
Then, Trump went after big law firms and their clients, threatening through Executive Orders to cut off their access and intimidate them. This has already resulted in major law firms (Paul Weiss and Skadden) to forge ""settlements"" to do free pro bono work to the President's bidding, though luckily some of these firms (Perkins Coie) have had the integrity to fight back and sue.   
  
Following this logic, it follows that Trump with his tariffs doesn't legitimately believe what he is telling the public about his intentions. Far more likely, I think, that he is using these tariffs to force pledges of loyalty, concessions, and ""deals"" with countries, industries, and companies. 

This is not my original idea, to be fair; I heard it from U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D - Connecticut). He has pointed out that democratically-elected leaders turned despot/authoritarian/fascist will use tools like this to maintain power. Trump knows he cannot be reelected due to term limits, so how does he hold on to power? Like this. It is a slippery slope towards becoming a dictator. 
 
I can only hope that some countries/industries/companies see through this B.S. and fight back, but it is likely that many—now that their finances are being hurt—will bend the knee. 

Going back to the common explanations for Trump's tariffs, here are my counterarguments:    

1. If this was intended to bring manufacturing back to the U.S.A., that doesn't make a lot of sense. Companies aren't just going to upend decades of supply chains to invest billions into a country whose people don't want a lot of dirty, hard-work manufacturing jobs, especially when everything could (likely) revert back when Trump is out of office in 4 years.   
2. I won't pretend to be an economist, but a big reason for the trade imbalances is because Americans like buying stuff from XYZ countries. That isn't those countries' fault, necessarily. And moreover, the chart Trump showed at the White House Rose Garden this week did not accurately reflect the actual tariff rates that foreign countries place on the U.S.A—it included trade imbalances, which makes zero sense and is highly misleading, if not an outright lie.   
3. Trump may appear dumb, but he has scores of well-planned sycophants from groups like the Heritage Foundation (Project 2025 authors) that are advising him. It is highly unlikely that they planned so much of his presidency, but the tariffs themselves were an afterthought.   
  
Now granted, we have heard rumors that the tariffs were hastily put together, and that Trump's team may have used ChatGPT to write some of the policy out. At first, this appears to support explanation no. 3. However, I think the hasty nature of these tariff policies actually supports the idea that they are purely intended as political weapons: it doesn't matter what exactly the tariffs are, what matters is creating immediate leverage.   
  
Curious for the community's thoughts. 

Disclosure: I have divested heavily from the U.S. markets and gone into EU stocks, especially defense. I am also short TSLA, DJT, and Air Canada.

**EDIT:** As seeming proof of this theory, American journalist Kara Swisher [reported on BlueSky today](https://bsky.app/profile/karaswisher.bsky.social/post/3llynh6uoyk2z) that ""Several sources tell me a passel of high profile tech and also finance leaders is making a trip to Mar-a-Lago to read Trump the riot act — um talk common sense — to him on the tariffs. Their million dollar donations to the inauguration is turning into billions in losses.""  
  
Translation, I think: executives are bending over backwards to try and get concessions from Trump. This shows he has leverage over them already.",688,494,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jreh6b/cmv_trumps_tariffs_are_political_weapons/

Tech stocks plummeted on Thursday, with Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)) leading ""Magnificent Seven"" names lower following President Trump's[ reciprocal tariff announcement](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-every-country-facing-reciprocal-tariffs-announced-by-trump-on-liberation-day-231329935.html) the day prior.

Shares of Apple, on track for their worst day since March 2020, cratered over 8% in afternoon trade as the stock erased $300 billion from its market cap. The largest risk, according to analysts, centers on the iPhone maker's overseas production hubs, which are particularly vulnerable to the tariffed countries.

On Wednesday, Trump announced tariffs that will impact some 185 countries, including the United States's largest trading partners. Additional reciprocal tariffs, for instance, will include 34% tariffs on Chinese imports, a 20% tariff on European Union imports, a 46% tariff on imports from Vietnam, 32% on imports from Taiwan, and 26% on India — all set to take effect on April 9.

Notably, the additional 34% tax on China will be added to the country's existing 20% tariff, meaning its total tariff rate will rise to 54%. China is Apple's most important [production hub](https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook-apple-supply-chain-trump-tariffs-china-diversify-iphone-2025-1?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=yahoo.com), with about 85% of its iPhones manufactured there.

""Apple produces basically all their iPhones in China, and the question will be around exceptions and exemptions on this tariff policy if those companies are building more operations, factories, and plants in the US[ like Apple announced in February](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-will-spend-more-than-500-billion-usd-in-the-us-over-the-next-four-years/),"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients following the announcement.

As trade tensions escalate, Apple has moved to increase its supply chain beyond just China, boosting manufacturing in places like India and Vietnam. But with the new tariff announcements set to impact those countries too, there's now limited room for reprieve.

""The worry will be around pricing and margin impacts along with what this means for the global supply chain looking forward,"" Ives said. For now, the analyst continues to believe major negotiations will happen over the coming months as companies attempt to navigate ""this new world of tariffs.""

Until then, he warned, ""tech stocks will clearly be under major pressure.""

Other Magnificent Seven players also faced significant selling action. In aggregate, that cohort of stocks is currently on track to eliminate over $800 billion from their collective market caps.

In afternoon trade, Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)) and Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) each fell 7%, followed by a 6% drop in both Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL)) and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)). Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)) dipped 3%, while Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)) was off just under 2%.

Outside of the Mag Seven, chip stocks faced similar declines, despite the exemption of semiconductors from Trump's additional tariffs. Nvidia competitor Broadcom ([AVGO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AVGO)), for example, erased well over $50 billion from its market cap following an 8% drop in shares.

""The implications \[of the announced tariffs\] are broad-reaching, and we see negative implications for the whole \[chip\] sector,"" KeyBanc analyst John Vinh wrote in a note to clients. ""These are most notably going to negatively impact end-demand in key markets including smartphones/iPhones and PCs, as a significant amount of manufacturing is done within China.""

Stacy Rasgon, Bernstein's managing director and senior analyst, added in an interview with Yahoo Finance that the biggest headwind for semiconductors is not necessarily the direct impact of tariffs. Rather, it's the risk of demand destruction as these products become more expensive.

He added, ""The other risk for semis is that they are very cyclical, very global, and very correlated to the macro and to GDP. [So if this tips us into recession, ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-economy-dangerously-vulnerable-to-recession-wall-street-reacts-to-tariff-fallout-155837444.html)that's probably not going to be great.""",210,63,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jqpre5/apple_sheds_300_billion_in_tarifffueled_selloff/

[**FXI (China Large-Cap ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FXI&p=d), [**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d), [**PDD (Pinduoduo)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PDD&p=d), [**JD (JD.com)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=JD&p=d) \- China is restricting domestic companies from investing in the U.S. This is significant news in that it's a ""warning shot across the bow"" from China; they're slowly starting to escalate in response to Trump's potential tariffs coming out later today. A sign of escalation and a warning, China is essentially responding in kind that it will give tariffs back (just like 2018). Reduced Chinese investment could result in less liquidity in the markets overall and larger volatility. If you want to see a reminder of how Chinese stocks performed when we got into a trade war, look at 2018-2019. We haven't a seen a meaningful move in these stocks yet, but if there are responses from China in kind to the tariff announcement today, things are going to get volatile,

[**SPY (S&P 500 ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SPY&p=d), [**QQQ (Invesco QQQ)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=QQQ&p=d), VXX, etc. - President Trump is set to unveil new tariffs today but is still finalizing details. Options include a tiered system (10%-20%) or a flat 20% global tariff. We're likely going to see a LOT of incremental headlines today on this until Trump speaks in the Rose Garden; I'll be watching what he says on the websites he posts on, and going for the speed trade on this. He is expected to talk at 4PM Eastern. Obviously, a lot of volatility and uncertainty due to no one knowing what exactly the tariff plans are going to be. The imposition of new tariffs could escalate trade tensions, leading to retaliatory measures from affected countries (which we don't know the extent of how many are affected) and impacting global economic growth.

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\- Tesla reported preliminary March China deliveries of 78.8K vehicles vs 89.1K YoY. The company has delivered 336,681 cars in the first quarter, far fewer than the 390,000 expected. The decline in Tesla's China deliveries was a bit of a signal that the global sales would be bad, but frankly this wasn't as terrible as I expected. Currently short, will cover if we break $260 to the upside. Also interested in the $250 level. You guys know the risks by now (BYD and competitors, Musk, politics, etc).

[**META**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=META&p=d), [**SNAP**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SNAP&p=d), [**GOOG**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GOOG&p=d) \- The April 5th deadline for TikTok to be sold off or face a ban is approaching, potentially leading to incremental headlines today in addition to tariff news. No real move in these stocks yet but I expect any news headline that is negative for TikTok to be great for the companies I'm watching (social media rivals). A ban on TikTok could alter the membership for the social media sites mentioned (they have to go somewhere). Since this is a weekend headline, I'm thinking of buying more GOOG- if TikTok DOES get banned, then these companies will likely gain. Otherwise, business continues as usual and they don't benefit. .",5,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jpoamx/interesting_stocks_today_042/
2025-04-02 13:10:00,Tesla,TSLA,"Tesla reports 336,000 vehicle deliveries in first quarter","Tesla reported 336,000 vehicle deliveries in the first quarter of 2025, two days after the electric vehicle company’s stock wrapped up its worst quarter since 2022.

Here are the key numbers:

* Total deliveries Q1 2025: 336,000
* Total production Q1 2025: 362,000

Investors were expecting Tesla to report deliveries of between 360,000 and 370,000 vehicles, according to StreetAccount. Tesla’s investor relations team sends a company-compiled consensus to select analysts, and said the average estimate was for around 377,590 deliveries. Prediction market company Kalshi on Tuesday released a forecast for Tesla deliveries of 352,000.

In the first quarter of 2024, Tesla reported 386,810 deliveries, and production of 433,371 vehicles.

Deliveries are the closest approximation of vehicle sales reported by Tesla but are not precisely defined in the company’s shareholder communications.

Tesla doesn’t break out sales and production by model or region. However, the company said that it produced 345,454 of its most popular Model 3 and Model Y cars and delivered 323,800 of them in the three months ending March 31.

The company reported 12,881 deliveries of its other models, including its angular steel Cybertruck.

During the quarter, Tesla faced planned, partial shutdowns in some of its factories that allowed the company to upgrade manufacturing lines to start producing a redesigned version of its popular Model Y SUV.

CEO Elon Musk recently said during an all-hands session with Tesla employees that he expects the Model Y to be the “best-selling car on Earth again this year.” 

But Tesla has to contend with an onslaught of EV competition and reputational damage. In the first quarter, the company was hit with waves of protests, boycotts and some criminal activity that targeted Tesla vehicles and facilities in response to Musk’s political rhetoric and his work as part of President Donald Trump’s second administration.

After spending $290 million to help return President Donald Trump to the White House, Musk is leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), where he’s slashing costs, eliminating regulations and cutting tens of thousands of federal jobs.

Musk, the world’s wealthiest person, has also involved himself in European politics, promoting the anti-immigrant AfD party in Germany in February’s elections. Tesla’s business on the continent is struggling.

Across 15 European countries, Tesla’s market share declined to 17.9% in the first quarter from 9.3% in the same period a year earlier, according to data tracked by EU-EVs.com. In Germany, Tesla’s market share in battery electric vehicles plummeted to 4% from about 16% over that stretch.

Tesla shares sank 36% in the first quarter, their steepest drop since the fourth quarter of 2022 and third-biggest decline in the company 15 years on the public market. The drop wiped out $460 billion in market cap.

2025-04-02 06:47:15,Tesla,TSLA,"Tesla Hidey Hole (Richmond, VA)- Don't believe the numbers tomorrow but the ERDF is real.","Before I jump into the stock related stuff, as an old, I feel it is important to preface this with a little cautionary advice. Here is my three points of ""don't be stupid"":

1. I know Richmond has a storied history of burning shit going all the way back to the Civil War- but don't burn any Teslas. It's not worth it. And it's stupid. Furthermore, you are putting first responders at risk. You will also likely get caught. At least here in Virginia, there are [cameras everywhere](https://cardinalnews.org/2025/03/28/i-drove-300-miles-in-rural-virginia-then-asked-police-to-send-me-their-public-surveillance-footage-of-my-car-heres-what-i-learned/) and Tesla's themselves will record you. It's just not worth throwing your life away no matter how mad you might be. Before you get labeled a domestic terrorist and thrown in an El Salvadorian prison, read some Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and get some perspective. He wrote from a Russian gulag after sharing his negative opinion of Stalin. We are currently on Reddit and nobody is going to jail for it.
2. Don't harass individual Tesla owners. They didn't do anything to deserve it and most likely hate what is happening as well. I know some of them. It is unreasonable to ask them to dump their daily driver at a huge loss because Elon decided to make himself into a human lighting rod.
3. I deliberately waited for the ""Tesla Takedown"" to be over before making this post so nobody would get any bright ideas. What you think is making a difference is likely to have the opposite effect from what you are hoping for. The people trying to stick it to Trump just got him more [support from billionaires](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckvvlv3lewxo) after he was convicted and if you didn't notice, $TSLA started deep in the red yesterday after the Tesla Takedown over the weekend and rallied way back and finished considerably up today. None of that moved the needle in any direction but up. Furthermore, if you burn or vandalize a Tesla, the insurance company will pay for it and just jack up all of our rates in turn. If any destroyed cars are still owned by Tesla, they will just use accounting methods to write it off. And that is one less car they don't have to sell at a time when they aren't selling many, which is the ultimate point of this post and makes a nice segue.

If you are mad about what Elon Musk is doing, or just want to make money on your $TSLA puts (like me- position disclosed), what sends a stronger message? A few burnt up Teslas or entire parking lots full of them because nobody wants to buy them? In my opinion, as well as [others with puts](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/nick-denton-interview-thiel-musk) on Tesla and think Elon has lost it, it is the latter. Speaking of which... I found one such parking lot!

First, check out the few pictures I took of the local Tesla dealership here in Richmond (just outside the city). Their lot is clearly over capacity but nothing jaw dropping. There are a few dozen vehicles on the street and in a neighboring parking lot. After I shared these with a few friends, one of them told me that there were vehicle transporters unloading new Teslas near his work, which is a few miles away from the dealership and in an area of office buildings that have nothing to do with Tesla. I checked it out and there are a lot of them stuffed in the back of the lot. It's hard to see because I took the pictures at night and the cars are spread out but there are easily over 20 Cybertrucks and probably somewhere near 50 vehicles in total.

Hidey Hole-3: [https://imgur.com/Ay3oTZh](https://imgur.com/Ay3oTZh)

Obviously, my local dealer isn't selling enough cars to keep up with their deliveries (no surprise to anyone). But the big question I have is: Are these vehicles considered ""delivered""? Tomorrow Tesla reports how many vehicles they have ""delivered"" (not the same as sold). And if you haven't been paying attention as of late, Tesla has had some questionable practices going on in [Canada with their sales](https://fortune.com/2025/03/26/elon-musk-tesla-under-investigation-canada-wrongfully-boosting-sales/) and some possible questions raised about their accounting methods with the [$1.4 billion discrepancy](https://mashable.com/article/tesla-missing-billion-dollars) in their books. Going back a little further, there was a whistleblower that reported [Tesla deliberately messes](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/12/tesla-whistleblowers-filed-complaint-to-sec-in-2021-what-it-said.html) with their delivery numbers to make it appear as if they are selling more new cars than they really are.

Point being, no matter what is reported tomorrow, I am not going to believe the numbers Tesla provides. If there are new Teslas being shoved into an obscure parking lot in my city, it has to be happening elsewhere. At some point, I suspect the vehicle overflow will get noticed in other places too. Has anyone else found a Tesla hidey hole?

Most importantly, even if the number suck tomorrow, I doubt it will make that much of a difference in the stock price because of the ERDF. What is the ERDF you ask? It is the ""Elon Reality Distortion Field"" (ERDF). And this incredibly powerful field effect is really all that matters when it comes to anything ""Elon"". It's real. And people should acknowledge it as such or risk their own peril. Nothing logical or sane applies to Elon Musk and it never has.

Edit/Update: Despite missing on deliveries, $TSLA is not really down that much. Everything is being affected from the tariff news so any impact isn't really noticeable. And the sales miss is being explained away by the Model Y refresh, as widely expected and foretold by just about every media outlet covering Tesla. No surprises in the ERDF holding $TSLA strong despite the bad news.

But not Elon. In fact, just the opposite occurred. He became, and remains to be, the richest man on Earth. This displays the tremendous power of the ERDF- It is nothing like the world has ever seen. Even more powerful than [Jewish Space Lasers](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/marjorie-taylor-greene-qanon-wildfires-space-laser-rothschild-execute.html).

The ERDF is by far and away Elon's greatest invention and achievement. If there are two things Elon should get tremendous credit for, it is knowing when to invest in the right things and building hype around them. The guy is a six-dimensional hype machine from outer space with uncanny prescience. From PayPal to SpaceX, he saw where future opportunity was being underinvested in and took it over. When it comes to Tesla, he even knew when to make it ""not a car company"". Using the power of the ERDF, he made it an AI, self-driving vehicle, taxi, and humanoid robot company just in the nick of time before sales of their actual product fell off a cliff. This company is now known as ""Tessler"". Now, it doesn't matter if they sell any cars at all. Elon is using the ERDF to sell the future and even control the presidency. And it's working. It sounds crazy as hell but we are all watching this happen in real life.

Amazingly, the ERDF has allowed Elon to stall indefinitely on all promises of delivering the future and show absolutely no meaningful results for over a half-decade. Nor is Tesla a first mover in any of their new initiatives. Waymo (Google) has already launched self-driving taxis that are available using Uber and even in buzzing around in Austin Texas, where Tesla is headquartered. The idea of humanoid robots has been around forever. And one behemoth of a car company already developed one. But that happened over a quarter century ago. The car company was Honda and the robot was called ASIMO. And nobody cared. They discontinued it in 2018. Elon's ""Optimus"" has only been seen to do preprogrammed demos that look like Boston Dynamics routines from the early 2000's (nobody cares about them either). They have also been spotted shuffling around like Joe Biden. Neither the Robotaxi or Optimus robot are anywhere close to being released. And I have strong doubts as to what utility, if any, the Optimus robot will have for anybody. All of this seems to be a distraction created by the ERDF to draw attention away from the fact that Tesla still hasn't achieved ""full"" self-driving (and [ignored LIDAR sensors](https://cleantechnica.com/2025/03/17/lidar-vs-cameras-a-giant-fail-for-tesla/)). I am expecting Elon to come out with a ""Fred Flintstone"" sedan next, with no floor that you power with your feet, and telling everyone that it will be the future of travel. If Elon says it, then it ""Musk"" be true (the guy has a name that just keeps on giving).

With no first-mover advantage in the driverless taxi space, being behind tech giant Google there, and reviving an old failed sci-fi robot idea from their much larger and more established competitor in Honda, you would think Tesla would get graded down for unoriginality. But nope. The ERDF kicks in yet again and [most analysts are bullish](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/teslas-stock-dives-as-another-bullish-analyst-worries-about-deliveries-5e90f869) and astonishingly, Cathy Wood, seemingly most affected by the ERDF (and other things that make people stupid), thinks Tesla stock is going to reach an astounding [$2,600 in five short years](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/cathie-wood-reaffirms-tesla-2-212612251.html)! That's about 10x more valuable than it is today, giving Tesla a market cap somewhere around $8.5 trillion dollars. That would make Tesla more valuable than all the other major auto manufacturers, Uber, Lyft, Google, Amazon, and Nvidia, combined in today's market (with a trillion to spare). Does that sound realistic? You can call me a skeptic of Cathy Wood...

Again, make no mistake, the ERDF is real. And if we are talking straight stock price, it matters. It might be the only thing that matters. Love him or hate him, it seems that Elon and his ERDF manufactured the most successful ad campaign in history right on the lawn of the White House. But it wasn't for the cars. It was for the stock. All the new people getting sucked into the ERDF because of Elon's new found bromance with Trump have no idea of what has been happening with Elon prior to his involvement in politics. And they don't care. They just know him as ""Tech Support"" guy and Trump's new ally. They love Trump and there is no shortage of them. They might be willing to wait another 5-years for Cathy's insane prediction to come true, not knowing everyone else had already been waiting for 5-years before them. Fresh meat so-to-speak. Tesla's 10-day average volume is over 138 million shares. And most of this is [retail traders going bonkers](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-21/tesla-s-retail-fanboys-buy-the-stock-at-a-pace-never-seen-before?embedded-checkout=true) for Tesla and Elon. It is likely that Elon has masterfully used his ERDF to transition retail stock holders from younger, tech savvy and/or environmentally conscious investors to straight up Fox News Dads in less than one quarter.

While it has already been noted on this sub that institutional investors are likely pumping $TSLA to orchestrate a soft landing for themselves (on the backs of retail investors), I don't think they can exit too quickly without causing a complete fiasco. They only have to report 30-days after each quarter ends and they trade in dark pools. So, we plebeians won't know what the big institutional holders are doing until after they have done it (unless they report sooner). And if any one big institutional investor dumps their position fast enough to spook the market, there will certainly be consequences. Both political and financial. The finances between Elon, his many ventures, and his personal loans must be a complete nightmare of both complexity and scale. While in theory Elon could be ""margin called"" for his loans that have Tesla stock put up as collateral for, I am not so sure it would happen even if the stock drops significantly. The banks just went through a crisis of confidence with the whole Silicon Valley Bank collapse. If something triggered Elon's house of cards to collapse, it could have larger implications for his lenders and they might take a lot of heat for it. And the banks certainly don't want to invite in more oversight. They might just eat the loss and hold the shares in hopes they eventually regain their value. For that reason alone, I think the chances of Elon getting margin called are slim. But I would definitely be keeping an eye on the institutional holders once they report at the end of this month to see if there are any notable changes.

Edit/Update: A few hours after posting this, it was reported that [Swedish firm Folksam](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/sustainable-finance-reporting/swedish-insurer-folksam-divests-its-tesla-shareholding-2025-04-02/) closed their entire position in Tesla. While not nearly as big as other institutional holders, it was still about $160M worth of stock. That's not chump change. (Mods: Sorry for originally using a Seeking Alpha article in the link- I didn't know they were blacklisted). 

To end this manifesto post, and give the shorts a little glimmer of hope, I offer one possibility that has not really been talked about all that much. Despite the massive power of the ERDF, some people do indeed escape it. And despite all the hype around AI, robots, and automation, Elon's companies are still run by the most unpredictable machines on the planet- humans. Tesla's long time CFO and potential successor for Elon, Zachary Kirkhorn, left suddenly in the [summer of 2023](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-cfo-zachary-kirkhorn-steps-down-replaced-by-vaibhav-taneja-2023-08-07/). Four more of Elon's top executives and direct reports left in [short order in 2024](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-loses-4-top-executives-ahead-of-robotaxi-event-2024-10). Baglino sold off his [$180 million in shares](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/25/former-tesla-svp-drew-baglino-is-selling-181point5-million-worth-of-stock.html) when he left. Not much of a vote of confidence there. And Tesla as a whole recently [fired a massive number of employees](https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/tesla-started-laying-off-14000-employees-it-couldnt-have-gone-worse.html). From the reports, Elon seemingly did it in the same smug and indifferent manner in which he fired people at Twitter and is currently doing in the federal government.

Ultimately, if people become disenfranchised and are no longer willing to do Elon's bidding, his enterprises will fail. And there is only so much you can pay people to motivate them before you lose profitability. To make a Star Wars analogy, the only way I see to bring down the ERDF that protects and surrounds Elon's seemingly unstoppable Death Star, is if people on the inside of his operations lose faith in him and get tired of his bullshit. All the people around Elon: His loyal followers on X and even president Trump to some extent, don't do anything for him but build his ego and amplify the strength of the ERDF. But none of them know how to design and build cars or launch space shuttles. That's a very small group of very intelligent people that cannot be replaced as easily as retail investors. It's the smart people on the inside that make all of Elon's visions come into reality. In the end, I think the human element might be Elon's undoing.",229,123,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jpicww/tesla_hidey_hole_richmond_va_dont_believe_the/

News: [US Stock Futures Tumble Ahead Of New Trump Tariffs: Markets Wrap ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-30/us-stock-futures-tumble-ahead-of-new-trump-tariffs-markets-wrap)

[**SPY**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SPY&p=d)**,** [**QQQ** ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=QQQ&p=d)**,** [**VXX** ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&p=d)**,** [**USO**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=USO&p=d) , larger tech stocks - ""Liberation day"" (additional tariffs) is nearing, causing the market to selloff due to fears of escalating trade tensions and potential global growth impacts . We're pretty close to near lows from 3/13 (18 days ago, lol). 

Overall will be trying to buy a bounce for a day trade if we do end up breaking, but probably will be more focused on a VXX short rather than buying the market overall. I'm interested if we selloff or pop on the open, if we break new lows I may short/then flip long. This kind of headline-driven macro environment is a pain in the ass to keep track of, but creates a lot more opportunity for short-term trading. Risks that can change the tariff narrative or move the market include unexpected retaliation from trade partners, weakening consumer/investor confidence (like last week's numbers), and spillover into energy and commodity prices (Trump has signaled some action on oil, but we aren't sure what yet). 

**NVDA**[ **(Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\- Another interesting thing that caught my eye this morning are reports from Chinese media that NVDA's new chip (GB300) are significantly delayed due to complexity and may be a quarter or two delayed (thus resulting in missed/delayed revenue). This could explain why NVDA is down significantly more (-3.5%) vs other semis. 

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d) \- Analysts have trimmed Q1 delivery estimates for TSLA amid weakening demand trends and delays in its Model Q vehicle (the cheap, Robotoaxi car). There have also been articles of divestment from pension/investing funds that are invested in TSLA that I've read, but whether those are serious, I'd hold judgement on. 

Delivery numbers are expected Wednesday and typically report premarket, so good to be cognizant of that. I'm interested in seeing if we can hold below $250 today. The EV sector in general has entered a consolidation phase, with cost competition and flagging consumer incentives weighing on demand, and BYD is hot on TSLA's heels and likely going to overtake TSLA within the year. Below-consensus deliveries could spark a guidance reset for earnings, margin compression of their other cars due to the Model Q, and market share loss in China and Europe are key concerns. Also random people torching Tesla dealerships.

[**PLTR (Palantir Technologies Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR&p=d) \- No material news catalyst, but PLTR has experienced five consecutive red sessions and is likely moving with the overall stock rout. Worth noting that PLTR cut close to 60% of its IT Team (said by CTO in recent interview), and DoD cut close to $600M in spending (which affects PLTR).

2025-03-30 16:37:34,Tesla,TSLA,Challenging the Noise: A Closer Look at Tesla's Q1 Projections,"As we have all seen, there are a ton of headlines about Tesla's (TSLA) declining sales numbers, and it's honestly a bit overwhelming. Here's a quick breakdown of what I gathered:

* Europe sales are reportedly down by 45%
* China sales have decreased by either 49% or 29%
* Australia sales are down by 65.5%

\^\^ keep in mind there are a ton of articles and headlines on this, I picked from a few \^\^

With all these headlines, it's tough to figure out what timeframes they're talking about. Is it one day, one week, three months? Who knows?

Amidst all this noise, I decided to dig deeper into what we should actually expect. While analysts' projections aren't great, they don't seem as grim as the headlines suggest.

**Global Tesla Sales (Q1):**

* **2024 Actual**: 386,810 units
* **2025 Initial Projections**: 412,000 units (median of 398K-426K range, which would've been a 6.5% increase)
* **2025 Current Projections**: 377,000 units (a 2.5% decrease from Q1 2024)
* **Projection Change**: Initial to current projections dropped by 8.5%

**USA Sales Breakdown (Q1):**

* **2024 Actual**: 140,187 vehicles
* **2025 Current Projection**: 138,867 vehicles
* **Change**: Only a 0.9% decrease in the US market

These numbers don't look great, especially for a company like Tesla that's all about growth. But we're still talking about single-digit declines quarter-over-quarter, assuming the analysts are somewhat correct.

I wanted to understand what the Q1 report might reveal because, going by the headlines, it seemed like it would be terrible. But after digging in, it doesn't seem as bad as it feels. Is it just me?

In some countries like Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands, they are down by aprox 60-70% in March 2025 compared to last year  (March 2024), even after Model Y changeover has finished.

In Norway, Tesla is once again the best seller, but it's still down by around 20% from March 2024, and the Q1 total is down around 30%.

There is currently no supply shortage, since you can order a new Model Y Juniper and get delivery almost the same day. The source for the numbers were taken from this website: [https://eu-evs.com/](https://eu-evs.com/)

One country had an increase in sales 25% (Spain).

Overall for the countries listed it was down est around 36%.

[**GME (GameStop)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME&p=d) **-** Reported earnings, EPS of $0.29 vs $0.08 expected. EPS beat estimates, and the company announced it would integrate Bitcoin into its treasury reserve. This confirms prior speculation tied to Ryan Cohen’s meeting with Strategy’s chairman. **This is a massive catalyst** solely based on the fact that if GME buys enough of the CC, we may see it trade at a premium the same way as MSTR does. (MSTR usually trades at a 2x valuation to the amount of CC it holds.). Volatility in the CC market could create swings in reported earnings, but makes GME easier to track price-wise. The core retail business still saw a 28% Y/Y decline in sales which is somewhat of a red flag. Biased positive.

**Related Tickers:** MSTR, COIN

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\- Second day of straight gains, with shares up 3.5% after a close to 50% selloff. I'm Interested in $290 level after failing to break above it in the premarket. EV sentiment remains mixed for TSLA going forward- despite weakness in European sales, investor sentiment appears to be shifting positive. Sales in Europe fell 40% Y/Y, and Canada’s EV rebate freeze adds regulatory actions into the mix. BYD is also close to overtaking TSLA, so I still don't consider this investible for the long-term (but it is tradable).

[**DLTR (Dollar Tree)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DLTR&p=d)**-** DLTR will divest its Family Dollar segment for \~$1B to Brigade Capital and Macellum, a massive markdown from the $9B it paid in 2015. The stock reacted fairly positively on this news, mainly because DLTR has been struggling since COVID. This move is an effort to clean up the balance sheet and refocus on the core business. The market probably views this favorably in the face of tariffs - less potential exposure to Family Dollar inevitably underperforming.

[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\- New energy rules in China disqualify NVDA's exportable H20 chip, threatening near-term revenue from a key market. Seen a minor selloff in NVDA of roughly $2, interested to see if we sell off more at the open. China’s energy mandates are squeezing data center hardware providers, forcing chipmakers to adapt or lose access to the market. Having the H20 not be usable is a huge blow to NVDA's revenue, as it makes up close to 10% of their revenue in 2024. More regulation or bans could further limit access to Chinese demand, other chipmakers, etc. This DOES seem targeted to have Chinese companies focus on

2025-03-25 22:14:10,Tesla,TSLA,Stocks Close Higher for 3rd Straight Day; Tesla Surges in Late Trading to Extend Rally,"
Major indexes closed slightly higher Tuesday as the stock market continued its recovery from an extended selloff.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite added 0.2% and 0.5%, respectively, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose fractionally. Stocks had kicked off the week with big gains following news that President Trump could scale back some of the tariffs that are due to be imposed next week on U.S. trading partners. With the recent gains, the Dow has inched back into positive territory for 2025, as stocks have rebounded from a month-long selloff spurred by concerns about the potential impact of tariffs and uncertainty about the outlook for the economy.

Investors brushed off consumer confidence data released this morning that came in weaker than expected, with the index hitting its lowest level in more than four years. Investors are closing watching all data points amid worries that tariffs could reignite inflation and cause economic growth to stall. The big economic report of the week comes Friday with the scheduled release of the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which had fallen during the recent stock market rout amid the growing concerns about the economy, was at 4.32% in late trading, down from 4.33% at yesterday's close and from an earlier high Tuesday of 4.37%. The yield, which affects costs on all sorts of loans, notably mortgages, hit its highest level in more than a month this morning.

Mega-cap technology stocks, which helped lead Monday's rally, were mostly higher again today. Shares of Tesla (TSLA) rallied late in the day to finish 3.5% higher, gaining ground for the 5th consecutive session, despite news Tuesday that the EV maker's sales in Europe continued to slide. Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta Platforms (META) each rose more than 1%, while Microsoft (MSFT) inched ahead. Chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) closed slightly lower

Wood told Bloomberg that she expects Tesla’s robo taxis to be the company’s biggest value driver in the next five years, and that the share price was not even factoring in Tesla’s plans for humanoid robots.

Wood’s forecast predicts Tesla’s valuation at nearly 10 times from current levels, as the EV maker grapples with a severe drop in valuation over the past four months. The $2,600 forecast has been touted by Ark in the past. 

Tesla is the biggest component of Wood’s flagship ARK Innovation (NYSE:[ARKK](https://www.investing.com/etfs/ark-innovation)) exchange-traded fund, which holds about $646 million worth of shares in the EV maker. Tesla is also by far Ark’s biggest holding across its other ETFs, according to data from Cathie’s Ark.

2025-03-24 13:22:25,Tesla,TSLA,"Volkswagen, BMW group electric cars outsell Tesla in Europe in February","(Reuters) - Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) EV sales in Europe have fallen in February behind legacy brand Volkswagen ([VOW3.DE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VOW3.DE), [VLKPF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VLKPF)) and the BMW ([BMW.DE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BMW.DE)) group, as well as rivals from China, data by research platform JATO Dynamics showed on Monday.

Elon Musk's all-electric brand is facing a loyalty test in Europe after the close ally of U.S. President Donald Trump openly supported far-right parties in the continent, including with at least two dozen posts on his X platform promoting Germany's Alternative fur Deutschland.

Musk's role in politics, rising competition in the EV market and the phasing out of the existing version of its best-selling vehicle, the Model Y, have all impacted sales, Felipe Munoz, Global Analyst at JATO Dynamics, said in a report.

""Brands like Tesla, which have a relatively limited model lineup, are particularly vulnerable to registration declines when undertaking a model changeover,"" Munoz said.

Tesla's battery-electric vehicle (BEV) registrations in 25 European Union markets, the UK, Norway and Switzerland fell on average by 44% from the same month of 2024, to under 16,000 cars sold in February. Its market share in the month fell to 9.6%, the lowest February reading in the last five years.

By comparison, Volkswagen's BEV sales were up 180% to under 20,000 cars, while the BMW brand and BMW-owned Mini, combined, sold almost 19,000 BEVs in February, the data showed.

Chinese-owned brands, combined, also sold more electric cars than Tesla, JATO Dynamics said.

BYD's ([1211.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/1211.HK), [BYDDY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BYDDY)) and Polestar's ([PSNY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PSNY)) BEV sales in the same markets were up respectively 94% and 84% to over 4,000 and over 2,000 cars. Xpeng ([XPEV](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XPEV), [9868.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/9868.HK)) sold over 1,000 cars and Leapmotor ([9863.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/9863.HK)) almost 900.

BEV sales at Geely ([0175.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/0175.HK), [GELYF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GELYF)) -owned Volvo and SAIC ([600104.SS](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/600104.SS))-owned MG, instead, dropped by 30% and 67% respectively, the data showed.

Total car sales in 25 European Union markets, the UK, Norway and Switzerland dropped by 3% to 0.97 million in February, while BEV registrations were up by 25%.

This has resulted in a market bounce and overall means that markets will likely NOT be as impacted by tariffs as they were expecting. 

The tariff game Trump is playing reminds me of that scene from the office: ""You have no idea the physical toll three vasectomies have on a person! Snip Snap! Snip Snap! Snip Snap!"" -Michael Scott. 

Anyway back to the watchlist. 

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\- Seen a significant bounce in TSLA due to the news of the lessened (supposedly) future tariffs—interested in seeing if we can break above $260 at open; otherwise, not interested and likely still will be negatively biased. This might actually be reacting a little positively due to BYD's blowout earnings. BYD reported $107B annual revenue for the year and are close to TSLA's profit! Mainly concerned in the long run about margin compression due to pricing cuts, increased competition in the EV space, macro headwinds, and of course, Elon making fork sculptures in the White House but no one appreciating them. 

[**MSTR (MicroStrategy)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MSTR&p=d)\- MicroStrategy buys 6,911 more of the underlying, now holds over 506k, currently at 2x premium. Nothing too interesting to note beyond the typical upwards move from whenever MSTR announces a buy of the underlying. We've bounced slightly off the lows, but worth noting that the underlying is also rose from news that Trump might use his gold holdings to buy more. I always keep in mind MSTR's heavy dependence on underlying performance, regulatory scrutiny, and volatility, of course. Related tickers to watch on this are RIOT and COIN/HOOD.

[**LUNR (Intuitive Machines)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=LUNR&p=d)\- Reported strong Q4 and FY24 results. Q4 revenue of $54.7M (+80% YoY) and FY24 revenue of $228.0M (nearly 3x YoY).

Backlog reached $328.3M (+22% YoY), with **projected positive run-rate Adj. EBITDA by year-end**. Overall backlog seemed to be the second most important factor, signifies that there is future revenue and they are far more financially stable than anticipated and even profitable by year end! I have a very small position long. Going to bail if we break below $7 but overall I think there are many tailwinds that can help LUNR. **L**UNR's main risks are execution risk tied to lunar missions (beginning of this month saw the stock fall close to 50% in a single day), contract delays, reliance on government funding, and high R&D intensity with limited margin buffer/no defined return. Also watching RKLB on this. 

[**AZEK (The AZEK Company)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AZEK&p=d)\- James Hardie to acquire AZEK in a cash/stock deal valued at $8.75B (including debt). AZEK holders to receive $26.45 cash + 1.034 JHX shares, totaling \~$53/share (as of premarket prices)**.** These hybrid stock/cash acquisitions can fluctuate in price because of how the acquirer pays with their own stock. Typical M&A risks apply such as integration risk, housing market softness, FX exposure (James Hardie also trades in Australia IIRC), regulatory risk, etc.

BEIJING, March 24 (Reuters) - Tesla [(TSLA.O),](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/TSLA.O) said on Monday it would release its smart driving-assistance feature in China after completing regulatory approval, following complaints that a limited-time free trial of its Full Self-Driving service had been temporarily paused.""All parties are actively advancing the relevant process and we will push it to you as soon as it is ready.

2025-03-23 14:35:01,Tesla,TSLA,"Tariffs, DOGE and Columbia — The market will crash because Trumpism is not capitalism","There is a lot of talk, in this subreddit and just about everywhere, about how the tariffs are going to affect stock prices. I think the bigger factor is that Trumpism is not capitalism. This government has asserted its right to cancel contracts and grants, and the right to use all means at its disposal to impose policy on non-government entities. One example: NIH grants have been canceled because they were interpreted (apparently by someone who probably did not even read them, and certainly doesn’t understand them) as being no longer in line with the priorities of this government. These are multimillion dollar projects on topics like cancer, autism and shingles. They were funded after a careful competitive review by scientists, and they were stopped after much of the money was spent. It’s half-finished bridges. You can no doubt provide many examples yourself. If you can’t, ask in the comments. My point here is that under Trumpism the government will abandon contracts at will, and will use the threat of cancellation to micromanage state and local government, and corporations. 

The cases of Columbia and Maine illustrate that this government has replaced the rule of law with rule by one man. In both cases, Trump asserted the right to dictate policy normally left to the University (regarding the limits of free speech on campus) or to the state (regarding trans-gender athletes), and found ways to enforce that. I don’t yet know of a case where this government directly managed a company, but I’m sure it will come; he has the tools (the threat of cancellation of government contracts, or exemptions from tariffs, to name two). The threat of arbitrary and capricious directives from this government, coupled with the inability to rely on contracts being honored, is going to destroy profits. Milton Friedman, the famed Chicago school economist, argued that democracy, economic freedom and the rule of law are essential for prosperity. We no longer have those things. Let me give you three examples. 

I have significant holdings in MRNA, Moderna. Their mRNA technology allows the rapid development of custom drugs, not only vaccines, but drugs to treat cancer and many other diseases. They demonstrated that they can deliver during the covid-19 pandemic, and many estimates hold that RNA vaccines saved over 10 million lives. This is a great American company, and it should be ascendent, but its stock price is currently beaten down by the reasonable expectation of politically based resistance to mRNA vaccines from the Trump administration. 

TSLA was one of last year’s magnificent seven and rose even higher when Trump was elected because of the expectation that the CEO Elon Musk’s close personal relationship with the president would pay off. Now, it has fallen along with Musk’s popularity. People realize that DOGE found precious little waste and fraud but compromised many valued functions of government. To my point here, the value of TSLA stock is entirely dependent on Trump’s continued favor. If there are many government contracts, it will probably recover. If there is a falling out after Trump finally finds it necessary to blame Musk for the obvious problems with DOGE, then it will not. In either case, this is not a free market. 

Finally, I want to mention Boeing. Trump personally announced on Friday that Boeing had been selected to build the F-47 jet fighter, a contract potentially worth $50 billion. So far so good, but he’s making it clear that he decides. I expect this contract to specify everything from who Boeing can purchase parts from, to DEI policies, to whether someone given the name Charles at birth can go by Chuck.

My question, “Should I pull out of at least my M7 (already cashed out TSLA) from the market to cash and reenter well after April 6th?”  So at this point I’m up on all my long term stocks ranging from 39% to 167% as I’ve been is a long time. So nothing would be at a loss. I just feel we are facing a man made intentional potential crash of US stocks. Could be short term or long term. One issue, I’m also near retirement age so I don’t have 20 years to wait for a correction. 
Let me further say all my eggs are not in one basket. I’m fully diversified with only 1/3 of my liquid assets in stock. Because of my age 2/3 is in very safe such as CD’s near 5%. Also 2 houses paid off, nice car paid off, zero debt on credit cards paid off monthly. 
But I can’t make a misstep. My portfolio will be 1/2 of the income I will rely on for income in a few years. 


I know we are not supposed to make rash decisions based on “feelings” but it’s more than that, I’m reading nonstop everything about this market and as an older person I feel like I’m seeing a potential 2008 all over again. I wisely went cash then. And in 2010 bought my house for only  42% of it was valued in 2006. Now it’s worth 5 times what I paid for it.

2025-03-21 00:54:15,Tesla,TSLA,Short sellers have made $15 billion betting against Tesla and Nvidia in 2025,"Short sellers have been cleaning up to start 2025 amid a massive sell-off in some of the market's most popular names over the past two years.

Short sellers have made a combined $15 billion betting against Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) stock thus far this year, according to data from S3 Partners. Tesla shorts alone have raked in nearly $11 billion, while bets against Nvidia have brought in more than $4 billion.

Tesla's 40% year-to-date drop has led the declines of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks. Investors have grown concerned about CEO Elon Musk's focus on government efficiency efforts and how his role with President Trump's administration could be a turnoff to the electric vehicle maker's customer base.

But it hasn't just been Tesla lagging. As an index, the Magnificent Seven — which also includes Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) — is underperforming the S&P 500 this quarter by the most since 2022.

Short sellers have profited off of all of the names in the cohort this year. They've brought in nearly $5 billion betting against Apple stock, which is down nearly 14% in 2025.

The crash in the most popular trade of the past two years comes as investors have been re-rating their growth expectations. Fears of slowing economic growth and the impact of Trump's tariff policies have weighed on markets. Meanwhile, Big Tech has faced growing investor criticism about its ballooning AI spend and whether or not it will eventually boost future profits as much as Wall Street hopes. The year also included a massive drawdown in some large tech names, including Nvidia, following the release of a cheaper AI model from Chinese company DeepSeek.

Now, with most of the names sitting around 20% off their recent 52-week highs, the looming question for markets is whether or not investor appetite for the stocks that led the market higher for the past two years will return.

""Maybe these tech stocks got ahead of their skis a little bit,"" BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski told Yahoo Finance last week. ""But at the end of the day, these are monster companies that define the growth trajectory for the United States stock market. They are not going away.""

2025-03-21 00:51:05,Tesla,TSLA,Exclusive-Tesla trade-ins on pace for record high amid Musk backlash,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Motorists have traded in a record number of Tesla (TSLA) electric vehicles this month, Edmunds data showed, amid a wave of protests against CEO Elon Musk's work as an adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump.

Tesla cars from model year 2017 or newer accounted for 1.4% of all the vehicles traded in until March 15, up from 0.4% in March last year, according to data provided to Reuters by Edmunds. Analysts at the national car shopping website said that share could grow through the second half of the month.

In February, the Trump administration's first full month, Teslas made up 1.2% of vehicles traded in.

March's trade-ins so far would be the highest monthly share Edmunds has on record of Tesla trade-ins toward new or used purchases at dealerships, if the trend continues. This excludes trade-ins toward new purchases of Teslas and EVs from other direct-to-consumer brands.

Musk is leading the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency and activists across the U.S. have staged so-called Tesla Takedown demonstrations over his role in cuts to the federal workforce and cancellation of contracts that fund global humanitarian programs.

Social media has been rife with posts from Tesla owners in the U.S. and some European countries showing them giving up their vehicles in displays of anger toward Musk.

The March data on Tesla trade-ins has not been previously reported.

""Brand loyalty is becoming a bigger question mark as factors such as Elon Musk's increasing public involvement in government, Tesla depreciation concerns and its increased saturation in major metro areas leave some longtime owners feeling disconnected from the brand,"" said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds' head of insights.

Spokespersons for Tesla and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Tesla has said it expects the vehicle business to return to growth this year, after a small drop in 2024.

Prices of used Teslas have dropped in line with other EVs from Ford, Kia and Hyundai, according to Edmunds.

Used Tesla prices will likely decline further as Tesla trade-ins that are undergoing reconditioning reach the market, Edmunds analysts said.

Anger against the brand has resulted in Tesla vehicles being set on fire and damage to the company's showrooms and charging stations.

Trump has said he would label such attacks as domestic terrorism.

Tesla stock, which skyrocketed since Trump's election in November on hopes it would be easier for the company to roll out robotaxis under the new administration, has nearly halved from its January peak.

Fred McKinney, a corporate consultant, traded in his 2018 Tesla Model 3 last month to show his disapproval of Musk.

""I thought about putting a bumper sticker on my car saying, 'I hate Musk.' But selling the car feels so much better,"" he said on a LinkedIn post. ""If you are considering a new EV, under no circumstances consider buying a Tesla.""

Data from Edmunds also showed shoppers' consideration of new Teslas dropped to 1.8% last month - the lowest level since October 2022 - after peaking at 3.3% in November.

Tesla's sales likely fell 10% in February, hurt by declines in its Cybertruck pickup, Model 3 sedan, and Model Y SUV, separate estimates from market research firm Cox Automotive showed on Thursday.

""These shifts in Tesla consumer sentiment could create an opportunity for legacy automakers and EV startups to gain ground,"" Caldwell said.

""As Tesla brand loyalty and interest waver, those offering competitive pricing, new technology, or simply less controversy could capture defecting Tesla owners and first-time EV buyers.""

The stock fell 1.3% in premarket trading Thursday, and was on track to suffer a record-long nine-week losing streak.

Ives stuck to his outperform rating on the stock, but said the future of the EV maker depends on a major change of course from Musk.

Ives has long been a bull on Tesla, holding the highest stock price target among Wall Street analysts at $550. That implies a 133% upside to Wednesday’s closing price of $235.86.

2025-03-20 06:08:52,Tesla,TSLA,A Deeper Dive on Trump's Tariffs and Market Positioning,"Trump’s latest trade policies are hammering the markets—S&P 500 down \~9%, Nasdaq off \~12%—and it looks like he’s doubling down. Tariffs on China, Canada, Mexico, and the EU are back on the table, with zero indication that he’s backing down. While some sectors (steel, domestic manufacturing) stand to benefit, others (tech, autos, multinational retailers) are getting crushed. The question is: at what point does the market pain force Trump to change course?

The **2025 Trade Policy Agenda** lays out his vision:

✅ **Tariffs as leverage** – forcing trade partners into more “reciprocal” deals

✅ **USMCA review (2026)** – questioning whether Canada & Mexico are benefiting unfairly

✅ **Hardline stance on China** – blaming it for the U.S. trade deficit and pushing for stricter enforcement of trade agreements

His strategy? **Drive U.S. production up, cut reliance on imports, and force foreign partners to play by his rules.** But markets are worried about **inflation, supply chain disruption, and retaliatory tariffs**—all of which are starting to bite.

Not every company is hurting—some stand to **benefit significantly** from Trump’s protectionist approach. Trump’s tariffs **shield domestic manufacturers from foreign competition**, making U.S. steel, aluminum, and energy companies prime beneficiaries. E.g 

* **U.S. Steel** X 25% steel tariffs will boost profits
* **Cleveland-Cliffs** CLF Increased demand for domestic steel
* **Nucor** NUE Largest U.S. steel producer, stronger pricing power
* **Anheuser-Busch** BUD Domestic production = insulated from trade costs
* **Prologis** PLD Companies stockpiling goods = warehouse demand surge
* **Lockheed Martin** LMT Defense spending likely to rise under Trump
* **Marathon Petroleum** MPC Energy independence push favors domestic refiners

Companies with **complex supply chains** and reliance on **overseas production** are getting squeezed by **higher input costs and potential retaliatory tariffs**.E.g

* **Apple** AAPL Major China exposure, supply chain at risk
* **Tesla** TSLA Higher costs across supply chain, could hurt margins
* **General Motors** GM Tariffs on parts increase manufacturing costs
* **Ford** F Supply chain disruptions could impact production
* **Nike** NKE Manufacturing in China = higher import costs
* **Amazon** AMZN Increased cost of goods from global suppliers
* **Boeing** BA Risk of Chinese retaliation cutting aircraft orders 

Are you positioning for a **domestic manufacturing boom**, or do you think **this trade war will spiral into a full-blown recession**? Should we be **buying the dip** in industrials or **shorting overexposed multinationals**?

  
Trump’s strategy is clear: use **tariffs as a multipurpose weapon**, not just for trade but also for **immigration and national security**. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick hinted that **Canada & Mexico could avoid tariffs if they “improve border security” and crack down on fentanyl trafficking**. This suggests Trump is **negotiating in multiple arenas at once**, using economic pressure to force compliance on broader policy goals.

The problem? **Markets hate uncertainty**, and businesses can’t plan if policy keeps shifting based on unrelated factors. While some U.S. industries benefit, long-term uncertainty could hurt investment, expansion, and consumer confidence.",0,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jfidz3/a_deeper_dive_on_trumps_tariffs_and_market/

2025-03-19 10:00:16,Tesla,TSLA,Tesla gets first in a series of permits it needs to run robotaxis in California,"SAN FRANCISCO, March 18 (Reuters) - Tesla [(TSLA.O),](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/TSLA.O) on Tuesday received the first in a series of approvals from California required for the electric car maker to eventually launch a promised robotaxi service in the state, according to a state regulator.The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) said it approved Tesla's application for a [transportation charter-party carrier permit](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-seeking-approval-offer-ride-hailing-services-california-bloomberg-news-2025-02-27/) (TCP), a license typically associated with chauffeur-operated services, allowing the company to own and control a fleet of vehicles and transport employees on pre-arranged trips.

The permit is a prerequisite for applying to operate an autonomous ride-hailing service in California, but a CPUC spokesperson said the current permit ""does not authorize them to provide rides"" in autonomous vehicles, and does not allow Tesla to operate a ride-hailing service to the public.With sales growth slowing, Tesla CEO [Elon Musk](https://www.reuters.com/business/elon-musk/) pivoted his focus last year to rolling out robotaxis and has promised driverless ride-hailing services to the public in California and Texas this year. In October, Tesla revealed the [Cybercab](https://www.reuters.com/technology/teslas-musk-unveil-robotaxis-amid-fanfare-skepticism-2024-10-10/), a robotaxi concept that had no steering wheel or control pedals.Tesla had applied for the TCP permit in November 2024, the regulator said in an email, adding that the company had not applied for the other permits yet.Tesla would also need permits from the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and CPUC in order to operate a fully autonomous robotaxi service that charges customers.Tesla currently only has a DMV permit to test autonomous vehicles with a safety driver.A DMV spokesperson said on Tuesday that Tesla has not applied for any additional permits from the agency, which would be required to move forward with a CPUC application for driverless taxis.Tesla did not respond to requests for comments on the permit and details on the other applications.

2025-03-19 05:55:08,Tesla,TSLA,Trump’s Trade War 2.0: The Stocks I’m Watching,"With Trump back in office and tariffs returning in full force, I’ve been analyzing what this means for U.S. equities. His latest moves—25% steel and aluminum tariffs, expanded levies on Chinese imports, and a tariff-heavy negotiation strategy—echo his first term but with even **stronger measures**.



While 2018-2020 gave us some clues, the market setup in 2025 is **different**:

• **Higher inflation & rates:** Tariffs add inflationary pressure, making the Fed’s job harder.

• **China’s response will change:** Unlike in 2018, China now **dominates EV battery production** and **controls rare earth supply chains**—this could hurt U.S. tech more than before.

• **Supply chain resilience is mixed:** Companies have talked about reshoring for years, but it’s still expensive and slow.

Given these factors, here’s how I’m positioning:

**Likely Winners:**

1. **Steel & Aluminum (NUE, STLD, CLF)** – Tariffs give them pricing power, though cost inflation is a risk.

2. **Defense & Cybersecurity (LMT, PLTR, CRWD)** – “America First” likely means **higher defense budgets**.

3. **Regional Banks (JPM, BAC, GS)** – If deregulation follows, these should gain.

4. **Domestic Infrastructure (CAT, DE, OSK)** – If tariffs hurt foreign suppliers, U.S. construction demand rises.



**Likely Losers:**

1. **Tech Giants (AAPL, NVDA, QCOM, INTC)** – Heavy China exposure = supply chain and revenue risks.

2. **Consumer Goods (NKE, WMT, DG)** – Imports get pricier, and passing costs to lower-income customers is tough.

3. **Auto & Industrial (TSLA, GM, F, MMM)** – Higher input costs + China retaliation = pain.

4. **Agri Exporters (ADM, TSN, BG)** – If China targets U.S. farm products again, these get hit.



**What I’m watching:**

📌 Will China retaliate with rare earth metal export bans? (Impacts TSLA, NVDA, QCOM)

📌 Do inflation expectations rise, pushing Fed policy hawkish? (Bad for rate-sensitive stocks)

📌 Does Trump backtrack on any tariffs? (A la 2019)

📌 Will domestic manufacturing gains **outweigh** supply chain disruptions?

I’d love to hear counterpoints. Which stocks do you think will **outperform or underperform** in Trump’s Trade War 2.0?",256,187,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jeqaup/trumps_trade_war_20_the_stocks_im_watching/

[**XPEV (XPeng)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=XPEV&p=d) \- XPEV reported earnings with revenue of $2.01B, a 20% increase year-over-year, and a 52.1% increase in vehicle deliveries compared to the previous year. Overall, another sign the EV market in China will dominate. Despite being unprofitable, they are reaching more cars sold and are expanding for growth (something that no EV company in the US has managed to do **at scale** except for TSLA). The EV market in China is obviously more competitive than in the US so they're not out of the woods yet for the long term.

2025-03-18 07:49:00,Tesla,TSLA,Unpopular opinion - TSLA still have a lot of cards,"TSLA has dipped into robotics and automated vehicles, if they nailed that and like spaceX got some defence contracts for battle drones, they are trying to get into GM / Lockheed war industries. 

And they could pull resources from Space X for aerial or engine techs.  

Funny that all war machines companies don’t get the scrutiny and those companies sold stuffs to anyone especially on both sides sometime. US is a war driven country, I think everyone could understands that, even in Democratic Obama / Biden era.

2025-03-15 19:35:24,Tesla,TSLA,Tesla stock declines could cost Elon Musk something important,"Snippet from this article:”After a slight rebound earlier this week, Tesla's TSLA stock is back to falling, keeping with its recent performance. Even U.S. President Donald Trump's purchase of one hasn’t done much to spark real momentum for the electric vehicle (EV) leader.
After enjoying significant growth throughout the final months of 2024 and through early 2025, TSLA has lost its previous momentum and isn’t showing signs of a rebound. As reports of declining sales and shifting consumer sentiment continue to trend, it's hard to ignore the company’s questionable outlook.

Link: https://www.thestreet.com/technology/tesla-stock-declines-could-cost-elon-musk-something-important

Many of these problems can be traced to CEO Elon Musk, who is preoccupied with his new responsibilities at the Department of Government Efficiency. His absence at Tesla’s manufacturing facilities is being felt as share prices continue to trend downward.
Musk has lost a lot of money as TSLA stock falls, but he could end up losing something else.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk may be in for a difficult decision if TSLA stock keeps declining. 

Musk’s intertwined business empire could be in trouble 
Tesla may be the company for which Musk is best known, but his assets include several other prominent tech names, including SpaceX and X (formerly Twitter). This wide array of responsibilities concerned investors long before he accepted his new position at DOGE.
Now that he has this new position, Musk is spending even less time running his companies, and things haven’t been going well for any of them. While Tesla stock fell last week, a SpaceX rocket exploded during a test flight, and a cyberattack took X down, although users regained access fairly quickly.

Tesla Bull sounds the alarm on Elon Musk’s leadership

This week, reports surfaced that TSLA stock’s poor performance has resulted in significant losses for Musk. On Monday, March 10, he lost roughly $4.7 billion for every $10 the stock price declined, amounting to a total loss of $18.8 billion.

https://moneycheck.com/tesla-tsla-stock-trumps-purchase-fails-to-sustain-rally/

Tesla’s stock price continues to show volatility in early March trading, falling 0.9% in premarket activity after two days of gains. This follows Monday’s steep 15.4% drop that marked the company’s worst trading day in nearly five years.

The electric vehicle maker saw its shares rebound 7.6% on Wednesday and 3.8% on Tuesday. These gains came after President Donald Trump’s public commitment to purchase a Tesla Model S during a White House event with CEO Elon Musk.

Saw these move mainly due to recession fears and the entire market panicking, MASSIVE move yesterday.

Yesterday, mainly traded TSLA on the overnight exchanges. It had the largest move and got down to around $212. Overall a lot of negative sentiment ranging from boycotts and Elon controversies. Not too interested in trading TSLA today again.  I'm interested in NVDA if we break below 100 but again I think that we'll mainly see a small bounce today rather than breaking new lows. As for RDDT, we're 50% down from highs! Interesting swing candidate but will see how today goes. To me these are the standout stocks yesterday to trade due to recession fears. I don't really see a way out for TSLA regarding the boycotts. We've also seen a decently large move in the VIX (VXX) and we're close to above 60- I'm interested in shorting if we're above $60 but doubt we'll hit that today.

[**ASAN (Asana)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASAN&p=d)

CEO/co-founder, Dustin Moskovitz announced retirement. The company reported Q4 revenues of $188.3M, a 10% YoY increase, and issued a revenue outlook for fiscal 2026 below expectations (resulting in the drop).

That drop was close to 25%, mainly because Dustin owns close to 54% of the company, which signals a LOT of uncertainty and lack of faith in the company. Overall outlook is decently disappointing, and I'm mainly interested in it if we break $11.50 and very interested in buying $10.

**Ticker:** [**AAL (American Airlines)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAL&p=d)

AAL projected a higher-than-expected Q1 loss and revised its revenue outlook downward, attributing the weaker forecast to softness in the domestic leisure segment. This is probably amplified by fears of flying, mainly due to people being terrified of all the plane accidents that have happened in 2025. Recession fears also lead to people cutting their vacations/discretionary spending and saving money, so things may get worse. Overall we're seeing a slight recovery in the premarket but still watching to see how this trades.

2025-03-10 14:16:06,Tesla,TSLA,Why the 2025 Bear Market is the real deal & only just getting started,"When it comes to recent major market corrections, the largest drops have coincided with the loosening of interest rates. There have been market corrections outside of these periods, however, those events are significantly lesser in scope compared to the current analog situations of 2000, 2008, and 2020. 

The Fed Funds rate was held at 6.5% from June 2000 to December 2000. It was 5.25 from July of 2006 to July of 2007. It was 2.4 between January of 2019 and July of 2019. 

As the Fed began cutting rates, in each situation, the market began to decline. However, it was during these declines that illiquidity events took place, causing major panic, and subsequent cratering of markets. 

The 1-point decline in interest rates from peak coincides with February 2001, December 2007, and November of 2019. Each respective recession officially began in March of 2001, December of 2007, and February 2020. 

We hit 1-point below peak in January. There is a strong possibility we are ALREADY in recession, however, genius economists will only tell us this in a year or two. 

In any case, each of these recessions coincided with feat contagion and general panic. Each of these events also bottomed after major catastrophes - in 2000 it was 9/11 and Enron, in 2008 it was Lehman + subprime crisis, in 2019 it was.... that horrible thing that we no longer talk about. 

We are already in the fear stage of the market. 2000's panic was a general meltdown PRIOR to the crises that later unfolded. However, it was those crises that marked its bottom. 2008 and 2020's craterings occurred simultaneous to their crises although stocks did drift down prior to 2008 as well. 

This begs the question: what is the crisis that may or may not occur with the cyclical correction that happens as the Fed cuts rates EVERY cycle? Will it be a true black swan no-one saw coming (9/11) or will it be something like Enron, Lehman, or COVID, where some DID see what was coming ahead of the general panic?

Could TSLA be the Enron of the 2025 bust? It is seeming more and more plausible with each passing day. In any case, the bottom of the market in each of the aforementioned cases occurred simultaneous to the Fed funds rate hitting 0 (or almost 0 in 2003). I expect shelter contribution to CPI to vanish in the next few reports + unemployment to rise significantly, this could give the Fed leeway to put rates back to 0 as soon as Q3-Q4 2025. In both 2009 and 2020 the Fed rate hit 0 when annualized CPI did the same (in March), and March of both years also coincided with their respective market bottoms. 

TLDR; we are far from the bottom, which should occur when Fed Funds hit 0, buy when that happens but before that point, gird your loins.",974,342,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j7zm8c/why_the_2025_bear_market_is_the_real_deal_only/

Musk, as he has been doing for years, makes the stock volatile and swinging with his antics.

Fundamentally TSLA would have to go to something like $100 if you view it purely from a valuation point. But obviously pure valuation doesn't factor in to this stock; there will always be speculation, hype, and hope for new technology disruptions baked in.

2025-03-09 23:35:58,Tesla,TSLA,TSLA being investigated by Transport Canada for cooking their books in Canada to snag EV rebates without selling cars.,"The article notes that **four Tesla dealerships claimed to have sold 8,653 Teslas in 3 days.** Assuming each dealership opens from 9AM-5PM, that's **90 cars sold per hour per dealership**. Worth noting that Canada's EV rebate program was set to shut down, interesting how Tesla found 8,600 sales in 3 days before it did...

Ironic that Musk, who has recently repeatedly said that people who rely on government payments are leeches and that Canada is not a real country, is now accused of trying to leech off of Canadian taxpayer-funded EV rebates himself to the tune of $43M.

I guess that's one way to maintain revenue while sales drop 90%!

Note: investigation is ongoing and there has been no confirmation of official wrongdoing yet.

Edit: Since this post got more attention then I expected. Yes I posted this Sunday and TSLA is currently down 13% today. However I do not think this is causing the drop, and rather it’s an overall market pull back from trade wars and from Europe sales declines.

The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

Today is mostly related to Trump's speech yesterday. Secretary Lutnick announced yesterday ""Tariffs compromise announcement will likely come tomorrow"", so will be on the lookout for that.

News: [Trump Hails Tariffs as US Economy Barrels Into Trade Wars](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-05/trump-to-tout-tariffs-unveil-energy-mineral-projects-in-speech)

**Catalyst:** Trump has called for an end to the CHIPS Act Subsidy Program (instead preferring tariffs).

**Technicals:** Short biased. Obviously this takes away a lot of investment in semis companies. Extremely negative catalyst but unlikely it will get repealed due to how much bipartisan support it had.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The CHIPS and Science Act gave $280B in new funding to boost domestic research/manufacturing of semis in the US, and also aimed to strengthen supply chain resilience against China and widely considered to be a success because it spurred the development/dominance in the semis sector in America.

**Risks:** If this gets repealed, we're likely going to see a pretty large pullback in the semis. Obviously this is dependent on what the tariffs Trump touts will do as well. [I wrote a little more about my take on a different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j437g9/trump_calls_for_end_to_52_billion_chips_act/) but overall more of the same (I think it's a terrible idea).

**Catalyst:** The Trump administration is considering granting relief from the recently imposed 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports for products that comply with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).

**Technicals:** We've seen all three stocks (GM especially) make gains due to this announcement, will watch at open for volume.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The automotive industry in US/Canada/Mexico involves the most economic/manufacturing cooperation in the USMCA, they're the most obvious beneficiaries of this potential catalyst.

**Risks:** If they don't actually give relief, then will likely pullback- cars are one of the most affected products of tariffs and pretty much every car company has spoken about tariffs on their earnings calls.

**Catalyst:** Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has indicated that Trump plans to grant the main biggest CC a ""unique status"" within the Bitcoin reserve strategy, which will be unveiled at the White House Crypto Summit on Friday.

**Technicals:** We've seen the underlying spike close to 8-9% since yesterday, watching $90K level. Interested to see how we go prior to the actual summit.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Obviously an extremely bullish catalyst, we've bounced strongly off the $80K level recently. I usually trade through the ETFs as needed, and HOOD/Coinbase serve as proxies in case the ETFs aren't liquid or have already moved.

**Risks:** Worth waiting for the catalyst and watching the CC Summit on Friday. I personally see this more of a ""buy on hype"" kind of catalyst, unless there's an announcement of something extremely bullish I'm not sure how much more this will move the needle.

**Ticker:** [**HII (Huntington Ingalls Industries)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HII&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Trump has announced initiatives aimed at strengthening the U.S. shipbuilding industry to counter China's dominance, spoke about the creation of a White House Office of Shipbuilding and the introduction of special tax incentives.

**Technicals:** None that I'm particularly interested in, this is a longer-term play.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** China produces over half of the world's merchant vessels, this is more of a play to reduce reliance on foreign-shipping.

**Risks:** There's a chance that this will never happen, Trump tried to create a ""Cybersecurity Department"" in his first term but that was never formally created and we kept those duties spread out between the FBI/DHS/NSA. But we also have the Space Force so... stay tuned.

>It will require outstanding execution, but I think more like 1000% gain for Tesla in 5 years is possible.

Tariffs are here.

News: [Trump Tariffs China, Canada, Mexico](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2025-03-04/trump-tariffs-china-canada-mexico)

**Ticker:** [**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Reports preliminary February China deliveries of 30,688 cars, down close to 50% from last year.

**Technicals:** Overall a brutal delivery report. TSLA has been on a slide since post-election highs and frankly shows no real sign of recovery. Looking for a small bounce in this stock but I don't think there is much potential for long-term recovery.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** TSLA's EV sales have been declining in China mainly due to BYD, which are considered to make better cars for far cheaper outside the US. The US has a 100% EV tariff for non-US made EV vehicles.

**Risks:** BYD has been eating TSLA's lunch outside of the US. I truly don't see TSLA retaining dominance as the EV of choice outside the US. 

**Ticker:** [**OKTA (Okta)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=OKTA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Okta beat earnings expectations with EPS of $.78 vs $.74,gave guidance that supports EPS of $3.20 vs $2.93. (Also note that CRWD reports today but are not direct competitors)

**Technicals:** Watching $100 level.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Cybersecurity (more specifically IAM) grows yearly mainly due to RPO and cRPO (remaining performance obligations). This is subscription backlog expected to be recognized over the next 12 months.

**Risks:** Market saturation/pricing concerns from competitors.

**Ticker:** [**NVDA (Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Nvidia is front and center as the stock most affected by tariff concerns.

**Technicals:** Watching $110 level. Note that this is the lowest it's been since September 2024. We have millions of shares come in in the first 2 minutes of the open so watch for that.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Not much to speak of that hasn't been said before, but NVDA is heavily affected by tariffs and the CHIPS Act, with additional scrutiny that it is somehow bypassing export controls and having their chips go into China.

**Risks:** MORE trade disputes, more potential export restrictions, (Trump has cited he wants to strengthen export controls for NVDA).

**Catalyst:** China has imposed 15% retaliatory tariffs on select U.S. goods.

**Technicals:** $130 level. Most interesting level I'm watching today.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Tariffs, stimulus from the Chinese government, China has been spending for increased consumer confidence. 

**Risks:** Even greater tariffs, the cash cannon that China is using dies down, less spending by Chinese consumers, etc.

**NVDA earnings today, will likely decide the fate of the immediate market. It reports at 4:20 ET today!**

News: [China Plans To Start Bank Capital Hike With At Least 55 Billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-26/china-plans-to-start-bank-capital-hike-with-at-least-55-billion)

**Catalyst:** Some catalysts today: Deepseek cuts API pricing by 75%, NVDA is reporting earnings, ChatGPT is doing a limited rollout of ChatGPT 4.5, META considering $200B AI data center.

NVDA reporting earnings is the main catalyst today and decides the immediate direction of the market.

**Technicals:** Mainly interested in seeing if NVDA misses revenue (unlikely) or if they say anything significant due to new export controls which I talked about yesterday (strengthening of CHIPS Act export controls to China).

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** NVDA leads in semis design, is a multi-billion dollar company, etc.

**Risks:** I'm currently positioned defensively (sold calls against my position since I have a decent cost basis from back when DeepSeek news released, so overall will just sit on hands and get out of my position if the earnings are bad).

**Ticker:** [**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** (Old news) New report shows demand is falling in Europe, with sales dropping a precipitous 45% in January.

**Technicals:** Massive selloff since post-election highs- $300 was a significant level I was watching at the time and we exploded past that, so interested to see if we're able to hold above it.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** BYD is a major competitor to TSLA and will likely overtake them in the future, and Musk's political actions are seen as controversial in Europe.

**Risks:** Musk.

**Related Tickers:** BYD, and other auto stocks.

**Ticker:** [**COIN (Coinbase)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=COIN&p=d)**/**[**HOOD (Robinhood)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HOOD&p=d)**/**[**MSTR (MicroStrategy)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MSTR&p=d)**/Other CC Stocks**

**Catalyst:** The CC market is experiencing a selloff mainly due to proposed tariffs and the hack at Bybit, resulting in the loss of \~$1.5 billion.

**Technicals:** Not too interested in playing this long- still watching to see how we perform but the sell off has continued, waiting for a larger move still.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Hacks increase fear of storing on centralized exchanges (like Coinbase), proposed tariffs affecting digital assets can lead to market volatility. Interestingly enough, ByBit was (theorized) to be hacked by North Korea.

**Catalyst:** China plans to inject at least $55 billion into its largest banks in the coming months as part of a broader stimulus package, Yuan printer go brrrrr. This move is intended to supplement the core Tier 1 capital of China’s six largest state-owned banks. This is the first bank recapitalization since the global financial crisis. 10T yuan (\~$1.4T) debt package to support local government financing and economic stability.

**Technicals:** We've seen a decent upmove on a lot of Chinese stocks due to this, we'll see how the market reacts.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** China has been going through a spending crisis, and the government's decision to inject substantial capital into its major banks is a move to strengthen liquidity. This initiative aims to enhance the lending capacity of banks, support local government financing, and stabilize the broader economy. It's a (pre) bailout baby.

**Risks:** This does signal that China sees economic weakness, such as lack of demand due to their real estate sector they've traditionally leaned on for consumer growth/investment. Is this a long term fix? Who knows, but it worked for the US!

**Related Tickers:** JD, BIDU

**Ticker: SMCI**

**Catalyst:** They finally filed an hour before the deadline on the final day! Really cutting it close there lol. The company has faced allegations of accounting irregularities. These allegations, along with a failure to file specific financial forms have been a plague for the past year on the stock price. 

**Technicals:** We've seen a 20% move AH, so worth watching at open to see if we move further. Other than that, watching $50/$55 level. We'll see where it goes but worth noting that we've made a significant move back to pre-delisting threat prices already.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Was at threat of delisting from the NASDAQ but now they're safe baby.

**Risks:** People getting out, or the filing being rejected/advised to resubmit. The latter is a massive catalyst but low probability.

2025-02-26 00:11:08,Tesla,TSLA,What are stocks that will benefit from the Trump chaos?,"If what Elon and Trump are doing now continues to be bad for the markets, what are specific sectors/countries that will benefit? What's a good buy if I'm very negative on the current direction of the US?

Moving money from the US to foreign markets may be smart, but which? And a crash in the US tends to affect the entire world, so while they'd probably be safer, they won't be safe.

I pulled out of the US markets entirely last week before the 4 down days. I just put 1/3 of my portfolio into EUAD which is an ETF of some of the biggest European defense stocks.  I know I'm a few months late on this one. Europe is realizing that it can't count on the US anymore and will have to grow its own defense industry. I'm definitely willing to investigate and invest in smaller defense stocks too. I don't expect it to go nuts, because these are old established companies and their stocks don't move that fast, but I think it's a very safe bet that Europe's defense stocks are going to grow over the next few years.

What are some other examples of trying to adjust to the current situation? Short TSLA? Invest in other EV companies that take some of the post-TSLA hype? What industries/ETFs represent the best bet for the trade the US loses if it starts implementing tariffs again?

Anyway, I vaguely remember the stock market crash of 1987.  I was young but I used to play a stock trading game on my “IBM Compatible” computer which really wasn’t but that is how they sold you computers back then.  It had a ticker that would scroll across the screen and you could buy and sell stocks in made up companies.

No one really knows where the stock market is heading the rest of the year but I could make a pretty good argument we are moving towards stagflation temporarily.  I can see a scenario of a weakening economy with persistent inflation.  So, if the market were to move negative the rest of the year, what are your picks to see the largest downside moves?

My picks:

TSLA - Obvious reasons…its stock prices is built on a dream that is becoming a nightmare
PINS - Low revenue growth outside the U.S, ADU growth slowing down, It is mostly ads now and almost unusable. 25B market came to 3.5B revenue.
SNAP - 11 years in and still can’t make a profit.  

Also, if federal grant money really does decline, and cuts to Medicaid, pick any public health care stock and buy puts.  If they cancel infrastructure contracts, pick most of the shovel companies like Caterpillar and buy puts.  If they cancel the farmer subsidies, buy puts in John Deere.  So many others that are going to be hurt.

So what is your pick for the largest declining stock of 2025 between 2/25 and 12/31?  ",0,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ixcnn1/shall_we_play_a_game_i_love_the_80sand_we_are/

Palantir has been on a tear recently, all hyped up on the defense sector growth but no one is really paying attention to Meta Defense and their entry to the space. Last year Meta opened up its AI models to defense agencies and contractors. This is huge for them to get this level of clearance and i think this will will put them in direct competition with Palantir. Im not sure how they build out this branch of Meta, Im calling it Meta Defense but they fired all their woke people and are starting to re-shape the company.

Yes, there is defense spending cuts but its all on waste and overcharged contracts not on things that actually matter for the dept of defense. During the inauguration Zuckerberg was in the front row, Hegseth was somewhere in the back. Just an observation.

Everyone is familiar with their social media business so there isnt a whole lot to talk about there. AI keeps improving, More growth from Reels, Threads, Facebook. Their LLM is impressive and arguably one of the best, putting them up there with OpenAI.

With all there user data they have Meta Analytics could be another source of revenue.

They are sitting on a goldmine with Facebook market place. i get they have ads but i feel they could do more.  Im not sure Zuckerberg realized what he has there but this business if monetized right could be HUGE.

2025-02-18 20:49:47,Tesla,TSLA,Portfolio Advice - 30yo and married,"Hey everyone, love this sub. I been working on rebalancing my portfolio and would love some thoughts - I primarily trimmed down my single stock picks into ETFs. 

I’m 30 and my wife is 27 - we have a NW of about 800K across brokerage and retirement accounts. 

Our breakdown is as follows across that 800K:

- TSLA: 100K (12.5%) 
- SOFI: 48K (6%)
- PLTR: 35K (4.3%)
- PYPL: 16K (2%)

- Cash + Gold: 30K

I recently trimmed down about half of both my TSLA and PLTR positions, and moved them into VOO/VGT. Feeling a lot better/safer with that decision, but would love some thoughts. I know TSLA is pretty hated on Reddit, but I do believe in their FSD and roadmap for the next few years.

2025-02-15 15:30:23,Tesla,TSLA,How Musk is using TSLA as a piggy bank,"Everyone knows it is a meme stock. By definition it would crash at some point. The trick is to make money while not ending up being the bag holder when it crashes.

But the stock won’t crash unless Musk starts selling. And he knows it too. So he is using the meme stock and meme coins as collateral to invest in real companies that actually have some realistic valuation. 

Musk sold $8.5 billion in Tesla shares to buy Twitter. The stock went down. He basically converted the meme stock to a real company. The banks underwrote that investment suffered losses but he used Twitter to buy the presidency. The banks lost money but gained favors like less regulations instead. Everyone is happy.

He contracts out TSLA stuff to his private companies like xAi.  XAi and Optimus have huge conflicts of interest. Both of them need the best AI talents. My guess is Optimus will end up being the hardware side of the business(nuts and bolts assembly) while the software and IPs will belong to XAi. And for every robot sold, there will be a license paid to XAi. If the board removes Musk, the licensing fee will go up making TSLA side of the business virtually worthless.

I am pretty sure the big investment banks know these things but they are given investment opportunities in his private businesses in exchange for their silence and their inflated analyst valuations. And they don’t want to shoot themselves in the foot having lent him huge sums of money.

People say Musk won’t let TSLA down because most of his wealth is tied to it. At this point he is milking TSLA for what it is worth. He is borrowing against inflated meme stock prices to buy real companies that are private. He is hedging against the inevitable TSLA crash. His lenders are going with the Ponzi scheme to mitigate the risk to their massive investment. Having borrowed heavily against TSLA shares Musk has no incentive to work for TSLA anymore.

If I have sizable TSLA holdings I would be nervously watching his latest  and totally random OpenAI cash offer of $98 billion or a potential tik tok bid. That means the stock will crater again if he sells stock, he may not care because by now he knows the game is up. Maybe it is triggered by BYD offering free FSD on 20k cars. And this time there might be no coming back. He might offer you first dibs on SpaceX ipo for holding worthless TSLA shares but it sure won’t be cheap.

Disclosure: I don’t have any positions on TSLA at this point.

I’m no Tesla expert, and I’m sure plenty of people know way more about the company than I do, but I wanted to throw out some thoughts and see what you all think.



Right now, TSLA is sitting around $330 a share, up 75% YOY. But honestly, I see some major red flags:



📉 Shrinking Profit Margins – Tesla’s margins have been steadily declining for years. Not a great trend.



🏴‍☠️ Musk’s PR Nightmare – Elon literally gave a “Sieg Heil” on live TV. Now, a huge chunk of the world sees him (and by extension, Tesla) as a Nazi. That’s… not exactly great for brand reputation.



🚗 Cybertruck is a Mess – Poor build quality, tons of issues, and at this point, it’s basically a meme.



🌍 New Political & Tariff Risks – Tesla is vulnerable to steel and aluminum tariffs, an anti-EV U.S. President, and a California governor who hates Musk and might pull state EV rebates.



⚡ Serious Competition is Catching Up – Tesla isn’t the undisputed EV/FSD leader anymore. Other companies are matching—or surpassing—them in innovation.



🚦 FSD is Overhyped – Despite all the robotaxi talk, Tesla’s self-driving tech is still only Level 2-3. Meanwhile, other companies already have Level 4 robotaxis on the road.



🔋 Rising Costs = Profit Squeeze – Raw material costs are going up, and Trump’s tariffs on China-made batteries could make things even worse.



🤖 Tesla is Struggling to Attract Top AI Talent – Even before Musk’s latest antics, nearly all top AI researchers and recent ML PhD graduates from the top schools were choosing OpenAI, Anthropic, or GAMMA (Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Apple) over Tesla or xAI. Now? Even fewer want to work there, which could hurt Tesla’s AI progress.



🔵 Losing Left-Leaning Consumers – Left-leaning buyers are way more likely to buy EVs than right-leaning ones. And almost every left-leaning consumer has grown to despise Musk, leading them to choose non-Tesla EVs instead.



Tesla used to be the Nvidia of EVs—they were miles ahead of everyone else. But that’s just not the case anymore. There are more non-Tesla EV options every year, and in terms of FSD, several companies already have a better product and better talent. So, to me, a $1.1 trillion valuation feels ridiculous.

I've also heard reports of Teslas being vandalized, with anti-Musk slogans carved into them.

Moreover, last quarter was seen by the market as disappointing, if not delusional, adding a financial component to the concerns. This could be a reason to adopt a bearish outlook on the stock.

2025-02-11 16:21:54,Tesla,TSLA,ELI5: what is risk to hold TSLQ for several months?,"Edit:  thanks for replies.  I think I understand better now, the concept of ""decay"" (due to volatility, rebalancing etc) and how an inverse ETF can go down even when the stock it's tracking also goes down.

New question:  let's say I'm willing to make a ""bet"" that TSLA goes down in the next 6-12mo... what is the simplest way for me to make that bet?  Do I really have to get into margin accts and short selling?  Basically I'd like to ""mirror"" TSLA for next 12mo.  Is there a simple way to do that or not really?

\---

I'm new to inverse ETFs and have a small position in TSLQ.  I do know that several 'warnings' say that these style investments are meant for intraday, but since it is an ETF I don't understand the risk of holding for weeks or months.  (apart from the obvious, if the tracking stock goes up)  So here's my question, if the hypothesis comes true (that TSLA goes down over next 6mo) what is the risk to just hold TSLQ ETF for that period?

Another way to ask, is there something else going on with the 'tracking' where over longer periods of time the ETF won't track to certain kinds of losses (eg; during after hours or something else...)?  Is it possible that TSLA goes down over a period of time but somehow TSLQ doesn't gain?

Amazon down 4% after releasing earnings recently. AWS results came in lower than expected & guidance for next quarter's revenue & profit came up short

Curious what others go from here. For some long-term investors, it's a dip for a buying opportunity. Some might stay away given limited upside with DeepSeek, high Capex, and softer revenue growth.

**Ticker:** [**F (Ford Motor Company)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=F&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Ford Motor Company reports .39 vs .34 expected, revenue of $48.2 vs 43.6B expected. Announces that profit could fall by $2B or more due to tariffs and lower EV demand.

**Technicals:** Pretty much broke the $10 level it's been trading around since August, watching to see if it'll sell off more by the open. Highly/infinitely liquid.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The entire automotive industry is challenged by tariffs. F guided lower for 2025.

**Risks:** Obviously these are one of the bigger movers from Mexico tariffs (most cars are assembled in Mexico then shipped to the US).

**Related Tickers:** GM, TSLA, STLA.

**Offhand Comments:** Ford's outlook reflects the broader industry's apprehension about geopolitical factors affecting operations and profitability. Interesting to see how other car companies react to earnings as well.

**Ticker:** [**ARM (Arm Holdings)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ARM&p=d)

**Catalyst:** ARM reported EPS of $0.39 vs. $0.34 expected. Revenue of $983 million vs. $959M expected. Buoyed by Deepseek ban news, most likely as well.

**Technicals:** Was down roughly 8% after earnings, but seems to be somewhat recovering after Deepseek news.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Semiconductor sector is experiencing heightened demand, especially after PLTR's comments that the AI train will never stop. We're seeing growth in data center applications, the main driver of semis purchases.

**Risks:** Despite strong performance, Arm's lowered full-year revenue forecast has led to a 6% drop in its shares.

**Related Tickers:** NVDA, AMD, INTC.

**Ticker:** [**RBLX (Roblox Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RBLX&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Roblox Corporation reported earnings with an EPS of -$0.33 vs. -$0.46 expected. Revenue of $988.2M vs. $967.2M expected.

**Technicals:** $50 is the clear level here, note that earnings were released premarket rather than aftermarket yesterday. Seems to be a massive overreaction selloff (but has recovered somewhat).

**Risks:** IIRC Roblox isn't profitable yet- they're focusing on growth/revenue over profits, but most of their costs are outside their control (platform fees like the Apple store, developers, infrastructure for trust/safety for minors).

**Related Tickers:** EA, TTWO.

**Ticker:** [**NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** DeepSeek, a Chinese AI start-up, has temporarily suspended its API service top-ups due to server resource constraints. Additionally, U.S. lawmakers plan to introduce a bill to ban DeepSeek's chatbot application from government-owned devices over data security concerns.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The AI industry is under increased scrutiny regarding data security and geopolitical tensions but that's grown more laissez-faire under Trump. DeepSeek's service suspension and potential U.S. government ban helps American chip makers and NVDA especially, due to their continued dominance.

**Risks:** Deepseek getting banned will likely lead to greater reliance on American AI chatbots, spurring growth in American semis manufacturers.

**Related Tickers:** AMD, INTC, QCOM.

**Offhand Comments:** (I am currently long).

**Ticker:** [**SWKS (Skyworks Solutions)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SWKS&p=d)

**Catalyst:** EPS of $1.60 vs. $1.57 expected. Revenue of $1.07B vs 1.07B expected. Reports $2B stock buyback plan.

**Technicals:** Watching the $60 level, we've had a brutal fall from $90->$60. If we get closer I'm interested in some small bounce depending on volume/size of the move.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** SWKS supplies some of the chips for Apple's iPhone, and their iPhone sales haven't done too well recently- thus this has a knock-on effect by affecting SWKS's sales.

**Risks:** SWKS projected a revenue decline for the mobile segment and issued a lower profit forecast. They stated they anticipated a ""mid-to-high teens decline in mobile.""

**Offhand Comments: A lot of the firms that manufacture parts for the iPhone are linked in performance, especially if the iPhone is the main source of their sales- would be interesting to formulate some trading ideas from that.**

2025-02-04 03:09:52,Tesla,TSLA,Tesla’s Valuation: Speculation or Real Growth? My DCF Insights,"I did a quick and dirty DCF valuation for TSLA, and here’s what I found. I don’t own TSLA individually; I only have exposure through the S&P. However, with recent events, I’ve been wondering why people hold TSLA.

My typical process when looking into a company starts with a DCF to gauge approximately what the company should currently be valued at. I know, I know, it’s not perfect, but it’s a way to get started.

For TSLA, I averaged the last three years of free cash flow (FCF) at about $5.1 billion. I used a 5% FCF growth rate and a terminal growth rate of 3%, along with a discount rate of 12%. All these estimates are generous for a few reasons: the share count is increasing, FCF has declined over the past three years, and the risk is high.

With these assumptions, I came up with a value of $26.24, which is only 6.85% of the current price. This means that 93% of the value is based on future growth and speculation.

Now, many people assume that Tesla will revolutionize humanoid robots and self-driving cars, so I took a more optimistic approach to the DCF. I used a 20% FCF growth rate and a terminal growth of 7%, which is probably unrealistic. Using the same discount rate, I arrived at a value of $52.62. This represents 13.74% of the current value, meaning 86.26% is based on even more future growth and potential.

With all that said, it’s hard for me to understand what people see in this company. Or am I just thinking the wrong way, and it has nothing to do with making money?

Congrats to all the long-term holders who have made a killing! I’d love to hear your thoughts on this.",12,85,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ih835v/teslas_valuation_speculation_or_real_growth_my/

2025-01-30 23:23:09,Tesla,TSLA,"Trump to Hit Canada, Mexico With 25% Tariffs on Saturday","* President says he is still weighing 10% tariffs on China
* Canada, Mexico tariffs threaten to upend auto, energy sectors

**Thoughts:** We will literally see a decision from Trump tonight regarding whether or not oil will be exempted from the tariffs, otherwise the stocks I'm watching on the OVERNIGHT exchange are F/GM/TM and TSLA/LCID (stands to lose rather than gain if oil is exempted) in addition to all the oil stocks that are standard (OIL, BP, XOM, etc). We might also see some volatility tomorrow at the open, VIX has already spiked but went back to preannouncement levels.

~~EDIT: TARIFFS ARE DELAYED UNTIL MARCH 1ST~~

# [EDIT 2: ANNOUNCEMENT OF TARIFF DELAY HAS BEEN DEBUNKED, STILL CONTINUING ON SATURDAY ACCORDING TO WH PRESS SECRETARY ](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/north-america-braces-new-trump-tariffs-saturday-deadline-nears-2025-01-31/)

>President Donald Trump President Donald Trump said he would follow through on his threat to impose 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico on Feb. 1, citing the flow of fentanyl and large trade deficits as among the reasons for his decision.

>“We’ll be announcing the tariffs on Canada and Mexico for a number of reasons,” Trump told reporters Thursday in the Oval Office as he signed executive actions in response to a deadly airplane collision.

>“Number one is the people that have poured into our country so horribly and so much. Number two are the drugs, fentanyl and everything else that have come into the country. Number three are the massive subsidies that we’re giving to Canada and to Mexico in the form of deficits,” he said.

>West Texas Intermediate oil futures climbed above $73 a barrel following the comments. The US dollar wiped out an earlier loss to touch the day’s high after the remarks, while the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso both plunged. US Treasuries pared their gains.

>Trump indicated the 25% rate could represent a floor, saying that the tariff levels “may or may not rise with time.”

>But the US president did suggest he was still considering if one significant import — oil — would be exempted. Trump said would be making a determination as soon as Thursday evening, basing his decision upon the price of oil.

>“We don’t need the products that they have. We have all the oil that you need. We have all the trees you need,” Trump added, referring to major imports from Canada.

>Trump’s move was closely anticipated by markets as well as global business and political leaders who have scrutinized his words and actions for any indication on whether the US president would deliver on his levy threats or use them as the starting point for negotiations on trade.

>Trump in recent days threatened and then pulled back on tariffs against Colombia in a dispute over deportations of undocumented migrants, leading some to speculate that he was using trade levies merely as leverage to seek policy concessions.

>Trump also indicated that he would proceed with tariffs on China. He didn’t specify the levy, though he’s previously said it would be 10%. Trump has said Beijing failed to follow through on promises to prevent fentanyl and the chemicals used to make the deadly drugs from flowing into the US.

>“With China, I’m also thinking about something because they’re sending fentanyl into our country, and because of that, they’re causing us hundreds of thousands of deaths,” Trump said Thursday. “So China is going to end up paying a tariff also for that, and we’re in the process of doing that.”

>Trump has ordered his administration to investigate whether China complied with a trade deal struck during his first term, setting the stage for tariffs against the world’s second largest economy.

>Following through on tariffs against Canada and Mexico, who are US neighbors, major trading partners, and export markets, threatens to have dramatic economic consequences, rattle markets and potentially launch a trade war by undermining protections from a three-nation free trade agreement.

>Both countries have pledged to respond to any trade levies, including with retaliatory tariffs, even as their leaders sought to assure the US they were addressing border concerns in a bid to defuse the conflict.

>“If these tariffs go into effect, Canada will respond,” Canadian Ambassador to the US Kirsten Hillman said Thursday. “This is not something that we want to do. We do not want to get into a tariff-back-and-forth with the United States. It’s not good for Canada, Canadians and Canadian workers and it’s not good for the United States, Americans and American workers.”

>Hillman said that Canada has responded to Trump’s concerns about the border by clamping down and announcing new security measures, including added drones and helicopters.

>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visited Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort even before the president was inaugurated in a bid to ease tensions between their nations, and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum spoke to Trump to try to avert the levies.

>In the first 11 months of 2024, US trade with Canada totaled $699 billion and $776 billion with Mexico. And the magnitude of tariffs Trump will enact could have stark impacts on particular industries, such as the auto industry and the energy sector. Shares of US automakers Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co. turned negative on the announcement, erasing earlier gains.

>“President Trump’s tariffs will tax America first,” Matthew Holmes, executive vice president at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, said Thursday. “From higher costs at the pumps, grocery stores and online checkout, tariffs cascade through the economy and end up hurting consumers and businesses on both sides of the border. This is a lose-lose.”

>Trump is also promising sectoral tariffs, such as on pharmaceuticals, semiconductor chips, steel, aluminum and copper, which could apply widely to many countries, including Canada and Mexico.

>The US president is an avowed believer in tariffs, saying they will force a renaissance in domestic manufacturing, though industry groups warn that it will upend supply chains and endanger existing factories by raising costs of source materials.

>He’s hailed tariffs as a source of revenue as lawmakers move to renew and expand expiring tax cuts and approve other credits and benefits the president promised on the campaign trail. Trump wants to reduce the corporate rate to 15% for firms that manufacture goods in the US, compared to the current 21% rate.said he would follow through on his threat to impose 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico on Feb. 1, citing the flow of fentanyl and large trade deficits as among the reasons for his decision.

2025-01-30 14:20:34,Tesla,TSLA,These are the stocks on my watchlist (01/30),"This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed!

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments.

The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

**Today OpenAI may make history. Trying out longer form, more detailed catalyst examinations over the short-form with more tickers.**

**Ticker:** [**META (Meta Inc)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=META&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Reported earnings of $8.02 vs $6.68 expected. Revenue of $48.4B vs $47B,but guided revenue short of consensus and didn't provide FY25 revenue outlook (which triggered the reason for the selloff post-earnings after the close).

Their CAPEX announcement was $60-65B vs $52.4B expected, and stated they expected the single largest driver of expesive growth in 2025 as infrastructure costs due to higher OpEX and depreciation.

Also announced plans to grow META's AI team significantly.

**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** Earnings move the stock on far less volume but the initial selloff after announcement was worth trading- interested in the $700 level today but not much beyond that.

**Context:** Decent earnings but signals that there is more spending on the horizon- likely that the initial brutal selloff to $606 was from algos just reading the initial eye-popping CAPEX number and selling the company.

**Sector Context:**There is a major next-level breakthrough that OpenAI is expected to release today that has agents performing on the same level as PHDs, Altman is meeting today with US government officials. META is the creator of Llama, which is another open source model compared to OpenAI's closed models.

**Risks:** Deepseek has been the main threat involved, with competitors from China using distillation and other AI techniques to be able to train a far cheaper model that brings up the question of why our large tech firms are spending so much on GPUs. (I'm sure this is news to you /s)

**Related Tickers:** FAANG stocks, SNAP, PINS, etc.

Offhand:  Something worth remembering is that there is a $10B undersea cable that spans over 40K km that they plan to build (unknown what the cable is for), more details coming in 2025. Likely some kind of fiber optic cable.

**Ticker:** [**TSLA (Tesla Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Reported earnings of $0.73 vs $0.76 expected. Revenue of $25.71B vs $27.23B expected. Most of this revenue miss came from miss in sale of EVs. 

TSLA announced interesting plans to lower the price of EVs in 2025 but also didn't give specific details regarding the production volume targets (as they have in the past), and also announced that there would be a paid robotaxi service in Austin in June. This puts them in competition with Waymo/UBER. Personally I think the vision-only approach is not viable in the long-run but hey, I'm no self-driving PHD. 

CAPEX was ALSO higher as with META due to spending increases from AI training infra costs and battery production capacity.

**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** I'm mainly interested in the $375/$400 level, not too interested in going long despite the multi-day slide in price.

**Context:** Main reason for TSLA's selloff was the lack of full-year guidance (it gives the subtext that it's too bad to release publically or it's up in the air). Political statements made by Musk may contribute to future issues for TSLA.

**Sector Context:** Revenue shortfall was caused due to lower-than-expected vehicle deliveries/ increased sale incentives, 496K cars vs 507K exp. China's BYD is rapidly catching up, and the (possible) removal of the US EV tax credit may make EV's more expensive

**Risks:** Mainly geopolitical- if the tariffs on EV vehicles imported to the US gets removed, TSLA will face fiercer competition from BYD. Also Elon Musk.

**Related Tickers:** BYD (but mainly trades in China, TSLA isn't as impacted by AI news.)



[**NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation) (in addition to ARM/AMD/SMH/SOXL/semiconductor stocks)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** The reveal of Deepseek has introduced an AI model that rivals existing solutions but was developed at around $6M. However there's a rumor that Deepseek is actually trained on 50K H100 NVDA gpus.

**Yesterday after the close, there was an announcement Trump officials discussing tightening curbs on Nvidia's China sales.**

**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** Overall, there's been a massive selloff since NVDA was $150 at the end of last week. Overall interested again if we hit $116, but low confidence we'll sell off again. 

Currently long.

**Sector Context:** Not much to really say about this beyond NVDA having the most advanced chips that are widespread for training because of the CUDA architecture- most people are doubtful that the TOTAL cost was $6M

US Officials are examining export restrictions but China will likely find a way to bypass them as they have previously.

**Risks:** Mainly geopolitical, again. Obviously it's very difficult to restrict trade to a country that we have no military presence in or surround, and China is economically far more powerful than those we have attempted trade restrictions on in the past.

# [S&P 500 futures rise after Meta Platforms, Tesla report earnings: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/29/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> S&P 500 futures rose Thursday as Wall Street digested recent quarterly results from a slew of megacap tech companies. Investors are coming off a losing session after the Federal Reserve held steady on rates.
*****
> Futures tied to the broad market index added 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.5%. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were fractionally lower.
*****
> Shares of Meta Platforms and Tesla gained 1% and 2%, respectively, while Microsoft shares dipped more than 4% after the companies reported earnings. Meta beat on top and bottom lines, but Microsoft shares faltered after the company’s quarterly revenue forecast disappointed. Tesla shrugged off an earnings and revenue miss. On the other hand, revenue misses from UPS and Caterpillar weighed the indexes down.
*****
> Other “Magnificent Seven” names are set to report in the coming days, with Apple’s results being due for a Thursday release. Amazon will soon follow suit, as the megacap tech company reports next week.
*****
> On Wednesday, all three major averages ended the session lower as a 4% decline in Nvidia weighed on the market. The declines came after the Fed paused its interest rate-cutting campaign, leaving its borrowing rate unchanged in a range between 4.25% and 4.5%. In their post-meeting statement, policymakers noted that inflation remains “somewhat elevated.”
*****
> “The implication is that we’re on hold until the inflation rate goes down, and unfortunately it’s probably not going to go down very much in the several months ahead, so I wouldn’t be looking for rate cuts at the next meeting,” Jeffrey Gundlach, DoubleLine Capital CEO, said Wednesday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.”
*****
> “We have a relatively stable place where we’re standing, and it kind of supports the fact that the market is in a calm position right now, and so is [Jerome] Powell apparently,” he said.
*****
> On the economic data front, the fourth-quarter gross domestic product reading is due on Thursday, and weekly jobless claims are out in the morning. Investors are also looking ahead to Friday’s personal consumption expenditures price index report for December.

2025-01-29 03:21:57,Tesla,TSLA,Apple and SpaceX Link Up to Support Starlink Satellite Network on iPhones,"**Thoughts:** Obviously good for companies that are involved in the sat comm business (but may be bad/neutral for sat comm companies that do not work with AAPL such as GSAT), TMUS, and AAPL. TSLA is also possibly affected because SpaceX trades as a proxy to TSLA news. VZ/T/other phone providers may be affected but the use case is so niche that I won't hold my breath. 

>Apple Inc. has been secretly working with SpaceX and T-Mobile US Inc. to add support for the Starlink network in its latest iPhone software, providing an alternative to the company’s in-house satellite-communication service.

>

>The companies have been testing iPhones with the Starlink service from Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp., according to people with knowledge of the matter. In an under-the-radar move, the smartphone’s latest software update — released Monday — now supports the technology.

>

>The tie-up comes as a surprise: T-Mobile has previously only specified Starlink as an option for Samsung Electronics Co. phones, such as the Z Fold and S24 models. Apple, meanwhile, already provides a Globalstar Inc. offering that lets consumers send texts and contact emergency responders when out of cellular range.

>

>T-Mobile has begun allowing customers to sign up for an early version of the Starlink service, and this week the carrier enabled a small number of iPhones as part of a beta test.

>

>The first users received text messages from T-Mobile saying, “You’re in the T-Mobile Starlink beta. You can now stay connected with texting via satellite from virtually anywhere. To start experiencing coverage beyond, please update to iOS 18.3.” Users in the program have a new toggle switch in their iPhone cellular data settings to manage the satellite feature.

>

>An Apple spokesperson declined to comment, while T-Mobile said that the test will “begin with select optimized smartphones” and that the full launch will “support the vast majority of modern smartphones.” T-Mobile has also opened the beta to some users running Android 15, the latest version of the Google operating system. A representative for SpaceX didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

>

>Ever since Apple teamed up with Globalstar to offer satellite features in 2022, there’s been speculation over whether it might support competing networks. The day after Apple’s 2022 announcement, Musk posted on X that his company has “had some promising conversations with Apple about Starlink connectivity.”

>

>Here’s how it will work: When a T-Mobile iPhone is in an area without cellular connectivity, devices that are part of the Starlink program will first try to pair with SpaceX satellites. Users will also be able to enable texting via the satellite menu for the Globalstar service or contact emergency services through Apple.

>

>The initial version of Starlink is exclusively for texting. But SpaceX and T-Mobile have said that they plan to expand into data connections and voice calls in the future. The program also is only available in the US for now. That contrasts with Apple’s Globalstar service, which works in several countries. SpaceX is looking to expand Starlink to other carriers globally.

>

>There’s another major difference between the two services. The current Apple feature requires users to point their iPhone to the sky to find a satellite. The Starlink option, meanwhile, is designed to work automatically — even when the phone is in a customer’s pocket.

>

>Both the Starlink and Apple satellite features are designed to work in off-the-grid areas, such as hiking trails, that don’t have cellular service. The capabilities can’t be used in places where a mobile-phone network is within reach. Support for the Apple feature is available on most current iPhone models and the company plans to bring it to its Ultra smartwatch later this year, Bloomberg News has reported.

>

>T-Mobile updated its website this week to tell beta testers that the iPhone is supported as part of the iOS 18.3 software release. As of now, the number of users in the beta is minimal, with T-Mobile planning to expand the program in February. Apple’s announcement of iOS 18.3 touted AI features and bug fixes, but it didn’t disclose the Starlink support.

>

>SpaceX requested authority to begin beta-testing the service starting Monday. The Federal Communications Commission granted SpaceX conditional approval for its satellites to supplement T-Mobile’s cellular network in November.

2025-01-27 12:06:13,Tesla,TSLA,The Case for TSLA: the Business Value,"Many people consider TSLA to be overvalued based on fundamentals. Make no mistake - it absolutely is... based on fundamentals.

The value of TSLA, beyond the Twitter-political volatility, comes from its proven track record in achieving the impossible.

**Breaking Into an Otherwise Unbreakable Car Market**

How many new Western car companies can you recall successfully breaking into the market in the last few decades?

The only real answer is TSLA.

Everything else is bleeding money, a penny stock, or a YouTube car review channel side quest.

**Popularizing an Otherwise Undesirable and Impossible Product**

Before the EV boom, any consideration of a successful EV business would be immediately countered with legitimate concerns.

The car community wouldn't be very excited without their loud 4L V8 engines.

The product would be impossible to make as the batteries would be expensive, heavy, unreliable, and yield a low driving range. If you did get an EV, you wouldn't be able to charge it since there were no charger networks.

Not to mention the expected environmental returns from selling EVs, but generally disrupting the market and directing it towards sustainable energy cars. I love my fuel-hungry loud 6-cylinder German beast, but ICE engines in the mainstream have an expiration date and will eventually become a niche when the larger market transitions to EVs. TSLA takes the credit for this - singlehandedly. Everybody else follows.

**Scaling Up: Actually Selling Cars**

Tesla is [still leading](https://www.automotivedive.com/news/electric-vehicle-sales-us-2024-increase-cox-automotive/737528/) EV sales, and is in the [top 10](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/06/top-10-best-selling-cars-in-the-us-in-2023.html) of all car sales. Meanwhile, VW is closing down their factories in Germany.

**Advertisement by Word of Mouth**

You see Ford Focus 1.0 EcoBoost billboard ads everywhere in Europe, and RAM / JEEP / Chevy Silverado / F-150 / Hyundai / Kia ads everywhere in the US.

TSLA built itself on word of mouth and a vision for the future, which is a testament to its value for customers.

**Elon's Proven Track Record in Business**

[Winning](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/16/science/spacex-moon-nasa.html) NASA award contracts in competition with Blue Origin and other space companies, [catching](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp66ye6ep63o) skyscraper sized objects landing, and a Roadster [roaming](https://www.astronomy.com/science/astronomers-just-deleted-an-asteroid-because-it-turned-out-to-be-elon-musks-tesla-roadster/) through space are just a few of the business and technological achievements of Elon Musk (not to mention the side quests). With someone so unreasonably effective at building things that work, investors project that TSLA is a safe and promising bet.

How many reusable rockets has anybody else caught landing recently?

**Criticisms**

No product or company is without criticisms. From the bad build quality, to the still-unfulfilled FSD promises, to the lack of Cybertrucks in Europe, to the removal of the turn signal stalks; and most recently, the political criticisms.

**Consequential Actions, Not Ideologies, Drive the World**

The bottom line for a business is creating products and services that people love, and there are *zero* indicators that TSLA, as a business, is going anywhere. It thrives *despite* all criticism (of which I do think most is reasonable) and lack of marketing, which is a testament to the value they provide.

**Market Temper Tantrums Are a Feature, Not a Bug**

Look beyond the ephemeral temper tantrum-driven volatility of the market.

Last year, in March, GOOG dipped from 160 to 135 when Gemini generated some questionable images; today it's close to ATH at >200.

Last year, in August, CRWD dipped from 380 to 220 when they pushed out a buggy update. (How dare they, a software company, pushing a buggy update?!) Today, it's trading close to ATH again.

Today, the market finally noticed DeepSeek and is going through yet another mental breakdown.

It is like a palm tree: it will bend but it won't break.

Learn to put your prejudices aside and buy companies that execute well - not companies with a nice little PR team that will sweet talk you.

**But Is It Overpriced?**

By traditional fundamentals analysis - of course it is. But we've already established there's nothing traditional about TSLA as a company, so your little P/E ratio calculations won't work. They have failed consistently.

Look at the execution of TSLA and compare it to its Western competitors - they aren't even in the same league.",0,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ib78ft/the_case_for_tsla_the_business_value/
2025-01-24 14:10:57,Tesla,TSLA,TSLA - will Musk step back as CEO?,"Since he is currently focusing on other activities being involved with the US government, it might be that he will step back as CEO. Maybe his latest actions were on purpose, so that he can be officially removed by the TSLA shareholders. Do you think it might be beneficial for TSLA if he leaves? Do you think it is even possible that he leaves?

Anyone who was around at the time can testify that this really did represent consensus opinions in this sub at that time, which you can see in the comments of that post.  Note that the game store madness did not really begin until a couple weeks later, which is why it did not appear there.

I felt like it was going to play out poorly so I bookmarked it, and now have been doing yearly updates.  After all, for something like this, you really need to give it a multiple year timeline at least.

We are now on year 4, and to date I have sarcastically remarked about how the sharp, financial geniuses of the time performed against SPY and VTI.  This year I was rather surprised at the results.  All 2025 numbers use the prices right now.

In recnt times, it seems like the 4 stocks i mentioned had really amazing runs (very little precedence i'd say,for,such huge runs over,a medium length period, and eapecially for mega-caps)..  w​as there very little bad news,associated with them? Or,did investors create their bubble-like returns to some degree absent specific good news much of the time (i mean absence,of bi-weekly specific good news)

Something I've wondered for awhile.. Surprisingly i have not seen a research paper on this subject?

Right i am wondering this,about Tesla in particular.. NVDA and LLY have slowed alot.. And Planitir not a key stock

I do know AAPL didn't have a meaningful earnings miss for a long time.. 10 years or so

**Disclaimer:** I **DO NOT** own shares of XPEL at the time of writing

# Macro Overview:

**Electric Vehicle Growth**

The U.S. EV market is projected to show annual growth of 10.54% from 2025-2029, resulting in a market value of $156.3 billion by 2029 [according to Statista.](https://www.statista.com/outlook/mmo/electric-vehicles/united-states) Unit sales alone are projected to reach 2.32 million units by 2029 as well. Consumers now have significantly more choices when shopping for an electric vehicle. They can choose from offerings by [Tesla](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/), [Ford](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/F/), [GM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GM/), [Honda](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HMC/), Hyundai, and many others.

EV's often have unique aesthetic and maintenance needs that typically have high-quality protective films and coatings. The growth in consumer adoption of EV's coincides with Xpel products, particularly on the impact in the aftermarket. EV owners value vehicle preservation. This creates a growing market share for XPEL'S products. These products also include heat-reducing window films that indirectly enhance battery performance.

**Aging Vehicles**

The average car or truck on the road in the U.S in 2024, was more than 12.6 years old, a new record according to [S&P Global](https://www.spglobal.com/mobility/en/research-analysis/fuel-for-thought-average-age-vehicles-2024.html#:~:text=Vehicles%20on%20the%20road%20are,by%20two%20months%20over%202023.). Consumers now choose to keep cars longer than they used to. This is largely because of the increases in new vehicle prices. As these older vehicles age, the demand for general maintenance and preservation are more-likely to rise.

Car price increases have climbed for four consecutive months, according to [Kelley Blue Book data](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/after-4-straight-months-price-increases-new-car-now-costs-nearly-50000). As of December 2024, the average price of a new vehicle was $49,740, the second-highest level ever recorded. Economic uncertainty and higher costs can discourage new purchases. This situation favors repairs and maintenance of existing vehicles as the fleet continues to get older before replacement.

**Technological advancements**

[Self-healing films](https://www.xpel.com/products/paint-protection-film/ultimate-plus?srsltid=AfmBOopjFd4lU0Io05gEI-r8EsK9Z7gIDE7DRjI1mI7yEhQAFqPDeofN) from XPEL and competitors [3M](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MMM/), [Eastman Performance Films](https://www.eastman.com/en/who-we-are/locations/fieldale-va-usa), and [STEK Automotive](https://www.stekautomotive.com/) were released much earlier. They have recently gained traction as consumers want paint protection film to protect their vehicles. Self-healing films use polymer capable of automatically repairing minor scratches and abrasions when exposed to heat. As vehicles on the road become increasingly older, the demand for reduced effort in maintaining a vehicle's exterior will increase. Vehicle owners will likely seek easier maintenance solutions with minimal effort that repel against water, dirt, and scratches more easily. Consumers and manufacturers are increasingly adopting self-healing films. People who want to protect their older vehicles find XPEL appealing. It is also chosen to keep luxury cars in pristine condition.

# Investment Thesis:

XPEL is a compelling investment with an attractive growth story in the automotive sector. It is supported by a strong brand presence, international expansion growth, and financial strength. With high expectations, investors should take notice in the premium valuation risks apparent. Long-term growth is certainly compelling but there are clear short-term headwinds including macroeconomic uncertainties that require careful monitoring.

* **Product Diversification:** XPEL is widely known for their paint protection films. These films contribute to 70% of total Q3 sales and grew by 2.7%. Still, products like their window film and ceramic coatings have outperformed with growth of 20.6%. [Non-automotive products](https://s204.q4cdn.com/619560229/files/doc_presentations/2024/11/Q3-2024-XPEL-Investor-Presentation.pdf) like home & office window films, antimicrobial film, and niche surface protection film also out-performed by 11.6%. Together, both segments contributed 30% to total sales. Impressive growth outperformance though has largely been a significant reason for overall revenue growth in recent quarters.
* **International Expansion:** U.S. sales are the largest contributor to total revenue, accounting for 57.2% of the total and reaching $64.6 million in Q3, reflecting year-over-year growth of 9.4%. Despite the reliance on U.S. sales, International sales continue to outperform. Canada is the second largest contributor at 12.8% of revenue with growth of 25.7% to $14.4 million. All international markets saw growth except for the third largest market which is China. China saw a significant decline of -11.6% to just $9.06 million. The decrease was primarily attributed to XPEL's distributor working through excess inventory levels. With only a weighting of 8% of total sales, the negative growth did not hurt overall sales significantly. While XPEL faced challenges in China as well as minor growth of 4.1% and 1.4% in Europe and the U.K, strong international performance lead to record revenue.
* **Strategic Partnerships:** XPEL has established multiple strategic partnerships to expand its market presence. Recent collaborations with brands like [Tesla](https://lp.xpel.com/tesla-window-film), [Kia](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241030688212/en/XPEL-Showcases-New-Products-and-Collaborations-at-SEMA-2024), exclusive [Rivian](https://s204.q4cdn.com/619560229/files/doc_news/XPEL-and-Rivian-Expand-Collaboration-With-New-PPF-and-Window-Film-Program-2024.pdf) supplier partnership, [BMW](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241030688212/en/XPEL-Showcases-New-Products-and-Collaborations-at-SEMA-2024), and [Team Penske](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelharley/2024/07/10/xpel-partners-with-team-penske-to-protect-indycars-and-drivers/) have been formed. These collaborations, including with service providers like [Tint World](https://www.tintworld.com/news-media/news-and-press/industry-leaders-tint-world-and-xpel-announce-partnership/), have strengthened market presence. Brand visibility and revenue growth have also increased as a result. The Tesla partnership in particular is of major importance due to their dominance in the EV market. These recent collaborations integrate XPEL's wide array of products into solutions for high-profile vehicles and events. The partnerships with Tesla and Rivian are particularly significant. They expand their reach into the electric vehicle market that continues to rapidly grow in the U.S. and internationally.

# Risk Factors:

* **Reliance On Chinese Distribution:** [Potential tariff threats to China](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-importers-rush-goods-china-trump-tariff-threat-looms-2025-01-15/) from a new administration will significantly impact XPEL if enacted. If new tariffs are applied, XPEL will be faced with increases in far materials leading to higher production costs. With the U.S market as the largest source of revenue at 57.2%, passing on further costs to consumers would likely reduce demand. Most importantly, reliance on one distributor could lead to supply chain constraints due to an over-reliance on one company. Price increases or delayed deliveries would harm relationships and hurt XPEL's brand.
* **The Culper Research Short Report:** On October 19, 2023, [Culper Research issued a short report](https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/cc91fda7-4669-4d1b-81ce-a0b8d77f25ab/downloads/Culper_XPEL_10-19-2023.pdf?ver=1733419998410) sending XPEL's stock retreating -17.3% from $51.51 per share to $42.61. A notable accusation was XPEL's understated reliance on Tesla. [XPEL responded](https://ppfmag.com/short-seller-targets-xpel/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) by stating Tesla represented just 5% of 2023 revenue. Secondly, Culper believes XPEL is concealing a massive risk. Their primary supplier, ""Entrotech, Inc"", has formed a [joint venture with PPG Industries](https://news.ppg.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2023/PPG-launches-paint-films-solutions-for-automotive-and-industrial-customers/default.aspx) on May 23, 2023. Lastly, Culper's claim as seen below, would have massive repercussions for XPEL if they are correct.
* **Additional Culper Info:** The validity of Culper's claims on XPEL and others have been [called into question many times](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/827876/000166357721000030/ex99_1.htm) for self-benefiting public statements. What we do know for sure is the joint venture with PPG Industries is in fact truthful. The extent of which XPEL will become obsolete on the other is a highly questionable take. For some reason, Culper did not mention that XPEL stands out due to their DAP software. It is not because of the PPF raw material. Hence, XPEL would know exactly how much material and company their products were installed on. These allegations were made in 2023. XPEL has continued to show strong growth. The company has not skipped a beat.

# Conclusion

XPEL offers an attractive growth story in the automotive industry. This growth is supported by their strong market position and international expansion. The company also has a diverse product portfolio and strategic partnerships. A P/E ratio of 23.98 certainly wouldn't be viewed as cheap by any measures. Still, their P/E is significantly below their five-year average P/E of 41.6. Long-term growth remains compelling with the expectation of double-digit growth in the next two years.

Nonetheless, there are near-term headwinds. Sure, XPEL has displayed a history of growth, but near-term macroeconomic uncertainties regarding tariff concerns are worth monitoring. XPEL must consider how to react to such challenges since their distributor is based in China. For the reasons noted above, we still believe XPEL is a compelling BUY. It offers long-term sustainable growth, strategic partnerships, international expansion, and a strong balance sheet.",2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1i6ij9n/xpel_analyzing_growth_potential_in_the_automotive/

2025-01-14 00:21:10,Tesla,TSLA,China Discusses Sale of TikTok US to Musk as One Possible Option,"Bloomberg: Chinese officials are evaluating a potential option that involves Elon Musk acquiring the US operations of TikTok if the company fails to fend off a controversial ban on the short-video app, according to people familiar with the matter.

Beijing officials strongly prefer that TikTok remains under the ownership of parent ByteDance Ltd., the people say, and the company is contesting the impending ban with an appeal to the US Supreme Court. But the justices signaled during arguments on Jan. 10 that they are likely to uphold the law. Senior Chinese officials had already begun to debate contingency plans for TikTok as part of an expansive discussion on how to work with Donald Trump’s administration, one of which involves Musk, said the people, asking not to be identified revealing confidential discussions.

A potential high-profile deal with one of Trump’s closest allies holds some appeal for the Chinese government, which is expected to have some say over whether TikTok is ultimately sold, said the people. Musk spent more than $250 million supporting Trump’s re-election, and has been tapped for a prominent role in improving government efficiency after the Republican takes office.

Under one scenario that’s been discussed by the Chinese government, Musk’s X — the former Twitter — would take control of TikTok US and run the businesses together, the people said. With more than 170 million users in the US, TikTok could bolster X’s efforts to attract advertisers. Musk also founded a separate artificial intelligence company, xAI, that could benefit from the huge amounts of data generated from TikTok.

Chinese officials have yet to reach any firm consensus about how to proceed and their deliberations are still preliminary, the people said. It’s not clear how much ByteDance knows about the Chinese government discussions or whether TikTok and Musk have been involved. It’s also unclear whether Musk, TikTok and ByteDance have held any talks about the terms of any possible deal.

Musk and his representatives did not respond to a request for comment. Musk posted in April that he thinks TikTok should remain available in the US. “In my opinion, TikTok should not be banned in the USA, even though such a ban may benefit the X platform,” he wrote on X. “Doing so would be contrary to freedom of speech and expression. It is not what America stands for.”

ByteDance and TikTok representatives didn’t respond to messages seeking comment. The Cyberspace Administration of China and China’s Ministry of Commerce, government agencies that could be involved in decisions about TikTok’s future, also didn’t respond to requests for comment.

The talks in Beijing suggest that TikTok’s fate may no longer be in ByteDance’s sole control, said the people. Chinese officials recognize they will face tough negotiations with the Trump administration over tariffs, export controls and other issues, and they see the TikTok negotiations as a potential area for reconciliation, they said.

The Chinese government holds a so-called golden share in a ByteDance affiliate that gives it influence over the company’s strategy and operations. TikTok maintains that the control only applies to the China-based subsidiary Douyin Information Service Co., and has no bearing on ByteDance operations outside China. Still, Beijing’s export rules prevent Chinese companies from selling their software algorithms, like the one integral to TikTok. Because the Chinese government would have to approve of a sale that includes TikTok’s valuable recommendation engine, it has a significant voice in any possible deal.

TikTok’s US operations could be valued at around $40 billion to $50 billion, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Mandeep Singh and Damian Reimertz estimated last year. That’s a substantial sum even for the world’s richest person. It’s not clear how Musk could pull off such a transaction, whether it would require the sale of other holdings, or whether the US government would approve. He paid $44 billion for Twitter in 2022, and is still paying off sizable loans.

Musk has a positive reputation among many ByteDance employees in China, according to a person familiar with the matter. He is seen as a very successful entrepreneur, who has experience engaging with the Chinese government through his Tesla Inc. business, the person added.

ByteDance’s leaders have repeatedly said their priority is to fight US legislation that requires the Beijing-based company sell or shut down the US operations because of national security concerns. TikTok’s lawyers have argued the legislation violates free speech laws under the Constitution’s First Amendment.

A majority of the Supreme Court justices suggested the security concerns take priority over free speech, although they have yet to issue a formal decision. President-elect Trump, who takes office Jan. 20, has sought to delay the TikTok ban — which takes effect Jan. 19 — so he can work on the negotiations. He has said he wants to “save” the app and there’s been speculation he could take last-minute action to sidestep the ban.

On a practical level, spinning off TikTok’s US business would be highly complex, affecting shareholders in China as well as the US. Lawyers for TikTok argued before the Supreme Court that separating the US portions of the product would be “extraordinarily difficult.”

It’s unclear if US TikTok would be sold off in a competitive process, or if a sale would be arranged by the government. Billionaire Frank McCourt and “Shark Tank” investor Kevin O’Leary are part of a bid through Project Liberty to acquire TikTok, which O’Leary has said he discussed with Trump. In the past, Microsoft Corp. had sought to acquire the business, and Oracle Corp. has a deep technology partnership with the company.

One alternative for TikTok would be to move its existing US customers over to a similar app — with different branding — to potentially sidestep the ban, one of the people said. It’s not clear how effective such a move would be.

One person close to the company, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the strategy, said before the Supreme Court hearing that the legal battle is still the focus of top executives and they would prefer to keep fighting in the US rather than sell TikTok US and cede control for good.

Musk is in a position to influence the China-US relationship as the world’s richest person with businesses that straddle the world’s two largest economies. Tesla, where Musk is chief executive officer, erected a sprawling factory in Shanghai in 2019 and has since expanded the facility into the company’s largest production base. The effort helped Tesla expand its market share in China despite tough local competition, and build goodwill with government officials.

While Trump is staffing his incoming administration with China hawks like Secretary of State nominee Marco Rubio, Musk has spoken out against some recent China trade policies, including the Biden administration’s tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles.

**Thoughts:** Obviously this type of news has the ability to move TSLA/META/social networks. We've seen TSLA make moves from political news, SpaceX news, Twitter news, and TSLA trades as a proxy to whatever Elon Musk is doing at the time even if it's not directly applicable to TSLA as a company. 

Very low probability of it happening but interesting to brainstorm trading ideas.

2025-01-04 13:17:56,Tesla,TSLA,Arcadium Lithium says shareholders approved Rio Tinto deal,"Shareholders of Arcadium Lithium have given the green light for a $6.7 billion sale to Australian mining heavyweight Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO), as announced by the company on Monday.

This news was met with positivity in the stock market, with Arcadium's shares climbing over 2% in after-hours trading.

However, the path to the deal is not without its obstacles. Arcadium is currently dealing with legal challenges from a section of its shareholders.

These shareholders have lodged lawsuits against the company, accusing it of misrepresentation, concealment, and negligence in relation to the takeover deal. This information was disclosed by Arcadium in a regulatory filing earlier this month.

Earlier in the year, Rio Tinto stated its intention to acquire Arcadium at a price of $5.85 per share, which was paid in cash. This purchase price represented a nearly 90% premium on Arcadium's closing stock price on October 4, the day a potential deal was first reported by Reuters.

The acquisition will grant Rio Tinto access to Arcadium's lithium mines, processing facilities, and deposits located in Argentina, Australia, Canada, and the United States.

Additionally, Rio Tinto will also inherit Arcadium's customer base, which includes major automotive manufacturers such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), BMW (ETR:BMWG), and General Motors (NYSE:GM).",11,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hte6xi/arcadium_lithium_says_shareholders_approved_rio/
2025-01-04 08:04:26,Tesla,TSLA,Is it worth it to invest time into learning technical analysis? ,"For context, I've been buying stocks and options since I turned 18 around 3 months ago, so I don't have a lot of experience or knowledge in the first place. I've just been making moves based on my own research combined with other people's ideas. I was looking through a discord where people share their ideas as I wanted to expand my portfolio past being 65% NVDA and 35% random bullshit, and I often see these pictures of daily 5 minute candles with countless horizontal, diagonal, and curvy lines. The poster then mentions various names for some candlestick patterns and says something about how the stock closed above/under the EMA or some crap then proceeds to justify their following move, seeming to have full confidence because of this chart they drew.

So I thought, if I could go by the book and use rules and numbers to get a solid guess on which way the stock's gonna go, I'd be rich. But if it were that easy, everyone would be rich. And one look through this r/wallstreetbets makes it clear that there's not a lot of people who have achieved that status.

I'm posting to ask if learning about all this is worth it. I know that the market is unpredictable and there's no way looking at a bunch of lines will give me a positive winrate, but does it help? For example, could you have a better chance at guessing what's gonna happen in the next 30 minutes if you recognized the pattern that came before it? I know that I cannot expect the book to be right all the time, but would it at least give me a better shot at it?

I haven't tried this at all and so far I've been doing fine, though I know the stuff I've bought have been nice to me in the months I've held it and I can't expect the same in the future (I started with 7k, now at 9k, with 50% of gains unrealized from mostly NVDA and RKLB, 50% of gains realized from TSLA and NVDA calls bought post-election). I know reading these patterns won't help in the long run, as I'm holding shares and am not planning to sell in the foreseeable future, but I want to understand what these people are talking about when they do TAs and try it for myself to see if it actually helps or not. Maybe try buying 0dte for SPY and QQQ to harvest some loss porn for WSB.

2024-12-10 23:07:41,Tesla,TSLA,Siemens - worth a look? A balanced view.,"Purpose of this post is to get a sense of 'sentiment' about Siemens. It's not a lazy $hit post, asking ""what do y'all think yo""? But yeah, essentially, that's what I am asking, besides listing down a long list of pros and cons of the company.

I've no position yet (long or short), but thinking of it.

Pros:

1. The conglomerate needs no introduction. There's virtually NO piece of any complex, industrial machinery (boats, planes, turbines, large diesel engines, data center infrastructure, heating, cooling, all kinds of factories, power plant, high voltage transformer...) that doesn't have at least a few critical components made by Siemens. The company stands to benefit from **energy transition, mobility, urbanization** (smart cities), and is focused on **high-margin** specialized components.
2. Valuations: 18 PE, 1.9 PS [Siemens AG - Google Finance](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/SIE:ETR?window=YTD)
3. News: there's plenty of positive news and developments [Google News ](https://news.google.com/search?for=siemens&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en) Most notably, partnership with NVDA for industrial robotics applications. Won a few contracts in the middle East. 
4. Gaining momentum: for last 10 days at least, the trading volume is virtually all **BUY volume**. BUY volume means the trades were executed at 'ask' price. Buyers had to up their bids to get hands on the stock.
5. Low retail concentration: only 19% retail shareholders. Less susceptible to 'crowd' thinking. It's not your GME or TSLA which will up/down 10% in a day. Movements will be very slow and steady. In other words, low volatality. It's a steady wealth builder with 14% YTD; don't expect 500% in 5 years.

Cons:

1. German company. Yes, yes, we know Germany is in recession, aging population, generally hard business climate.. etc etc. But the company's operations are global. The only geographical 'risk' is, you've a stock in EUR currency, not traded as ADR on US exchange (as far as I know). Revenues come from all over the world, in many currencies.
2. Lot of competition: ABB, GE, Hitachi, Mitsubishi, Larsen & Toubro.. may not be retail, well known names, but they all do the same stuff, some better; some worse. It's all about winning a large government / private contracts.",19,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hbf2zb/siemens_worth_a_look_a_balanced_view/
2024-12-10 14:42:37,Tesla,TSLA,Google shares rise on new quantum chip breakthrough,"

Shares of Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) saw a 4% increase in pre-open trading Tuesday, reflecting investor confidence following the company's unveiling of its new quantum computing chip, Willow. Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, introduced the chip on Monday, highlighting its ability to significantly reduce computational errors and its performance in benchmark tests.

Pichai emphasized the chip's potential in practical applications, stating, ""We see Willow as an important step in our journey to build a useful quantum computer with practical applications in areas like drug discovery, fusion energy, battery design + more.""

The new chip, according to Pichai, has achieved two major milestones. It can exponentially decrease errors with the addition of more qubits, addressing a quantum error correction challenge that has persisted for nearly three decades. In addition, Willow completed a standard benchmark computation in less than five minutes, a task that would take one of the fastest supercomputers today more than 10 septillion years.
This development is part of Google's long-term commitment to quantum computing, a vision that began over a decade ago when Pichai founded Google Quantum (NASDAQ:QMCO) AI in 2012. 

The goal is to build a quantum computer that leverages quantum mechanics to advance scientific discovery and address societal challenges.

The announcement drew a simple yet telling reaction from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, who expressed his astonishment with a single word, ""wow,"" on social media platform X.

The Willow chip represents a significant advancement for Google Quantum AI and positions the company closer to achieving commercially viable quantum computing applications.",499,189,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hb39my/google_shares_rise_on_new_quantum_chip/

TSLA +5% overnight due to this news.

  
(Bloomberg) -- Members of President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team have told advisers they plan to make a federal framework for fully self-driving vehicles one of the Transportation Department’s priorities, according to people familiar with the matter.

If new rules enable cars without human controls, that would directly benefit Elon Musk, the Tesla Inc. chief executive officer and Trump mega-donor who has become a powerful fixture in the president-elect’s inner circle. He has bet the future of the EV maker on self-driving technology and artificial intelligence.

Current federal rules pose significant roadblocks for companies looking to deploy vehicles without steering wheels or foot pedals in large quantities, which Tesla plans to do. The Trump team is looking for policy leaders for the department to develop a framework to regulate self-driving vehicles, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly.

While the Transportation Department, through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, can issue rules that would make it easier to run autonomous vehicles, an act of Congress would clear the way for mass adoption of self-driving cars. A bipartisan legislative measure being discussed in early stages would create federal rules around AVs, two of the people said.

One candidate under consideration for Transportation secretary is Emil Michael, a former Uber Technologies Inc. executive who has spoken with Trump’s team and potential staffers, they said. The work is in its early stages and policy details have yet to be determined, they said. 

Republican Representatives Sam Graves of Missouri and Garret Graves of Louisiana have also been considered to lead the department, the people said.

The transition team didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Musk in October announced plans to produce large numbers of driverless Tesla robotaxis that lack driver controls starting in 2026. Current US regulations pose significant hurdles to Musk’s plans for the so-called Cybercab, including a cap limiting their deployment. 

He supported federal rules for autonomy on Tesla’s third-quarter earnings call, saying he’d use any role with the government to push for a process to allow autonomous vehicles to be used nationwide. The pronouncement prompted a selloff of shares of Uber and rival Lyft Inc.

Trump has since named Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency initiative to “dismantle government bureaucracy” and slash spending and regulations deemed overly burdensome.

Past efforts to come up with federal legislation to regulate autonomous vehicles have stumbled.

NHTSA currently permits manufacturers to deploy 2,500 self-driving vehicles per year under a granted exemption, but legislative efforts to increase that number to as many as 100,000 have repeatedly failed.

A bill to do that sailed through the House several years ago during Trump’s first term, but the measure has been bogged down in the Senate. An attempt during the first year of the Biden administration to merge the bill with other legislation faltered when some manufacturers tried to include language that would prevent consumers from suing or forming class-action cases.",277,62,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gtwjvx/trump_team_is_seeking_to_ease_us_rules_for/

2024-10-23 20:16:25,Tesla,TSLA,Tesla shares jump 6% on profit beat,"* Tesla reported third-quarter earnings on Wednesday that topped analysts’ estimates even as revenue came in just shy of expectations.

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** 72 cents vs. 58 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $25.18 billion vs. $25.37 billion expected

Revenue increased 8% in the quarter from $23.35 billion a year earlier. Net income rose to about $2.17 billion, or 62 cents a share, from $1.85 billion, or 53 cents s share, a year ago.

Tesla’s profit margins were bolstered by $739 million in automotive regulatory credit revenue during the quarter. The company has also been offering an array of discounts and incentives to spur sales.

Automotive revenue increased 2% to $20 billion from $19.63 billion in the same period a year earlier. Energy generation and storage revenue soared 52% to $2.38 billion, while services and other revenue jumped 29% to $2.79 billion.

Operating margin was reported at 10.8% of sales to improve from last quarter's mark of 6.3%, and top last year's mark of 7.6%. Total GAAP gross margin was 19.8% vs. 17.9% a year ago and 18.0% in the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $4.67 billion vs. $3.76 billion a year ago. For the quarter, the EV juggernaut's adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 18.5% of sales from 16.1% a year ago.

Tesla had already disclosed 462,890 deliveries for Q3. The electric vehicle maker said it produced 469,796 vehicles during the quarter. Tesla noted that 3% of the deliveries were subject to operating lease accounting. For reference, Tesla delivered 443,956 vehicles in Q2 of this year and 435,059 vehicles in Q3 of last year. Tesla's  all-time deliveries record was 484,507 vehicles in Q4 of 2023. Looking ahead, Tesla reiterated that plans for new vehicles, including more affordable models, remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025.

# More than just EVs

Tesla said energy storage deployments decreased sequentially in Q3 to a record 6.9 GWh, but were up 75% Y/Y. Overall, Tesla said energy services and other businesses are becoming increasingly profitable parts of the company. ""As energy storage products continue to ramp, and our vehicle fleet continues to grow, we are expecting continued profit growth from these businesses over time,"" noted TSLA. The company also said that it deployed and is training ahead of schedule on a 29k H100 cluster at Gigafactory Texas, where it expects to have 50k H100 capacity by the end of October.

# Balance sheet

Tesla ended the quarter with a cash position of $33.6 billion. The sequential increase of $2.9 billion was a result of positive free cash flow of $2.7 billion. Operating cash flow was $6.3 billion during the quarter.

**SUMMARY**

We delivered strong results in Q3 with growth in vehicle deliveries both sequentially and year-on-year, resulting in record third-quarter volumes. We also recognized our second-highest quarter of regulatory credit revenues as other OEMs are still behind on meeting emissions requirements.

Our cost of goods sold (COGS) per vehicle came down to its lowest level ever at \~$35,100. In order to continue accelerating the world’s transition to sustainable energy, we need to make EVs affordable for everyone, including making total cost of ownership per mile competitive with all forms of transportation. Preparations remain underway for our offering of new vehicles – including more affordable models – which we will begin launching in the first half of 2025. At our ""We, Robot"" event on October 10, we detailed our long-term goal of offering autonomous transport with a cost per mile below rideshare, personal car ownership, and even public transit.

The Energy business achieved another strong quarter with a record gross margin. Additionally, the Megafactory in Lathrop produced 200 Megapacks in a week, and Powerwall deployments reached a record for the second quarter in a row as we continue to ramp Powerwall 3.

Despite sustained macroeconomic headwinds and others pulling back on EV investments, we remain focused on expanding our vehicle and energy product lineup, reducing costs and making critical investments in AI projects and production capacity. We believe these efforts will allow us to capitalize on the ongoing transition in the transportation and energy sectors.",342,474,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gak7c4/tesla_shares_jump_6_on_profit_beat/
2024-10-23 12:35:32,Tesla,TSLA,Alphabet To $7 Trillion By 2025?,"We believe Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) is positioned to grow its valuation by well over 3x from the already huge $2-trillion figure now – potentially becoming the world’s most valuable company by a huge margin – as its often-overlooked Waymo autonomous driving business quietly revolutionizes the transportation sector. This would take the stock to over $500 a share. Here’s why.

Fact: Waymo has grown the number of weekly paid rides from 10,000 to over 100,000 in the last 12 months. It went from 50,000 weekly rides to 100,000 just in the last six months.

The growth is compelling and the addressable market is massive

Case in point: Uber does more than 200 million rides each week. Let’s let that sink in. So if autonomous rides can capture even half that market, that would mean 100 million rides per week. That’s about 1,000 times where Waymo is today. 200 million rides a week translates to about a billion a month and over 10 billion a year. At $30 per ride, we’re talking revenues of close to $300 billion per year.

But wait… there is more to the growth story

If Waymo is already delivering over 100,000 driverless rides, how many more people might switch from driving their cars to being driven by autonomous vehicles? The shift could be massive. For each person hailing a cab, there are at least 10 others driving their own cars. Many of these drivers might reconsider once they see millions of people relaxing in the back seat, streaming Netflix, while they’re stuck behind the wheel.

In fact, early data backs this up. According to Earnest Analytics, Waymo is already retaining riders at a higher rate compared to other ride-hailing services like Uber or Lyft. People enjoy the experience of autonomous vehicles. Safety could also be another attraction. Waymo published a report last year indicating that its autonomous vehicles achieved an 85% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to national rates for human-operated cars.

Investors will soon recognize that the $300 billion revenue figure for the current ride-hailing market has substantial growth potential – it could easily expand by 2-3x. A $1 trillion market for autonomous rides isn’t out of the question. This growth would also translate to significant revenue opportunities for automakers like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which are working on their driverless vehicle technologies.

But wait aren’t so many automakers and tech players working on autonomous driving?

Yes, but not all of them are making the same progress. Waymo has a head start in the market. Its main competitor, General Motor’s backed Cruise lost its driverless permits in California after a serious accident, making Waymo the only publicly available robotaxi service in San Francisco. Uber exited its self-driving taxi program about six years ago and has partnered with Waymo to bring its services to the Uber app in some cities. While electric vehicle behemoth Tesla is seen as a leader of sorts in the self-driving space, given its large base of vehicles, it is only slowly getting into the space after the unveiling of its Robotaxi vehicle earlier this month.

Waymo has some advantages in terms of tech as well. It uses a fleet equipped with high-resolution cameras, LiDAR, and radar systems, creating a comprehensive view of its surroundings. And don’t forget Google’s got a secret weapon. It crowdsources annotated data such as CAPTCHA codes from its massive user base, using that to train its machine-learning models. That’s a big advantage in terms of understanding complex driving environments.

The best part?

These are self-driving cars – no human drivers, no unions, no employee or contractor issues, and no human cost. While there will be other expenses, such as software development and battery costs, the absence of driver wages could lead to exceptionally high margins. Margins of 50% aren’t unrealistic when you consider that driver earnings account for a substantial portion of gross fares in traditional ride-hailing models.

If Waymo can capture about one-third of the $1 trillion autonomous rides market, it could generate annual revenues of around $300 billion. With a 50% margin, that’s a neat $150 billion in profits. What’s that worth? At a 30x earnings multiple, that would imply an additional valuation of about $4.5 trillion for Alphabet. Considering that Alphabet is worth roughly $2 trillion presently, this could take the company’s market cap to over $6.5 trillion, or over $500 per share.

To be sure, building this sort of scale can take a good deal of time – quite different from signing up for say a Google or Netflix account. However, investors will need to look well out into the future. Think 2030 (not 2025), maybe even more. The point is not to get stuck – if you’re concerned, look even further out, say 2035! The bottom line: Alphabet is growing Waymo quickly, has the technology and competitive edge, and is addressing a potentially massive market, making this high valuation within reach.

2024-10-12 15:03:00,Tesla,TSLA,"Ride-sharing giants Uber, Lyft jump after Tesla’s ‘toothless taxi’ fails to excite investors","Tesla’s hyped robotaxi unveiling posed a threat to Uber’s ride-sharing aspirations, but it has turned into a boon for the stock instead.

Uber shares had been falling on the initial investor excitement leading up to Thursday’s event — particularly slumping in early August and mid-September — but surged more than 9% on Friday on renewed enthusiasm that the company is well positioned to advance its autonomous vehicle offerings. The move pushed the stock to a 52-week high and it was leading the S&P 500 higher during the session.

That is a massive turnaround for Uber’s stock, which is now up nearly 22% over the past month and about 38% for the year. Lyft, another major player, is also surging about 10% on Friday. By comparison, Tesla’s shares are plunging during Friday’s trading session and are down more than 11% this year, vastly underperforming both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, which have each gained around 22% so far this year.

The buzz around Tesla’s highly anticipated cybercab has largely dissipated due to a lack of detail on its latest full self-driving technology advancements and the company’s failure to provide insight on its ride-sharing service strategy or economics, among other expectations investors had.

“TSLA’s toothless taxi is a best-case outcome for UBER,” Jefferies analyst John Colantuoni said in a Friday note, noting that the electric car maker provided ambitious targets but little signs of feasibility.

Tesla shares drop 6% in premarket after Cybercab robotaxi reveal fails to impress","Shares of electric vehicle maker Tesla tumbled Friday after the company’s long-awaited robotaxi event — where CEO Elon Musk unveiled the firm’s Cybercab self-driving concept car — failed to impress investors.

Tesla stock was down 5.8% as of 6:33 a.m. ET in premarket trading on Friday.

Musk revealed Tesla’s Cybercab concept vehicle — a low, silver two-seater, has no steering wheels or pedals — on Thursday night. The plan is for the car to be capable of driving itself autonomously when it launches.

The Tesla boss said the company hopes to be producing the Cybercab before 2027, but offered no details on where the cars will be manufactured. He said consumers would be able to buy a Tesla Cybercab for a price tag under $30,000.

He also said he expects Tesla to have “unsupervised FSD” up and running in Texas and California next year in the company’s Model 3 and Model Y electric vehicles. FSD, which stands for Full Self-Driving, is Tesla’s premium driver assistance system, available today in a “supervised” version for Tesla electric vehicles.

The technology still requires a human driver at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.

In reaction to the Thursday event, analysts at Barclays said that the revelations had failed to highlight any near-term opportunities for Tesla, instead prioritizing Musk’s vision for a fully autonomous driving future.

“As expected, like prior Tesla product unveils, the event was light on the details, and instead emphasized the vision underpinning Tesla’s growth endeavors in AI/AV \[autonomous vehicles\],” Barclays’ U.S. autos & mobility team wrote in the note early on Friday.

“Yet there were no updates indicating near-term opportunities. Tesla didn’t show its low-cost model planned for 1H′25 production,” they added. “We also didn’t get any near-term updates on FSD progress, or data reflecting improvement in the system.”

Piper Sandler analysts said in a separate Friday note that “most trading-oriented firms will be underwhelmed by the robo-taxi unveiling.”

“We wouldn’t be surprised if the stock sells off in the coming weeks, as pre-event momentum fizzles,” the investment bank’s analysts said in the note.

Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, suggested that Musk failed to make the case that Tesla is an AI company during the event. The bank’s analysts noted that Musk didn’t mention any details on improvements to Tesla’s FSD system, nor did the billionaire go into detail regarding rumored plans of a tie-up between Tesla and xAI, Musk’s AI company. Musk has previously denied such reports.

The event “overall disappointed expectations on a number of areas: a lack of data regarding rate-of-change on FSD/tech, ride-share economics and go-to-market strategy,” Morgan Stanley’s analysts wrote in a note Friday.

“We were overall disappointed with the substance and detail of the presentation. As such, we anticipate TSLA to be under pressure following the event,” they added.

It is expected to take some years still before self-driving cars become a mainstream reality on public roads, with regulators concerned over the safety features embedded into such vehicles.

Among the few companies that have successfully launched self-driving cars on public roads is Google’s Waymo, which has offered its robotaxi service to the general public since June.",1697,563,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g18fon/tesla_shares_drop_6_in_premarket_after_cybercab/
2024-10-09 19:41:32,Tesla,TSLA,Any of you buying into Musk's robotaxi announcement tomorrow?,"Seems like every other major autoindustry and freight players already has some sort of autonomous fleet in the works and on the streets.  
TSLA does have an advantage of ai + their cameras + tons of real world auto driving data, but they lack lidar.

Could it be that Tesla's version of robotaxi will use something like tech from AUR, MBLY, LAZR?

2024-10-02 13:10:06,Tesla,TSLA,"Tesla stock slips after it reports 462,890 total deliveries during the third quarter","Tesla posted its third-quarter vehicle production and deliveries report on Wednesday. The stock fell about 2% in premarket trading after the report.

Here are the key numbers:

Total deliveries Q3 2024: 462,890

Total production Q3 2024: 469,796

Analysts were expecting deliveries of 463,310 in the period ending Sept. 30, according to estimates compiled by FactSet StreetAccount.

Deliveries are not defined in Tesla’s financial disclosures, but are the closest approximation to units sold reported by the company. It’s one of the most closely-watched metrics on Wall Street.

In the year-ago period, Tesla reported 435,059 deliveries and production of 430,488 EVs. Last quarter, the company reported 443,956 deliveries, and production of 410,831 vehicles.

Tesla is facing increased competitive pressure, especially in China, from companies like BYD and Geely, along with a new generation of automakers, including Li Auto and Nio.

In the U.S., EV competitors like Rivian are maturing, while legacy automakers Ford and General Motors are selling more electric vehicles after walking back more ambitious goals for electrification.

GM this week reported a roughly 60% increase in EV sales for the third quarter from a year earlier. Still, its electric business is tiny compared to Tesla’s, with just 32,100 units sold in the latest period, accounting for 4.9% of the company’s total sales.

Ford plans to report results on Wednesday.

Tesla hasn’t issued specific guidance for 2024 deliveries, but executives have said they expect a lower delivery growth rate this year versus last despite the company having added a new vehicle, the angular stainless steel Cybertruck, to their lineup.

The company also said on Wednesday that it deployed 6.9 GWh of energy storage products in the quarter.

Shares of Tesla climbed 32% in the third quarter, erasing their loss for the year in the process. The stock is now up almost 4% in 2024, trailing the Nasdaq, which has gained 19%.

Tesla’s brand has been under pressure in the U.S. due in part to the antics of CEO Elon Musk, who, in addition to endorsing former President Donald Trump, has shared what the White House called “racist hate,” and false claims about immigrants and election fraud on X, his social media app.

But Tesla still sells more battery electric vehicles in the U.S. than any other automaker, with Hyundai a distant second.

In its third-quarter earnings report later this month, investors will be particularly focused on profit margins.

Tesla has continued to offer attractive financing options and an array of incentives to drive sales volume in recent months in China as well as in the U.S. Prior to earnings, Tesla will host a marketing event on Oct. 10, and is expected to show off the design of “dedicated robotaxi.”

Musk has promised Tesla self-driving cars for years, but the company has yet to deliver. Meanwhile competitors like Waymo and Pony.ai have begun operating commercial robotaxi services.

2024-10-01 15:23:05,Tesla,TSLA,The Crash of the stock market has arrived. Price/Earnings ratio just broke 30 for the entire S&P 500. ,"Almost 90 days ago I made a post in an alternate subreddit regarding why I believe the stock market will begin to crash within 120 days -- Essentially the crash will begin by the day before the election. I have included that entire post below -- and all of these reasons still remain relevant... Moreso than ever with the news from the Middle East today. Obviously the port strike is expediting things today. Nonetheless -- I think the post is super relevant, and for some reason, the moderators of WSB deleted the post after 6 hours, despite it receiving over 2.2 million views, and over 1100 shares. 

The ride the market has been on, quite simply, has been insane.

According to generally accepted wisdom -- by investing in the S&P 500, you can anticipate to double your money, on average, every 6.5 years. I'm not 100% certain as to why that's the accepted figure -- as calculating the last 14 6.5 year periods the average rate of return has been 64%.

Below is a chart of the average price/rate of return of GSPC (The S&P) over the last 14 cycles.. I couldn't easily find data prior to this..

While the last two cycles don't necessarily ring any alarm bells -- we have just more than doubled, twice, looking at the last two cycles -- There is one massive, bloated, shit filled elephant in the room... Price to Earnings Ratio.

Historically, the Price to Earnings ratio for the S&P has sat just under 20 (the easiest data I could find puts it at 19.4x between 1974 and 2017 -- I'm not grabbing any arbitrary dates or numbers here). The Median value has it under 18x, and there have even been extended periods of time where it traded at +/- 10x.

Currently -- the P/E ratio sits at 28.71 -- roughly 150% of what is normal.

In the history of the S&P, the P/E ratio has hit this level only 3 times...

* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Dot Com Bubble (P/E broke 30 +/- April 2001).
* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Global Financial Crisis (P/E broke 30 +/- October 2008).
* The quarter after Covid hit. (P/E broke 30 +/- March 2020).

Images aren't allowed in this subreddit -- but if you go to the multpl website you will see we finished trading yesterday, 09/30, at a P/E of 30.07

Historically -- what has happened to the markets after crossing this mark? In all three scenarios, by the time we crossed a P/E of 30, the dam had already started to break.

* During the Dot Com bubble, the S&P 500 was already down 19% from its highs, and would fall another 34% before finally starting to recover. By the the time the bleeding stopped, it had lost 47% of its value.
* During the global financial crisis, an almost identical story can be told. The S&P had lost 18% of its value by time P/E broke 30, and when it finally bottomed out in February of 2009, it lost 53% of its total value.
* Covid, obviously, was a much quicker recovery... as we only fell 32%, and had bounced back in less than 6 months time (reason for which outlined later).

**Okay -- so** ***Maybe*** **we have a price to earnings ratio problem, but you're still not sold. What else do we have going on?**

Outside of the fact that I firmly believe that the market is overvalued today, I think there are several other major issues that we are facing in the current environment -- and while I could write a diatribe for each, for purposes of succinctness, I'll simply outline them via bullet points below.

* Credit card debt is at an all time high, and outside of a brief period after Covid checks arrived, has been rising since 2013.
* Younger Americans are in the most trouble with credit card debt. As boomers continue to retire, it will be the working class most disproportionately affected.
* Credit card delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2011.
* Auto loans debt and average auto loan payments are the highest they've been at any point in history. Auto loan delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2010.
* The stock market is insanely top heavy right now. The Magnificent 7 (Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA)) now account for 45% of the entire value of the Nasdaq. They account for roughly 30% of the entire stock market combined. As of today -- they are trading at a combined P/E of 42x. A correction in these 7 companies would be absolutely catastrophic for the entire market as a whole.
* We are starting to see a weakening of the labor market. Furthermore -- I do not believe the jobs numbers are entirely as they seem. I think many of the jobs 'added' over the last 18 months have been individuals picking up second jobs to help make ends meet. Any reasonable increase in the unemployment rate have absolutely massive consequences.
* Many banks are holding on to massive unrealized losses. While this has the potential to hit the regional banks the worst, some of the largest banks -- including Bank of America, Charles Schwab, and USAA have unbooked security losses that are greater than 50% of their equity capital.
* Regional banks are at risk due to the massive amounts of US treasury notes they hold that were bought during Covid. In short -- nobody was borrowing money to buy homes or cars. Banks, flush with cash, took said money and bought US T notes with this money so they could earn some interest on it. This was at a time when interest rates were very low. Now that interest rates are high -- demand for these old t notes is essentially non existent, as you buy new t notes that pay a much higher rate of return. If any sort of bank run starts, these banks will be forced to liquidate said t-bills, and they will have to sell them at a loss. If too many people do this simultaneously, the bank will become insolvent -- like what we saw happen with Silicon Valley bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank. (Side note -- the failure of these three banks alone was larger than the combined total of bank failures in 2008 during the global financial crisis).
* The US government still has a spending problem. Our deficit has grown by $500 million since I started writing this an hour ago.
* Global tensions are high -- and rising. Massive protests are erupting all over Europe.
* The US is involved in two proxy wars that don't appear as if they will abate any time soon.
* The political division in the US is as dramatic as I've seen it at any point in my existence. Perhaps those older and wiser than me can chime in here -- but it seems most are resorting to tribal, identity politics split down party lines.
* Commercial real estate is starting to buckle. Covid brought about work from home, and with many offices retaining those practices, or allowing partial work from home, office space supply far outpaces demand. This problem is exacerbated by high interest rates. Most commercial loans are done on 5 or 7 year balloon. When that balloon is bout to come due, the owner of that property will refinance the loan, restarting the 5 or 7 year period to avoid paying off the balance owed on the property. Many of these property owners that refinanced into low interest rates in 2020, during covid, when rates bottomed out -- are now having to get a new loan to keep from paying their balloon. However, with interest rates more than twice what they were several years ago, and vacancy rates skyrocketing, many of these real estate owners will not be able to pay the monthly mortgage on their buildings. Commercial Real Estate foreclosures jumped 117% in March alone.
* Housing has become increasingly less affordable for many Americans. For 2022 -- the most recent year I could find data -- a family earning the median US household income, renting a median priced US home, was spending 40% of their income on rent.
* Countries are abandoning the US dollar in droves.

I believe some of these issues, on their own, are enough to cause serious economic turmoil. Bundled together, I don't see how we aren't in for a very rude awakening.

**This economic downturn may be severe.**

In the three times this has happened before -- the action, or lake thereof varied dramatically. During scenario one -- the dot com bubble -- the government largely just let the companies fail. While I was only 11 at the time, my understanding is that there really were no bailouts here because the only people really hurt were the investors in those companies -- unlike scenario two. During the GFC, shuttering banks would have resulted in a complete collapse of the US (and really global) financial system. While I won't get into partisan politics, I'm of the belief that the covid bailouts were entirely unnecessary -- and more importantly for this post -- the reason that the upcoming crash is going to be so insanely problematic.

**Bailouts on any level, whether to companies, banks, or directly to citizens, will inevitably increase inflation. I don't think they are on the table for this correction.**

People have painted the inflation problem as a result of supply chain issues... And while supply chain issues didn't help, I think the bigger issue, by far, was the sheer amount of money we printed. You cannot make $4 trillion appear out of thin air and expect that every dollar in circulation isn't going to suddenly become worth less money. We just lived through this reality after the Covid printing.

This will largely tie the feds hands. Print more money -- we find ourselves in a cycle of ever increasing prices and higher interest rates.

**What happens from here?**

I don't know. Don't listen to me. I'm an idiot. Stock market will probably just continue to go up. I'm probably wrong about 100% of this.

The prediction in bold below is what I posted 90 days ago. I now believe the top is officially in -- that we won't see another ATH for a long time. 

**My Prediction? GSPC/SPY cruise up a tiny bit further, to +/- $5900/$590 -- before retreating to $3500/$350 by 12/2025.**

2024-09-27 10:04:39,Tesla,TSLA,'Safety Disaster:' Tesla FSD 'Galaxies Away From Being Anywhere Close To Competition',"* Tesla's FSD, which is now promoted as fully-supervised, is now the core technology behind the robotaxi service the company plans to launch.
* Most analysts assign hefty value for the FSD technology alone.

  
With just two weeks to go for Tesla, Inc.’s TSLA Robotaxi unveil event, an analyst painted a bleak picture of the company’s self-driving technology.



**What Happened**: Tesla’s FSD, which is now promoted as fully-supervised FSD, is a “safety disaster” and “galaxies away from being anywhere close to the competition,” said GLJ Research’s Gordon Johnson in a note. Tesla’s competitors in this arena are Alphabet, Inc.’s GOOGL GOOG Waymo and General Motors Corp.’s GM Cruise.



With Tesla eyeing the rollout of its Fully Supervised FSD in China, the Elon Musk-led company would be up against domestic player Baidu, Inc.’s BIDU Apollo Go.



Johnson referenced reviews by two sources to make his case. Independent lab AMCI Testing, which tried the technology, said the overall performance of Tesla’s camera-enabled autonomous-driving software is “suspect.” In a report released on Tuesday, the firm said its evaluation showed how often human intervention was required for safe operation. “In fact, our drivers had to intervene over 75 times during the evaluation; an average of once every 13 miles,” it said.



While the FSD 12.5.1 was impressive, it is incredibly dangerous for drivers operating with FSD to drive with their hands in their laps or away from the steering wheels, it said. “The most critical moments of FSD miscalculation are split-second events that even professional drivers, operating with a test mindset, must focus on catching,” it added.



Johnson also referred to data from [Teslafsdtracker.com](http://Teslafsdtracker.com), which aggregates TSLA FSD driving experiences/data, in real-time from users, which shows that the latest iteration of FSD has a **critical disengagement every 130 miles and every 72 miles when driven in a city.**

  
Data reported by competitors to the California Department of Motor Vehicles show that miles to disengagement data for various players are as follows:

* Waymo: 17,311 miles
* **Amazon, Inc.’s** AMZN Zoox: 177,602 miles
* [Pony.Ai](http://Pony.Ai) (startup): 17,077 miles
* WeRide (startup): 21,191 miles

The **metric for Tesla is 13 miles**, based on AMCI’s statistics, Johnson said, although Tesla doesn’t yet report data to California DMV, given its FSD tech is **only Level 2.**  


**Why It’s Important:** Johnson noted that many sell-side analysts assign a valuation of $300 billion to $600 billion for Tesla’s FSD technology. In real-time, the value is close to zero, he said, adding that it could be negative, given the “liability of putting something this dangerous on roads.”

  
According to Ark’s valuation model, by 2029, robotaxis, which has FSD as its core technology, would account for 63% of Tesla’s revenue and 86% of EBITDA.

Future Fund LLC Managing Partner Gary Black, a Tesla bull, said in a recent post on X that Tesla's FSD is not yet close to the 99.99% efficacy needed for unsupervised autonomy.



In premarket trading on Thursday, Tesla rose 2.05% to $262.30

I don’t plan on selling TSLA probably ever, but PYPL has never been a long term hold for me. I’m considering liquidating and routing my gains to either gold or some SCHD / SPY. 

I’d love to hear your thoughts on this. I do think PYPL has $100-$120 in it but I’d like to hold on to my gains.

# [Stock futures are flat after two straight down days for S&P 500, Nasdaq: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/04/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures were flat Thursday as Wall Street looks to regain momentum after a rocky start to September. Key labor market data is also on deck this week.
*****
> Futures for the S&P 500 were up marginally, while Nasdaq 100 futures hovered near the flatline. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 50 points.
*****
> The moves come after the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite each closed lower for the second straight session, dipping 0.16% and 0.30%, respectively. The Dow squeezed out a gain of 38 points, or 0.09%, on Wednesday.
*****
> All three averages are down for the week, with key employment reports looming. On Thursday morning, investors will get to sift through weekly jobless claims data, while the August nonfarm payrolls report is due out Friday.
*****
> The market has appeared to be sensitive to potential growth scares in recent weeks, including Tuesday’s sell-off on the heels of weak manufacturing data. That could put increased importance on the jobless claims data, BMO Wealth Management chief investment officer Yung-Yu Ma said on “Closing Bell.”
*****
> “That’s more of a forward-looking indicator. As long as those stay low — people have jobs, people remain confident in the ability to find jobs or comfortable in the jobs that they have — we think that they will continue to spend. So as long as those numbers stay low, if we get some blips in the overall monthly jobs report that shows weakness on the edges, we’re not quite as concerned,” Ma said.
*****
> The employment data could play a key role in the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision later this month. Ma said he still believes the U.S. economy is on track for a “soft landing” and that the market rally should eventually broaden out. However, he added that there is likely to be continued market turbulence in the near term.
*****
> “We believe in it, we just think it’s going to be on pause for a few months because this high degree of uncertainty we have right now. There’s just too much that needs to resolved over the coming months. … It’s just very hard for the broadening-of-the-market theme to really gather momentum,” Ma said.

2024-08-26 06:44:24,Tesla,TSLA,Morgan Stanley is cutting its position in Tesla stock. Here's why,"It seems that Morgan Stanley has finally seen the writing on the wall.

Morgan Stanley said it is slashing its position in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock, citing a “continued slowdown in the auto industry, intense competition among electric vehicles (EVs) and reduced consumer preferences” for EVs.

TSLA has been a part of Morgan Stanley’s model portfolio since March 2021, with the position increased in both September and December 2022. However, the stock was reduced in November 2023.

Since the last stake boost in December 2022, Tesla has delivered a 15% return, trailing the Russell 1000 Growth Index (RLG) by 46%, Morgan Stanley strategists highlighted.

“While we continue to hold a position in TSLA, due to the optionality of its various nonauto assets, we see an attractive opportunity to reallocate some of the position to other, less-volatile stocks that are not as economically sensitive and may have less pricing pressure,” they wrote.

Despite Tesla’s status as the leading electric vehicle company in the U.S., with potential growth avenues in robotics, AI, and energy storage, the strategists have decided to reduce the position to make room for stocks with higher earnings viability such as Spotify (NYSE:SPOT).

Earlier this week, the European Union announced that it would reduce planned tariffs on Tesla vehicles imported from China, lowering them from 20.8% to 9%. The EU is also cutting planned import duties for several other electric vehicle manufacturers.

These new tariffs will be in addition to the existing 10% duties already imposed by the EU on battery electric vehicle imports.

In June, the EU indicated it would impose higher tariffs on Chinese electric vehicle imports, arguing that these vehicles ""heavily benefit from unfair subsidies"" and present a ""threat of economic injury"" to European EV producers.",161,111,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1f1hou9/morgan_stanley_is_cutting_its_position_in_tesla/

2024-08-02 14:28:23,Tesla,TSLA,"22/yo investing for roughly three years, having regrets about my choices.","Hello stockers. I was doing some reflecting, looking at my portfolio that I have slowly been building since July / Aug of 2021. I have mostly been doing stock picking based on companies I liked, and unfortunately I have come to the realization that I have missed out on quite a bit of gains from not simply investing in VOO or SPY. My total return on three years of investing is 25% (although last week it peaked at 39%, which probably goes to show that I am over exposed), but had I just put my money in VOO in a dollar cost averaging method, I would likely have a much higher return.

Any advice for me? Should I just sell things off and put them in VOO? My current portfolio breakdown looks like this. Of course some bigger losers I have sold off. *$7934 invested, $9950 current.*

2024-08-01 18:13:46,Tesla,TSLA,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

>Federal prosecutors have criminally charged the activist short seller and analyst Andrew Leftwith securities fraud related to allegedly using his public platform to illegally profit to the tune of at least $16 million from manipulating stock market activity contrary to positions he presented to the public from 2018 through 2023.

&#x200B;

>“Left bragged to colleagues that some of these statements \[he made\] were especially effective at inducing retail investors to trade based on his recommendations and said that it was like taking ‘candy from a baby,’ ” the SEC alleged in that complaint.

&#x200B;

>The companies identified in the [criminal indictment](https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/media/1361671/dl?inline) as ones Left allegedly traded on in ways contrary to his public stances on their stock prices included [Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.ABAQ/), [Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA/), the social media company X, formerly known as Twitter, [Meta](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/META/), [Roku](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ROKU/), [Beyond Meat](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BYND/), [American Airlines](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAL/), [Palantir](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/PLTR/), XL Fleet, [Invitae](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVTA/), [General Electric](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GE/), Namaste Technologies, and India Globalization Capital.

&#x200B;

>“In exchange for sharing his planned announcements with the hedge funds in advance of posting them publicly, the hedge funds paid defendant Left a portion of their trading profits,” the indictment says.

&#x200B;

>“By using the Citron Twitter Account to generate ‘catalysts’ — events with the ability to move stock prices — defendant Left profited from his advance knowledge that he was about to trigger such movements in the market.”  After using his influence to manipulate a stock’s price, Left “closed his positions to capitalize on the temporary price movement caused by his public statements,” the indictment alleges.

>If convicted, he would face a maximum possible sentence of 25 years in prison for the securities fraud scheme alone.

2024-07-22 20:52:11,Tesla,TSLA,Berkshire Hathaway cuts stake in China's BYD to below 5%,"Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), opens new tab reduced its stake in BYD (002594.SZ), opens new tab to below 5%, in what could be the final time Berkshire discloses stock sales in China's largest producer of electric vehicles.
Berkshire lowered its stake in BYD's issued H-shares to 4.94% from 5.06% on July 16, according to a Monday filing with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The stake had been 7.02% as recently as June 11.
Hong Kong requires larger shareholders to disclose, opens new tab sales when their resulting stakes fall below whole percentage numbers. Disclosures can stop once ownership stakes fall below 5%.
Berkshire began investing in Shenzhen-based BYD in 2008 when it paid $230 million for about 225 million shares, then equal to a 10% stake.
It began selling BYD shares in August 2022, after the stock price had risen more than 20-fold, and two months after it set a record high.
Charlie Munger, Berkshire's late vice chairman, was the impetus behind the original BYD investment. Berkshire invests mainly in the United States.
BYD was founded by Chinese chemist Wang Chuanfu in 1995 as a maker of rechargeable batteries.
It surpassed billionaire Elon Musk's Tesla (TSLA.O), opens new tab last year as the world's largest electric vehicle maker, though Tesla has since regained the top spot. In the second quarter, BYD sold 426,039 electric vehicles while Tesla sold 443,956.

2024-07-15 13:23:18,Tesla,TSLA,Is PSNY good now?,"I think PSNY is a good buy.

Here is some knowledge for all of the regards who have no idea who PSNY is good luck boy

So PSNY better known as POLESTAR is the EV baby of VOLVO. They got spun off and was basically released from them in early 2024 since Volvo said they were positioned for growth. Okay enough with the fucking history lesson…

The stock has been floating at around $1 USD after being around the $0.70 mark at the end of last month. So they are seeing some positive movement already in the last couple of weeks. This is just due to it being undervalued overall and a correction from what I can tell. 

As of last week they finally broke above there SMA50 and are showing some signs of a recovery. This is good news for a longer look as they should be able to hold at this $1 mark and not need to deal with delisting.

They are expanding into new market and their finances are finally in order. Previously they had some problems with delivering EPS etc but they are now closing the gap on their burn rate and looking towards positivity. 

The company while not selling a large volume of cars is under valued for the number of cars they sell at the current price point. TSLAs price per car is great than a 5X value while PSNY is less than 1/2X that. Okay I know TSLA is awesome so that’s why the price per expect sales is so high… well LCID is at 2 1/2X and they haven’t been doing so hot so once again this company is undervalued for what they are performing.

We saw the markets sell off yesterday due to the CPI news, think we’re going to have a relatively flat day today. Trying to post earlier, if this post gets more traction I'll try to post earlier, otherwise will revert to the regularly scheduled post times.



[TSLA](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d) - We saw TSLA delay their Robotaxi Event from August to October, watching for some form of bounce in the stock. Currently long, but will remain agile (as usual) if we selloff at the open.



[NVDA](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d) - We also saw this turn more strongly than the other Mag7 stocks because of the close to 15% move we saw it make in the past week. No opinion on this yet, but watching for a setup.



[T](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=T&p=d) - Announces massive hack of customer data, includes records of customer calls/texts.



[SNOW](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SNOW&p=d) - AT&T ($T) had their customer data illegaly downloaded from a workspace on a third-party cloud platform (identified as SNOW’s). Might be user error/social engineering (not sure) rather than a cybersecurity issue, so we might see a reversal of this move at the open. However, it should noted that there were no multifactor authentication safeguards in place in previous hacks of SNOW.



[JPM](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=JPM&p=d) - Reports $4.40 vs $4.19 expected EPS. NI at $18B was up 25% from the same period a year ago due to exchange of shares in Visa that provided $8B in gains.

2024-07-11 15:13:46,Tesla,TSLA,Tesla Fantasies and Industry Corruption?,"I was trying to figure out the reasons for the TSLA runup.  Saw many talking/writing about short squeeze, so-called analysts like Ives talking about robotaxi, others talking about energy, etc.   It's all over the place.  All trying to justify the crazy multiple expansion of this stock.  Most are convinced Tesla will achieve L3/L4/L5 autonomous classification to support robotaxi, as it has been sold to us.

ALL of them, I say again, ALL of them ignoring the fact that Tesla cars cannot achieve Level3 certification WITHOUT a backup system, such as LIDAR. Therefore, Tesla will never get L3 certified unless the US state motor vehicle regulators change the laws around this, and I highly doubt it will happen anytime soon. Equally I don't expect Tesla to start adding LIDAR since it would cut into their profit margin.  Assuming that by some miracle they actually achieve L3, L4/L5 is a huge leap forward and required for robotaxi.

I genuinely believe there is corruption that persist here.  Much cheaper to bribe other people (or encourage fan boys) to spread lies throughout the internet about the future of tesla robotaxi fantasy.  I know I sound like a consipracist.  So, someone please explain to me what is wrong with everyone, including financial professionals, promoting this Tesla robotaxi lie?

Historical performance has been poor, they IPO'd way over valued to raise funds, but what they're doing is expensive. It's no news that they're hemorrhaging money, citing a loss of $40,000 per vehicle sold (down from $67,000 last year). But in the last 3 months they've had some very promising announcements.

During the recent investor day webinar they talked about how Gen 1 was all about proof of concept, but now they're moving onto Gen 2 which is about manufacturing efficiency. They detailed how they reduced components, steps and fasteners to decrease production and assembly costs. It all sounds very good. In addition they just entered a deal with VW for $5 Billion and all Rivian is supplying to VW is software. It's a stepped plan, $1B up front and additional investments based on performance.

If they reduce manufacturing costs as they predict, and lower sale price as they promised, I'm thinking this stock could be ripe for big growth. They're the only company competing directly with Tesla, and on the consumer side, it's going well. I doubt we'll ever see a RIVN selling at comparable prices to TSLA, but I could see them over $100 in a few years if they continue to make advancements.

2024-07-08 17:00:51,Tesla,TSLA,How to surpass the fear of selling?,"Long story short: I have some unrealised gains on stocks that I bought time ago (AMAT and ASML).

I was multiple times on the verge of selling (totally or partially) to realise gains that I could invest in another opportunity with better potential. However, every time one of these opportunities came up, I ended up always retracting and not doing so, because I didn’t want to “give-up” to the long-term perspective I committed when I started in this.

Sadly, with opportunities I mean Meta falling like crazy 1.5 years ago for the overreaction to the decrease in user registrations, Nvidia at 200 (before split), or Netflix also dropping to 180 in mid-2022. Recently, I was about to do the same to buy a chunk of TSLA. But fear always gets me.

I know, everything is about risk tolerance. Maybe I am not made for this, who knows. However, I would be happy to know your opinion about this. I really want to take the chance if I believe that is the right choice. Any state of mind that helps you clicking in the sell button? I’m just tired of missing opportunities just for being afraid.

2024-07-02 13:29:33,Tesla,TSLA,"Tesla reports 443,956 deliveries in second quarter, a 4.8% decrease from last year ","Tesla just posted its second-quarter vehicle production and deliveries numbers for 2024.

Here are the key numbers:

Total deliveries Q2 2024: 443,956 vehicles

Total production Q2 2024: 410,831 vehicles

Tesla’s numbers beat Wall Street estimates. Analysts expected Tesla deliveries to hit 439,000 in the three months ending June 30, according to a consensus of estimates compiled by FactSet Street Account. The total number of deliveries in the second quarter was down 4.8% from 466,140 a year earlier.

Troy Teslike, an independent researcher widely followed by Tesla fans, predicted deliveries of 423,000 for the quarter.

Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales disclosed by the electric vehicle maker. Tesla groups deliveries into two categories — Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, and all other vehicles — but doesn’t report numbers for individual models or specific regions.

Tesla’s current lineup includes its popular Model Y crossover utility vehicles, Model 3 sedans and the new Cybertruck pickups, as well as the Model X SUV and flagship Model S sedan.

In April, Tesla reported a drop of 8.5% in first-quarter deliveries to 386,810, the first annual decline since 2020. Weeks later the company reported 13% decline in year-over-year revenue for the quarter, “primarily due to lower average selling price.”

Sluggish sales were in part the result of temporary factory shut downs initiated in response to an alleged arson attack at Tesla’s factory in Germany, as well as shipping delays following Red Sea conflicts, Tesla said.

But the sales drop also correlated with Tesla’s aging lineup of vehicles, increased competition from other EV makers especially in China, and brand erosion that one recent survey attributed partly to CEO Elon Musk’s “antics” and “political rants.”

Tesla shares are down 16% in 2024 even after rallying 6% on Monday.

Tesla has offered a range of discounts and other incentives this year to try spur sales.

In China, Tesla is currently offering a zero-interest loan as an incentive to get customers to buy a Model 3 or Model Y by July 31. According to its 2023 annual filing, Tesla generated about $21.75 billion of its overall revenue from China, representing 22.5% of total sales.

Colin Langan, an analyst at Wells Fargo, issued a report on Monday, saying the firm sees “declining delivery growth driven by lower demand & diminished return on price cuts.” He recommends selling Tesla shares.

Wells Fargo expects automotive gross margins at Tesla, not including environmental credits, to fall given the “likelihood of more price cuts & lower volumes” as the year continues.

Investor focus will now shift to Tesla’s second-quarter earnings report later this month, and a separate marketing event planned for August, when the company intends to reveal its design for a dedicated robotaxi or “CyberCab.”

Production: 410,831 (-14.35% YoY)

Delivery: 443,956 (-4.75% YoY) but beating WS estimates at 438,019

That being said, no growth is ""still"" acceptable? LOL \~ typical TSLA!

*Tesla shares jumped on Tuesday after the company posted second-quarter vehicle production and deliveries numbers that beat analyst expectations.*  
*Analysts expected Tesla deliveries to hit 439,000 in the three months ending June 30, according to a consensus of estimates compiled by FactSet StreetAccount. The total number of deliveries in the second quarter fell 4.8% from 466,140 a year earlier but rose 14.8% from the first quarter.*  
*The stock rose more than 9% Tuesday in midday trading. Before the report, Tesla shares were down 16% in 2024.*

**Tesla's quarterly deliveries fall less than expected; shares rally**

*Tesla on Tuesday reported a smaller-than-expected 5% drop in vehicle deliveries in the second quarter, as the electric carmaker's price cuts and incentives helped mitigate cooling demand.*

*Shares of the world's most valuable automaker rallied more than 10% on Tuesday, hitting the highest level in nearly six months.*

*The higher-than-expected deliveries data ""greatly assuages concerns regarding softening EV demand,"" CFRA Research analyst Garrett Nelson said. ""The stock continues to ride a wave of positive momentum following its annual meeting in mid-June in which shareholders re-approved Musk’s 2018 compensation plan,"" he said, referring to CEO Elon Musk.*

Everything below this line was written before the release of P&D numbers \~

&#x200B;

TSLA is going to release its 2024Q2 P&D numbers in the next couple of hours, WS analysts think that total delivery could reach 438,019 (vs 466,140, i.e. around 6% YoY drop).

In my opinion, 438K is still far too high based on continuous checking shared by a lot of non-WS analysts - which is supported by the data regularly released in Mainland China, Europe and the United States. The educated estimates should be ranging from 415K to 420K, implying at least 9% YoY decline.

Recall in January 2024's investor call that Mr. CEO was saying TSLA is between two major growth waves while no further guidance was provided (very tricky to be honest), does it mean ""low growth"" or actually ""no growth""?

More information will be followed post the release of 2024Q2 numbers ...

*Tesla's June-quarter deliveries likely fell 6%, the first time the top EV maker is set to post two straight quarters of decline, as it deals with stiff competition in China and slow demand due to a lack of affordable new models.*

*The company is expected to deliver 438,019 vehicles for the April to June period, according to an average estimate based on forecasts from 12 analysts polled by LSEG, seven of whom slashed their expectations in the past three months. The EV maker is expected to announce the results on Tuesday.*

*Tesla has hit a speed bump after years of rapid growth that helped make it the world's most valuable automaker. It warned in January that deliveries growth in 2024 would be ""notably lower"" as a boost from months-long price cuts wanes.*

2024-07-01 15:29:27,Tesla,TSLA,"Tesla's Q2 deliveries expected to fall, but could the key figure be energy storage?","Tesla ( TSLA ) announced global vehicle deliveries for the second quarter on Tuesday, with total deliveries expected to fall short of current expectations. However, with demand for electric vehicles slowing in 2024 and the artificial intelligence boom dominating the market, perhaps Tesla's second-quarter energy storage numbers should also be cause for concern. The company deployed a record 4,053 megawatt-hours (MWh) of energy storage capacity in the first quarter. Tesla now offers solar panels and solar rooftops, as well as power walls for energy storage. On the commercial side, Tesla also offers a ""Super Battery Pack."" Tesla's energy business may be ""uniquely positioned to benefit from the accelerating investment in the U.S. power grid driven by the AI boom"" as Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) increases energy demand. Tesla Energy is valued at $36 per share, or about $130 billion. Tesla Energy's revenue will reach about $7 billion this year, up 20% from 2023. Tesla Energy's profit margins will surpass the company's auto margins in 2024. So I think Tesla's energy business should be focused on as well, don't you think?",2,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1dsvu8u/teslas_q2_deliveries_expected_to_fall_but_could/
2024-06-27 12:16:42,Tesla,TSLA,Mastering Long-Term Investments: Combining Technical and Fundamental Analysis,"By Technical or fundamental analysis: which one is better for long-term investing? Myriad investors use one or the other technique on its own seemingly successfully, but using only one presents significant limitations.      

Using a combination of both could be the ultimate winning strategy. Although the topic of technical analysis is controversial among a certain group of Wall Street investors, recent data points toward its importance when investing for the future. 

A study from March 2023 by Fidelity Investments’ Vice President of Advanced Analytics and Insights Jasleen Kaur and a professor at the School of Business Studies in India Khushdeep Dharni looked at two different strategies of investing using advanced mathematics and computer software to mine the data necessary for more profitable trading. 

Computer algorithms examined both technical indicators and fundamental data across over 381 companies, showing that data-mining techniques incorporating elements of both technical and fundamental analysis led to better investment returns than a pure buy-and-hold strategy. 

Sifting through a huge pile of data seems much easier with the rise of faster technology, but the core principles behind the platforms with automated tools have been around for a long time and could still be used by a qualified person to reach the same results.

https://preview.redd.it/m7i4i1d7w39d1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cec9baea1fc05d2a3d391395bc0981ac8dd7987a

Conducting fundamental analysis is crucial when evaluating stocks. One should have a comprehensive understanding of a company’s financial health and performance. The kind of stock to keep for the next 10 or 20 years is the second important component — will the company or commodity exist in the future, or is it a dying business that’ll be outlawed eventually? Fundamental analysis is used in finance to evaluate the intrinsic value or real worth of a security as well as entire sectors and markets.

There’s widespread agreement that assessing investments through fundamental analysis is necessary for long term investing. Although important, on its own it could prove to be limiting. For example, if one evaluates the stock and does not look at the current chart and volume movement, one could buy an overpriced stock right before the price is set to crash.

The second step, which is also of significance, involves conducting technical analysis. Unlike fundamental analysis, which focuses on the intrinsic value of an asset, the technical analysis examines the volume and price of shares over time. If used in isolation, one could buy a stock of a company that is about to go under and lose all the investment. Meanwhile, the data shows that technical analysis is just as important.

While the United States and India have very different markets, markets around the world are similar in terms of behavioral psychology and the research findings are true for investors around the globe in many ways.

Overall, it’s as hard to predict where the market will turn next as it is to predict the future. Whether one is seeking to improve their lifestyle or prepare for retirement, the data is important to consider. Investing is risky. The more confluence one could find pointing toward a similar direction, the better.

It’s important to use both techniques in investing and not to be susceptible to impulse investing or simply trusting someone’s piece of advice. Diligent research is paramount — looking for and evaluating the newest research is crucial.",38,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1dppvgp/mastering_longterm_investments_combining/
2024-06-25 20:19:39,Tesla,TSLA,At what point do you cut your losses?,"I’m new to investing. Been doing it about two months and overall have better returns than just leaving the money in a high yield savings account.

One of the first trades I did was buying TSLA at about 170. It ended up dropping to 165 or so and I sold to prevent losses. It dropped to the 140s but obviously now it is in the 180s. I accepted a loss when holding for not even that much longer would have made decent profit.

After I learned a lesson about patience there, I’ve been trying to hold, but a few choices I’ve made don’t show signs of rebounding (SEDG is down 20% today and has been decreasing pretty steadily since I bought in).

I’m still undecided if I’d like to cut my losses and try to invest in something that will give more returns in the meantime, or if I hope that the solar sector has a strong rebound in the (very) long term and just continue to hold.

For the week of June 17-23, Tesla's insurance registrations in China totaled 17,400 vehicles, up 49 percent from 11,700 in the previous week. According to local reports, vehicle registrations in China tend to be slow at the beginning of the month and pick up at the end.



With just one week left in the second quarter, Tesla China insurance registrations are up about 14 percent from the seasonally slower first quarter, but down about 7 percent from the same period in 2023.



Tesla's May deliveries in China were 72,573 units, down 6.6 percent from a year ago and up 16.7 percent from April. The U.S. electric car company sold 55,215 vehicles in China in May, up 30 percent from May 2023, according to data released by the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA).

Thats why i find it ironic his stock is the last to rally and it should be the mother of all come backs.

List of things going for TSLA into the second half of the year.

-pay package approved, now incorporated in TX, a massive hurdle out of the way

-Optimus robot. Wouldn't be surprised if there was a Iron man suit in the works (probably a top secret project?)

-License approved to test FSD is China

-FSD 12.4.1 release soon.

-Robo taxi announcement less than two month away(August 8th). RIP $Uber

-Model 3 Long Range now qualifies for the $7,500 tax credit. This will boost $ales.

-GM, Toyota, Honda and Ford cutting their production on EV's gives Telsa the opportunity to take more market share. More Tesla's on the road? More Robo taxi'$ to operate. More people using robo taxi, no need to buy a car from GM or Ford or Toyota.

-Master Plan Part 4 (Release date TBD)

-New products in the pipeline. They will certainly bring back the $25K car.

-Europe imposed a massive tarriff on Chinese made EV's. Good for Telsa.

-USA tariff on Chinese cars? 100%!!! , no competition from china here.

-Expansion in India is certain, just a matter of when.

The big short: Tesla is one of the most shorted stock in the market(Dollar Volume Sold Short$18.04 billion) with 1.1 days to cover. Tesla has been know to have massive +$30-$40 days, the faster shorts cover the faster we go to $280, my PT.

TSLA reminds me of Apple a few months ago trading at low $170's with not much excitement, now its near $220.

I have TSLA $205 call for July 26, i fully expect TSLA to reach the moon before the Robo taxi release. The time may be running out to get cheap calls.

Lastly the debate is over, Telsa is a Tech company, its a conglomerate like GE once was.",0,91,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1dich6k/tsla_might_be_the_most_undervalued_ai_play_in_the/

2024-06-02 21:14:54,Tesla,TSLA,Hold TSLA or sell and reinvest into ETFs?,"Hi all! I’m kind of stuck in a dilemma of whether I should hold Tesla stock and hope that it will return to my purchase price, or sell all and reinvest into ETFs. I don’t really have any goals in the long term or short term so I don’t really mind individual stocks or ETFs. I just hate seeing a downward trend for the past year and not sure if my money would be better in the SP500. I also don’t want to preemptively sell and have it skyrocket past my purchase price. All opinions would be appreciated!

For context:

Shares: 53
Initial purchase price: $279.41
Current price: $177.50

Would probably invest into VOO, VTI, VXUS if I were to reinvest into ETFs.

2024-05-31 13:52:58,Tesla,TSLA,Top proxy advisor ISS recommends against Elon Musk's $56 billion Tesla pay package ,"Top proxy advisor Institutional Shareholder Services on Friday recommended Tesla shareholders vote against the re-approval of CEO Elon Musk’s $56 billion pay package and withhold their support from the re-election of News Corp. scion James Murdoch to the automaker’s board.

Tesla’s shareholder meeting is on June 13.

The report, a copy of which was obtained by CNBC, comes after the other influential proxy advisor service, Glass Lewis, also recommended shareholders vote against Musk’s pay package. Tesla’s board is seeking shareholder approval to reinstate Musk’s pay after a Delaware court voided the package earlier this year.

ISS said “cautionary” shareholder support was merited for Tesla’s plans to reincorporate out of Delaware and into Texas, although the proxy advisor also warned that there are concerns over how Tesla’s board decided to reincorporate and over the “unknown” nature of Texas’s business law framework.

The proxy advisor recommended support for some shareholder proposals that Tesla management opposes, including one that would declassify Tesla’s board. A classified or staggered board is considered by some advisors to be an effective defense against a takeover bid.

“At a mega-cap company like Tesla, what is perhaps even more relevant to shareholders is that a staggered board can hinder shareholders from holding directors accountable for poor responsiveness,” ISS said of its support for the declassification proposal.

Pay package push

Tesla has been courting shareholder support in both time-tested and novel ways. The company engaged communications firm FGS Global and proxy solicitor Innisfree M&A to win votes, and has bolstered apparent grassroots support from its large network of social-media influencers. The company also launched a website, VoteTesla.com, and has offered shareholders the chance to win a tour of Tesla’s Gigafactory facility in Austin.

Tesla seeks shareholder approval for Musk’s payday and concurrently to reincorporate out of Delaware and into Texas. The company has characterized the Delaware chancery court ruling that overturned Musk’s stock package as unfriendly to shareholders, noting the value that Musk has created for investors.

“Over the last several years it has become clear that Delaware is no longer the right jurisdiction for us,” Tesla chair Robyn Denholm said in a letter to shareholders earlier this week.

Tesla has adopted tactics other companies have used in contested shareholder meetings, whipping votes and launching a concerted public-relations effort to win support. While Tesla is not facing any sort of meaningful organized opposition to its efforts to reincorporate or re-approve Elon’s pay package, some shareholders have come out against it. Billionaire Leo KoGuan has repeatedly said he will vote against the package. KoGuan says he owns around 0.75% of Tesla shares, worth around $4.9 billion.

Proxy advisor pull

ISS and its smaller peer Glass Lewis are an important factor in how shareholders decide to cast their votes at annual elections. Their recommendations are closely watched in contested situations but are not definitive calls. Still, they have developed a reputation for being important bellwethers and seek to advocate for shareholders.

They’ve also been the direct target of Musk’s ire. Earlier this year on an earnings call, he compared ISS to the terrorist organization ISIL, also known as ISIS. Musk also said they “effectively control the stock market” on X in 2023, saying they had outsize influence over so-called “passive” or institutional shareholders.

Institutional shareholders like BlackRock and Vanguard, however, do not always vote with ISS recommendations. While voting decisions are generally not disclosed until well after a shareholder meeting, those institutional shareholders have due diligence teams that help them decide how to cast the millions of shares they manage on behalf of their investors.

ISS in its report said its prior concerns over the pay package, which dates back to 2018, had not been mitigated and that it “remains excessive,” noting that “the board has effectively only offered shareholders an ‘all or nothing’ option in this vote.”

The proxy advisor alluded to Musk’s myriad other business ventures such as social media platform X, his AI startup xAI and SpaceX, as another reason why Tesla shareholders should not support the pay package.

“The grant, in many ways, failed to achieve the board’s other original objectives of focusing CEO Musk on the interests of Tesla shareholders, as opposed to other business endeavors, and aligning his financial interests more closely with those of Tesla stockholders,” ISS said.

Or ""I knew <insert Mag 7 stock> was a screaming buy at $x and bought some there.""

Fact is, if you have a 401k that invests in an S&P index fund, or if you DCA into VOO or whatever other S&P fund you're into, then Mag 7 is already your primary holding. And I would guess one or both of those scenarios cover 95% of the people who post here.

""I own Mag 7"" comments sound as bizarre as ""I breathe air"" or ""I drink water"". We all do. Nothing special about it. The exception is if you own a ridiculous amount, like people who have $1M+ of NVDA now that they first started buying in 2011. Also, if anyone feels bad they didn't buy META at $100 or NVDA at the end of 2023, they shouldn't because they actually did buy there if they were actively contributing to their 401k or Roth.",0,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1cz7qqd/why_do_people_feel_the_need_to_disclose_they_hold/

BYD (HKG: 1211, OTCMKTS: BYDDY) continued to dominate China's new energy vehicle (NEV) market in April, with Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) dropping in its ranking.

BYD's retail sales of passenger NEVs in China totaled 254,131 units in April, giving it the No. 1 spot in the NEV market with a 37.5 percent share, according to a ranking released today by the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA).

The NEV maker was the only one with a share of more than 30 percent, with retail sales up 31.1 percent year-on-year.

BYD released figures earlier this month showing it sold 313,245 NEVs in April, up 48.96 percent from a year earlier and up 3.57 percent from March. The figures are wholesale sales and include both passenger cars and commercial vehicles.

China's passenger NEVs sold 674,000 units at retail in April, up 28.3 percent from a year ago but down 5.7 percent from March, CPCA data released yesterday showed.

Tesla's retail sales in China in April were 31,421 units, down 21.4 percent from a year ago, and ranked No. 5 with a 4.6 percent share.

In the CPCA's March retail sales rankings of NEVs released last month, Tesla was No. 2 with an 8.8 percent share, behind BYD's 36.6 percent.

It's worth noting that in China, NEVs include battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and fuel-cell vehicles. BYD produces PHEVs and BEVs, while Tesla only produces BEVs.

Tesla sold 62,167 China-made vehicles in April, including 30,746 exported, according to CPCA data released yesterday.

Tesla has a factory in Shanghai that produces the Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover, both for deliveries to local customers and as an export hub for it.

Tesla's pattern is to produce cars for export in the first half of the quarter and for the local market in the second half, it previously said.

Geely's retail sales of NEVs in April were up 76.3 percent at 49,155 units, placing it at No. 2 with a 7.3 percent share.

Changan Automobile's NEV retail sales in April were up 119 percent to 40,507 units, placing it 3rd with a 6 percent share.

In the January-April period, BYD's NEV retail sales were 840,137 units, up 19.6 percent year-on-year, and ranked No. 1 with a 34.3 percent share.

FAW-Volkswagen sold 119,032 units at retail in April, down 15.6 percent year-on-year, and ranked No. 2 with a 7.8 percent share.

Geely had retail sales of 115,723 units in April, up 31.2 percent year-on-year, to take 3rd place with a 7.6 percent share.

In the January-April period, BYD was No. 1 in China's passenger car market with a 13.2 percent share, FAW-Volkswagen was No. 2 with an 8.1 percent share and Geely was No. 3 with a 7.9 percent share.

2024-05-10 17:40:54,Tesla,TSLA,"Elon Musk backtracks on Supercharger network halt, says more chargers coming","Last week Tesla's CEO fired nearly the entire 500-member Supercharger team. Tesla's partners are demanding answers, with competitors waiting in the wings.

Leave it to Tesla CEO Elon Musk to add more chaos to a situation that he ostensibly created in the first place.

In a tweet on X early Friday morning, Musk addressed concerns many have had over his recent move to shrink down Tesla’s (TSLA) Supercharger team.

“Just to reiterate: Tesla will spend well over $500M expanding our Supercharger network to create thousands of NEW chargers this year,” Musk wrote. “That’s just on new sites and expansions, not counting operations costs, which are much higher.”

Shortly thereafter, Musk also started a “Supercharger Community” on X, where members can discuss and share stories on the topic.

Whether Musk’s proclamation that Tesla is still heavily investing in the Supercharger is accurate or not is another story, but the industry, investors, and EV owners are seeking clarity and demanding answers.

Last week Musk and Tesla laid off nearly the entire Supercharger organization, which was responsible for the build-out of its best-in-class charging network. In the aftermath of the initial layoffs, Musk addressed the Supercharger news on X, stating that the network will grow at “a slower pace” for new locations.

Automakers like GM, Ford, Kia, Polestar, Stellantis, Honda, and others had signed up to access the Supercharger network, and incorporate Tesla’s NACS plug inlet in their future vehicles, under the promise that the Supercharger network would continue to grow at a steady pace.

Tesla was likely getting an earful from its NACS partners, questioning what they were getting exactly after signing deals to access the Supercharger network.

In addition, contractors and others working with Tesla on existing Supercharger projects were getting their emails bounced back with no feedback on what to do next. Tesla also apparently backed out of leases at four upcoming Supercharger sites in New York, per EV blog Electrek.

Charging network provider EVgo told Yahoo Finance that it was “actively engaged” in the development of the NACS network and was adding more locations to take advantage of Tesla’s move to backtrack its expansion.

EVgo competitor Blink Charging is also poised to move on the opportunity, claiming potential Supercharger customers contacted Blink about future orders in the wake of Tesla’s move.

Even oil and gas stalwarts like BP are moving in on Tesla. With its BP Pulse charging network, the company said it “is aggressively looking to acquire real estate to scale our network, which is a heightened focus following the recent Tesla announcement.”

The company’s top executive is even telling Tesla’s jilted partners to give him a ring.

“If there are stranded real estate partners who are looking for someone to call, they should feel free to pick up the phone and call me or look me up on LinkedIn,” BP Pulse Americas CEO Sujay Sharma told Bloomberg.

&#x200B;

*U.S. auto safety investigators are seeking detailed answers and documents from Tesla in a probe into the automaker's December recall of more than 2 million vehicles to install new Autopilot safeguards.*

*The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said last month it was investigating after receiving reports of 20 crashes involving vehicles that had the Autopilot software updates installed under Tesla's recall. The agency's letter said it had identified ""several concerns"", regarding the recall.*

*Tesla said in December its largest-ever recall covering 2.03 million U.S. vehicles - or nearly all of its vehicles on U.S. roads - was to better ensure drivers pay attention when using its advanced driver assistance system.*

*The NHTSA recall investigation covers models Y, X, S, 3 and Cybertruck vehicles in the U.S. equipped with Autopilot produced between the 2012 and 2024 model years.*

*Tesla, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment, has said repeatedly that Autopilot does not make vehicles self-driving and is intended for use with a fully attentive driver who is prepared to take over and has hands on the steering wheel.*

*NHTSA said it had sent Tesla an information request letter, which was made public on Tuesday, seeking details of the recall and documents by July 1.*

*NHTSA wants comparative data from Tesla on the performance of vehicles after receiving the recall including the number of hands on wheel warnings issued.*

*The agency said it had concerns after those 20 crashes as well as results from preliminary NHTSA tests of updated vehicles following Tesla's five-part recall remedy.*

*One issue under investigation is Tesla's recall allows drivers to set how they activate Autopilot by either allowing a single-pull or double-pull of the drive stalk.*

*NHTSA's letter said the single-pull activation of Autopilot ""is not the default setting on vehicles that received the remedy in the field"" and testing ""showed it was possible to make this change while driving.""*

*Tesla has also made additional updates to reduce crashes including high speed captive turn lane collisions that are not part of the recall.*

*NHTSA said it ""will assess the timing and driving factors behind these updates, their impacts on subject vehicle field performance, and Tesla’s basis for not including them"".*

*Last month, NHTSA said it found evidence that ""Tesla’s weak driver engagement system was not appropriate for Autopilot’s permissive operating capabilities"" and that this results in a ""critical safety gap.""*

*NHTSA said during its Autopilot safety probe launched in August 2021 that it had identified at least 13 Tesla crashes involving at least one death and many more involving serious injuries in which ""foreseeable driver misuse of the system played an apparent role.""*

*NHTSA noted Tesla's December recall ""allows a driver to readily reverse"" the software update.*

**Elon Musk proposed to launch robotaxis in China during April visit, state media report says**

&#x200B;

*Elon Musk proposed testing Tesla's advanced driver-assistance package in China by deploying it in robotaxis, during his recent visit to the country, the state-backed China Daily newspaper reported on Wednesday, citing sources.*

*Chinese officials told the Tesla CEO that China ""welcomes Tesla to do some robotaxi tests in the country"" and hopes it can ""set a good example"", the newspaper quoted the sources as saying.*

*However, Chinese authorities did not immediately approve its widespread use of Full Self-Driving (FSD) functions, the newspaper added.*

*Before the full rollout of its FSD functions, Tesla still needs to get approval to collect and transfer data that Tesla's cars need to train its driver-assistance features. The newspaper added that this issue wasn't discussed in detail during Musk's visit.*

*A person briefed on the matter told Reuters that Tesla is seeking to apply to launch the robotaxi tests in Shanghai, where the company's largest factory globally is located.*

*Tesla and the Shanghai city government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.*

*The China Daily report comes shortly after Tesla CEO Elon Musk made a whirlwind weekend trip to Beijing late last month, where he met Chinese Premier Li Qiang.*

*Musk on the trip intended to discuss the rollout of FSD and whether Tesla could secure government approvals to transfer data overseas that could prove pivotal in its development of autonomous vehicles, Reuters previously reported.*

*FSD is the most autonomous version of Autopilot software and was rolled out in 2020. Its features include self-parking, auto lane changes and traffic navigation.*

*Among the wins during Musk's trip, which was first reported by Reuters, was a key endorsement from a top Chinese auto association that said Tesla's Model 3 and Y cars were compliant with data-security regulations. That would enable local governments to allow Tesla cars into parts of China they were previously barred from, Chinese media reported, citing a statement from Tesla.*

*Tesla has also reached an agreement with Baidu to use the Chinese tech giant's mapping license for data collection on China's public roads, according to two people who at the time described that as a step toward FSD rollout in China.*

*The China Daily newspaper, however, citing a source close to Baidu, said that the deal only meant that the accuracy of Baidu's maps provided to Tesla would be improved and that it had no direct relation with FSD.*

*Baidu did not immediately respond to a request for comment.*

*Musk has abandoned a longstanding goal for Tesla to make affordable electric cars for the masses and is looking to focus on autonomous driving software, robotaxis and its humanoid robot Optimus.*

*Last month, the company mentioned a ""purpose-built robotaxi product"" that it planned to build with a ""revolutionary"" manufacturing process, without offering a timeline for its release.*

*China has been at the forefront in the development of self-driving cars, and companies such as Baidu and Toyota-backed Pony.ai have launched robotaxi services in limited test zones in several cities.*

[https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-autopilot-probe-us-prosecutors-focus-securities-wire-fraud-2024-05-08](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-autopilot-probe-us-prosecutors-focus-securities-wire-fraud-2024-05-08)

&#x200B;

*U.S. prosecutors are examining whether Tesla committed securities or wire fraud by misleading investors and consumers about its electric vehicles’ self-driving capabilities, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.*

*Tesla’s Autopilot and Full Self-Driving systems assist with steering, braking and lane changes - but are not fully autonomous. While Tesla has warned drivers to stay ready to take over driving, the Justice Department is examining other statements by Tesla and Chief Executive Elon Musk suggesting its cars can drive themselves.*

*U.S. regulators have separately investigated hundreds of crashes, including fatal ones, that have occurred in Teslas with Autopilot engaged, resulting in a mass recall by the automaker.*

*Reuters exclusively reported the U.S. criminal investigation into Tesla in October 2022, and is now the first to report the specific criminal liability federal prosecutors are examining.*

*Investigators are exploring whether Tesla committed wire fraud, which involves deception in interstate communications, by misleading consumers about its driver-assistance systems, the sources said. They are also examining whether Tesla committed securities fraud by deceiving investors, two of the sources said.*

*The Securities and Exchange Commission is also investigating Tesla’s representations about driver-assistance systems to investors, one of the people said. The SEC declined to comment.*

*Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. Last October, it disclosed in a filing that the Justice Department had asked the company for information about Autopilot and Full Self-Driving.*

*The Justice Department declined to comment.*

*The probe, which is not evidence of wrongdoing, could result in criminal charges, civil sanctions, or no action. Prosecutors are far from deciding how to proceed, one of the sources said, in part because they are sifting through voluminous documents Tesla provided in response to subpoenas.*

*Reuters could not determine the specific statements prosecutors are reviewing as potentially illegal. Musk has aggressively touted the prowess of Tesla’s driver-assistance technology for nearly a decade.*

*Tesla videos demonstrating the technology that remain archived on its website say: “The person in the driver’s seat is only there for legal reasons. He is not doing anything. The car is driving itself.”*

*A Tesla engineer testified in 2022 in a lawsuit over a fatal crash involving Autopilot that one of the videos, posted in October 2016, intended to show the technology’s potential and did not accurately portray its capabilities at the time. Musk nevertheless posted the video on social media, writing: “Tesla drives itself (no human input at all) thru urban streets to highway streets, then finds a parking spot.”*

*In a conference call with reporters in 2016, Musk described Autopilot as “probably better” than a human driver. During an October 2022 call, Musk addressed a forthcoming FSD upgrade he said would allow customers to travel “to your work, your friend’s house, to the grocery store without you touching the wheel.”*

*Musk is increasingly focused on self-driving technology as Tesla's car sales and profit slump. Tesla recently slashed costs through mass layoffs and shelved plans for a long-awaited $25,000 model that had been expected to drive sales growth.*

*“Going balls to the wall for autonomy is a blindingly obvious move,” the billionaire executive posted on his social-media platform X in mid-April. Tesla shares, down more than 28% so far this year, surged in late April when Musk visited China and made progress toward approvals to sell FSD there.*

*Musk has repeatedly promised self-driving Teslas for about a decade. ""Mere failure to realize a long-term, aspirational goal is not fraud,"" Tesla lawyers said in a 2022 court filing.*

*LEGAL CHALLENGES*

*Prosecutors scrutinizing Tesla’s autonomous-car claims are proceeding with caution, recognizing the legal hurdles they face, the people familiar with the inquiry said.*

*They will need to demonstrate that Tesla’s claims crossed a line from legal salesmanship to material and knowingly false statements that unlawfully harmed consumers or investors, three legal experts uninvolved in the probe told Reuters.*

*U.S. courts previously have ruled that “puffery” or “corporate optimism” regarding product claims do not amount to fraud. In 2008, a federal appeals court ruled that statements of corporate optimism alone do not demonstrate that a company official intentionally misled investors.*

*Justice Department officials will likely seek internal Tesla communications as evidence that Musk or others knew they were making false statements, said Daniel Richman, a Columbia Law School professor and former federal prosecutor. That is a challenge, Richman said, but the safety risk involved in overselling self-driving systems also “speaks to the seriousness with which prosecutors, a judge and jury would take the statements.”*

*FATAL CRASHES*

*Tesla’s claims about Autopilot and FSD have also drawn scrutiny in regulatory investigations and lawsuits.*

*Safety regulators and courts have raised concerns in recent months that corporate messaging about the technology - including the brand names Autopilot and Full Self-Driving - have imbued customers with a false sense of security.*

*In April, the Washington State Patrol arrested a man on suspicion of vehicular homicide after his Tesla, with Autopilot engaged, struck and killed a motorcyclist while the driver looked at his phone, police records show. In a probable-cause statement, a trooper cited the driver’s “admitted inattention to driving, while on autopilot mode ... putting trust in the machine to drive for him.”*

*In Washington state, a driver remains ""responsible for the safe and legal operation of that vehicle"" regardless of its technological capabilities, a state patrol spokesperson told Reuters.*

*The same month, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration launched an investigation into whether a Tesla recall of more than 2 million vehicles in December adequately addressed safety issues with Autopilot.*

*NHTSA declined to comment.*

*The recall followed a long-running probe opened by regulators after cars with Autopilot engaged repeatedly crashed into vehicles at first-responder emergency scenes. Regulators subsequently examined hundreds of crashes where Autopilot was engaged and identified 14 deaths and 54 injuries.*

*Tesla disputed NHTSA's findings but agreed to the recall, which employed over-the-air software updates intended to alert inattentive drivers.*

*The NHTSA investigation found “a critical safety gap between drivers’ expectations” of Tesla’s technology “and the system’s true capabilities,” according to agency records. “This gap led to foreseeable misuse and avoidable crashes.”*",45,53,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1cn05bd/tsla_robotaxi_in_mainland_china_instead_of_the/

2024-04-29 11:41:00,Tesla,TSLA,Tesla jumps 10% in premarket trade after passing key hurdle to roll out full self-driving in China,"Shares of Tesla rose sharply in U.S. premarket trading on Monday after the electric car maker passes a significant milestone to roll out its full self-driving technology in China.

The company’s share price spiked more than 10% just after 7:30 a.m. ET, as investors reacted to news surrounding Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s visit to China.

Tesla on Sunday said that local Chinese authorities removed restrictions on its cars after passing the country’s data security requirements.

The move raised expectations that Tesla’s driver-assistance software Full Self Driving (FSD) would soon be available in the country, which is the largest market for electric vehicles.

While Tesla’s electric cars are some of the most popular vehicles in China, they have reportedly been banned from some government-related properties due to data security concerns.

Separately, the Biden administration earlier this year announced a probe into whether imported cars from China pose national security risks due to their ability to potentially collect sensitive data.

FSD is an upgrade to Tesla’s Autopilot driver assistant. Tesla has offered its FSD technology in China for years, but with a restricted feature set that limits it to operations, such as automated lane changing.

Data security concerns have been a key obstacle preventing Tesla from achieving a full rollout of the system in China.

Tesla also reportedly scored a deal with Baidu that would give Musk’s firm access to the Chinese internet giant’s mapping and navigation technology for Tesla’s FSD feature.

The agreement would allow Tesla to tap into Baidu’s mapping service license, which is a requirement for intelligence driving systems to operate on public roads in China, Reuters reported, citing two anonymous sources familiar with the matter.

CNBC was unable to independently verify the report. Tesla and Baidu were not immediately available for comment.

With the license, which foreign companies can only clinch in partnership with local Chinese firms, Tesla will be allowed to legally operate FSD on Chinese roads, and its fleets will be able to gather data about traffic, road signs and routes.

The breakthrough for Tesla toward bringing its FSD self-driving technology to China marks a key win for the firm at a time when it is facing hefty competition in the Chinese market. Local rivals such as Warren Buffett-backed electric vehicle maker BYD, Nio, and Xpeng have ramped up their competition with Tesla in recent years.

BYD was temporarily the largest electric vehicle maker globally, producing more than 3 million new energy vehicles in 2023. The firm recently lost its crown as world’s largest EV maker, after a 43% plunge in sales in the first quarter.

2024-04-24 21:15:22,Tesla,TSLA,"Bull arguments about TSLA's data advantage for autonomous, is overblown","Every bull case you will hear about why tesla is the only company ripe for FSD, you will hear one thing the most.  ""but ....MILLIONS OF MILES ON TESLA WORLDWIDE"". Just listened to Cathy Wood's latest interview, and this was her whole argument for buying more and more TSLA

This is complete BS argument, and for these people I have only one thing to say. Google was and is the king in Data, yet we have ChatGPT and Anthropics took them by surprised. They have fraction of data that google has, yet they are far better LLM model than Gemini. It clearly isn't about quantity of data, more so on quality and how  it is used to train your model.

Same thing for selfdriving, we literally have Waymo running since 2019, and now expanding to even more cities but people refuse to acknowledge. Tesla has no lead in AI, not in software or hardware. if you listened to TSLA's latest earning call, there was also no mention of dojo, and instead they kept bringing up about buying NVDA H100 to build super computer. This throws out any vertical integration argument as well.

I know people still like to drink Musk coolaid but this is not going to end well. And before you think I am one sour grape because the stock went up 12%, do check my comment history. I insisted in buying calls for yesterday's earning. But that doesn't change the fact, that tesla is going to be a dead money for a while. It IS a well run car company, with no debt and state of art manufacturing. Their only MOAT is the tesla's supercharger network. It should get higher multiple than traditional car companies no doubt.

2024-04-24 16:58:45,Tesla,TSLA,INTC vs TSLA - Trying to understand market sentiment.,"Forgive my naive question but I'm really trying to wrap my head around these two stocks (stockholder in both).  
  
INTC - Semiconductor manufacturing powerhouse. Still has a majority in data center and pc CPU space. I do agree that they fell behind TSMC and Samsung in terms of process leadership and don't have a serious product offering in the GPU space that can take on Nvidia H100 (Gaudi 3 seems like a good competitor). And Pat Gelsinger is trying hard to bring it back on track. They have 18A process node on track to hit HVM production in 2025(?), US government is funding their fab expansion plans, Foundry is slowly winning customer, and for the next few years, compute is the new oil. Everything seems to be inline for INTC to go up like AMD and NVDA. But no, it always drops.  
  
TSLA - Eccentric owner who is more interested in peddling conspiracy theories on X that he bought on a whim. FSD was a long lost pipe dream, which never seems to be working fine , and current version has its own kinks. EV is becoming an extremely competitive market everyday with new entrants and an ongoing price war. Cybertruck was late by 2-3(?) years and has. IDK if Roadster will ever happen in this decade, Tesla Semi is another thing which seemed nice on paper but idk if it's ever really gonna happen. News reports claimed that Musk cancelled Model2. But again claims TSLA is gonna make a cheaper model ( which would probably cannibalize Model 3 and Model Y sales; and lets be honest - no one knows if and when that's actually coming on the roads).  
  
Can anyone explain why is the market so bullish about TSLA even after reporting lower EPS, 9% drop in revenue, and is ready to eat his words about the cheaper model like its God's truth itself, while INTC drops like a rock on the first opportunity, even though Semiconductors are the bedrock of AI and EV growth.",93,100,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1cc3dtf/intc_vs_tsla_trying_to_understand_market_sentiment/

2024-04-19 11:07:59,Tesla,TSLA,"Tesla to recall 3,878 Cybertrucks over faulty accelerator pedal, NHTSA says","April 19 (Reuters) - Tesla [(TSLA.O), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/TSLA.O) is recalling 3,878 Cybertrucks to fix an accelerator pedal pad that could come loose and get lodged in the interior trim, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said on Friday.

A trapped accelerator pedal could cause the vehicle to accelerate unintentionally, increasing the risk of a crash, the auto safety regulator said in a [notice, opens new tab](https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2024/RCAK-24V276-5059.pdf).

Tesla started deliveries of its Cybertruck electric pickup truck late last year, after a two-year delay due to production problems and battery-supply constraints.

The EV maker will replace or repair the accelerator pedal assembly at no charge and owners will be notified through letters mailed to them in June, the NHTSA said.

In the first quarter of 2024 Tesla had three recalls affecting about 2.4 million vehicles, according to a report by recall management firm BizzyCar.

However, most issues related to Tesla recalls are usually resolved through over-the-air software updates.

In February, Tesla [recalled](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-recall-over-2-mln-vehicles-us-nhtsa-2024-02-02/) about 2.2 million vehicles in the United States due to an incorrect font size on warning lights and U.S. safety regulators [upgraded their probe](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-recall-over-2-mln-vehicles-us-nhtsa-2024-02-02/) into the company's vehicles over power steering loss to the status of an engineering analysis.

2024-04-17 14:41:07,Tesla,TSLA,TSLA top or bottom?,"TSLA top or bottom? Without really trying I saw 35 negative TSLA posts in an hour  on Twitter including a hilarious meme or two of Elon and a hippo dropping a deuce on TSLA shareholders.  Some of the best below.

$TSLA had a market cap of $498.8B. For FYE 2023, operating cashflows were $13,256m and capital expenditures were $8,899m. This leaves $4,357m of surplus cashflow.  If all were paid as a dividend, in 116 years your capital would be returned.

""Returning To Petrol"": Volkswagen EV Sales Plunge 25% In Europe

People need to hear that there has never been a better time to short Tesla. Delivery disaster. Price cuts. FSD pricing slashed. Energy deployments halved. Inventory piling up Stock priced at 60X P/E on declining earnings. Auto companies with stable earnings and paying a dividend trade at 5-10X P/E. A reasonable 20/PE at $2.5 EPE gets us to $50.

Tesla has some old inventory at their Orland Park IL service center, some dating back to January. No wonder why Tesla is announcing layoffs.

JPMORGAN: “.. the sweeping $TSLA layoffs announced yesterday, amounting to a reduction in crewed production capacity, should now leave no doubt that the decline in deliveries has been a function of lower demand and not supply. “.. has far reaching implications for the hypergrowth narrative still embedded in Tesla’s share price, suggesting material downside risk for the stock. .. we estimate revenue may decline -13% y/y in the coming quarter.” Reiterate Underweight, $115 target

$TSLA $144 now appears inevitable. It either holds there or $102 is tested next.

The EV market is in trouble: The latest sign is Tesla’s layoffs

Oh noes! $TSLA 6,000 new vehicle insurance registrations in China last week! So sad..

Weekly insured sales data from  shows that $TSLA only sold 6,000 vehicles last week. This is down 52% YoY & the same level of volumes as small local EV makers like $LI & Aito. Quarter-to-date, Tesla's local  sales are 7,907 vehicles, down 59% YoY from 19,473 in 2023.

Oddly no one on the Tesla BOD has resigned.  Of course they are ultimately responsible for the losses at tesla. They are an illegal BOD according to the rules of the u/NasdaqExchange and has been deemed as much by Delaware Courts. They must be removed! $TSLA

Tesla is blackberry, the upstart independent that had the lead and blew it.

$TSLA Cybertruck owners ..do NOT wash your car in sunlight anddo NOT tell Tesla SCs that you drove it through a car wash (like this guy) even if you turned on Car Wash Mode. They will void your warranty.

Tesla announces new sub $20,000 Tesla Model! A 1 year old $60,000 Tesla! ""I'm a skeptic of u/elonmusk's management style at this point,"" says u/GerberKawasaki as Tesla delays Cybertruck deliveries. ""Ever since he left Tesla and bought Twitter, basically nobody has been running the ship."" $TSLA

How bad is u/CathieDWood ? Over the last 5 years she has now returned -7% in $ARKK she trails the $SPX by 88% and $COMP by 107% respectively. Maybe think twice about shoving her face on TV again.

2024-04-04 02:33:03,Tesla,TSLA,"Tesla (TSLA) PT Lowered to $115 at JPMorgan, 'We are slashing our estimates and price target'","
On Wednesday, JPMorgan revised its price target for Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares, reducing it to $115 from the previous $130 while maintaining an Underweight rating. The adjustment follows Tesla's first-quarter delivery numbers, which significantly fell short of both JPMorgan's and consensus expectations.

Analysts at JPMorgan expressed concern that the disappointing delivery figures might impact investor confidence in Tesla's long-term growth prospects, which is vital for upholding the stock's high valuation multiple.

Tesla's vehicle sales for the first quarter of 2024 showed a year-over-year decline of 9%, contrasting with the Bloomberg consensus estimate which anticipated a growth of 6%, and the company-compiled consensus which expected a 5% increase. This miss represents the largest discrepancy from analyst estimates on record for the electric vehicle maker.

Previously, analysts projected that Tesla would sell 626,000 vehicles in the first quarter, marking a 48% year-over-year growth, but the actual sales reported were only 387,000 vehicles, which is 38% below the peak forecast from June 10, 2022.

In light of these results, JPMorgan has also reduced its estimates for Tesla's first-quarter revenue, now expecting $21.4 billion compared to the previous $25.6 billion, and below the consensus forecast of $23.5 billion. The firm's forecast for earnings per share (EPS) for the first quarter has been lowered to $0.42 from the prior estimate of $0.69, which is also beneath the consensus of $0.61.

The revised EPS forecast is a steep drop from the peak consensus of $1.94 before Tesla implemented a strategy of heavy discounting to boost unit volume in response to softening demand.

Moreover, JPMorgan now anticipates a significant free cash outflow of $1.3 billion for the first quarter, a reversal from its earlier expectation of a $300 million inflow, and contrary to the consensus for a $1 billion inflow. This expectation is based on the assumption of a record increase in finished goods inventory, as Tesla produced 47,000 more vehicles than it sold in the quarter.

This inventory buildup, according to JPMorgan, suggests that the lower deliveries were due to demand constraints rather than supply issues, refuting any implications that disruptions such as the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea or the fire incident at Tesla's Berlin Gigafactory were the primary causes.

JPMorgan warns that Tesla shares, which already saw a 4.9% decline on Tuesday compared to the S&P 500's 0.7% drop, could face further decreases if the company fails to quickly revive unit volume and revenue growth. The firm cautions that investors might reconsider the premium valuation multiple currently assigned to Tesla's stock in the absence of sustained growth.

2024-04-02 13:10:30,Tesla,TSLA,"Tesla reports 386,810 deliveries in the first quarter of 2024, produced 433,371 vehicles ","Tesla just published its first-quarter vehicle production and deliveries report for 2024. Here are the key numbers:

Total deliveries Q1 2024: 386,810
Total production Q1 2024: 433,371

Tesla doesn’t break out sales of its vehicles by model but reported that it produced 412,376 Model 3/Y cars and delivered 369,783 of those cars. It produced 20,995 of its other models and delivered 17,027.

In the same period last year, the electric automaker reported 422,875 deliveries and production of 440,808 vehicles. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Tesla reported 484,507 deliveries and production of 494,989 vehicles.

Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales reported by Tesla but are not precisely defined in the company’s shareholder communications.

According to a mean of 11 estimates compiled by FactSet, analysts were expecting deliveries of around 457,000 for the period ending March 31. Estimates ranged from a high of 511,000 deliveries to a low of 414,000 for the first quarter, with estimates updated in March ranging from 414,000 to 469,000 deliveries.

Independent auto industry researcher Troy Teslike, whose work is closely followed by Tesla fans, had expected deliveries to come in around 409,000.

Tesla’s head of investor relations Martin Viecha sent around a company-compiled consensus based on 30 analysts’ estimates over the weekend to select investors. The consensus, which was viewed by CNBC, said analysts were expecting a mean of 443,027 deliveries and a median of 431,125 deliveries for the quarter.

Tesla faced numerous challenges in the first quarter.

Houthi militia attacks on shippers in the Red Sea disrupted Tesla’s component supply and temporarily suspended production at its German factory outside of Berlin in January. In March, environmental activists set fire to infrastructure near that same factory, depriving Tesla of sufficient operation power and again causing a pause in production.

In China, Tesla faced an onslaught of competition from domestic EV makers, including BYD and newcomers such as the phone maker Xiaomi. After sluggish sales numbers for its China-made cars in January and February, Tesla reduced production of its Model 3 and Model Y at its Shanghai plant and slashed workers’ schedules to 5 days a week from 6 and a half days.

In the U.S., reviews were mixed for Tesla’s newest model — an angular pickup dubbed the Cybertruck — which the EV maker only began to sell in small numbers in December last year.

A series of discounts and incentives appeared to be less effective in driving sales volume than in the past for Tesla.

During the final days of the first quarter, Tesla CEO Elon Musk mandated that all sales and service staff install and demo the newest version of the company’s premium driver assistance system for customers in North America before handing over their cars. The system is marketed as Full Self-Driving but doesn’t make Tesla cars autonomous. They require a human at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.

Shares of Tesla dropped 29% in the first quarter, the biggest decline since the end of 2022 and the third-steepest quarterly plunge since the company’s IPO in 2010.

But, if it were that close I think it would’ve happened already.

My bet is if it’s solvable it may be decades away.

People forget that through history we have often been teased with “tomorrow’s tech today” and it doesn’t happen fully for 20 years.

Even if it seems close.

Sometimes what seems close is actually far away and the last gap is not easy to overcome.

Look at VR! The virtual boy was in the 90s and we just now have real VR. And it’s still not perfect.

The problem is unlike big tech Tesla doesn’t print money that they can throw at a moon shot forever.

I think Tesla returning to facebook even when Elon owns its rival is a huge red flag. Remember he swore it off before even buying Twitter and the dude is notorious for being one of the most stubborn people on the planet.

Not to mention, it reeks of desperation that he is claiming he wants to resort to the same tactics used by sellers of time shares to sell FSD… basically forcing people through a demo before they get their car.

2024-03-14 12:56:52,Tesla,TSLA,Tesla (TSLA) DCF Analysis,"***NOTE: NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE***

# Introduction:

TSLA is the world's most renowned Electric Vehicle(EV) automaker, catalyzing the world's acceleration towards Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) Vehicles. TSLA has become the gold standard for what a high-quality EV stands for, all thanks in part to their founder's vision and belief in renewable energy especially during the tumultuous early years of TSLA. TSLA no longer just stands for EV but renewable energy, having branched out into Energy Storage, and Solar Panels.  TSLA hopes to create an ecosystem for renewable energy from charging to energy storage to the vehicle used, all this tied together by dedicated software created by TSLA at every point of contact in the ecosystem. This ecosystem business model has seen massive success as evident from businesses like GOOG, AAPL, and MSFT. I believe the next frontier of growth for TSLA comes from energy storage rather than automotive, however automotive will still account for the largest chunk of revenue for TSLA.

# Market:

TSLA's closest EV competitor is BYD. TSLA has won BYD on almost every front. A country where BYD has managed to wrest control from TSLA is Thailand. So I'll analyze this market specifically to rationalize why I believe this victory will be shortlived.

In Thailand, the top 3 most popular car models are BYD Atto 3, Netta V, and BYD Dolphin ([SOURCE](https://carnewschina.com/2024/01/09/byd-is-bestselling-ev-brand-in-thailand-in-2023-neta-is-runner-up/)).   

|Model|Price|Range|
|:-|:-|:-|
|BYD Atto 3|1.1M Baht|521 km/charge|
|Neta V|0.55M Baht|380 km/charge|
|BYD Dolphin|0.75M Baht|427 km/charge|
|Tesla Model 3|1.59M Baht|513 km/charge|

In Thailand, 60.17% of the population owns a car ([SOURCE](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1027960/thailand-car-ownership-among-consumers/)) with the average car price being about 0.78M Baht. This means that a Tesla Model 3, TSLA's cheapest model is double the average price of a normal car in Thailand. 

[SOURCE](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1030220/thailand-average-monthly-income-per-household-by-region/)) which means that the Tesla Model 3 is a luxury good rather than an affordable commodity for the average household. The difference in price between BYD and Tesla is a full year's worth of income for the average household which leads the price-conscious consumers in Thailand to naturally gravitate towards BYD, hence the popularity of BYD over Tesla in Thailand.   
  
Ultimately, I do believe that if TSLA continues competing on quality and finds ways to cut costs such as directly setting up factories in Thailand ([SOURCE](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/03/05/business/thailand-tesla-factory-talks-intl-hnk/index.html)), it will be able to close the price gap with BYD. As ""people are really stretching their wallets to be able to afford a Tesla. It’s quite a difficult thing for them to do, and remarkable that it’s the best-selling car in unit volume, despite being much more expensive than other high-volume cars.” - 2023 Q4 Earnings Conference

# Revenue:

TSLA has 5 revenue channels, namely “Automotive Sales”, “Services and Others”, “Automotive Lease”, “Automotive Regulatory Credit” and “Energy Generation and Storage sales”. 

***Automotive Sales***

Automotive sales refers to the direct sale of TSLA’s vehicles fully paid upfront.

Elon Musk believes that manufacturing capabilities will be the most important C.A. for TSLA. “perhaps the most important competitive characteristic of Tesla in the future will be manufacturing technology” -  2023 Q4 Earnings Conference. 

When forecasting the Number of Vehicles each Gigafactory can produce, I took into account that Elon Musk recently unveiled in the 2023 Q4 Earnings conference that there is a new revolutionary manufacturing technology that is expected to drastically improve production. He hopes to pilot test this technology at the Texas Gigafactory to produce their low-cost EV before proceeding to replicate the technology in every Gigafactory. “the sensible way to go about things is kind of figure out the core technology of the manufacturing line and then replicate it with improvements throughout the world.” -  2023 Q4 Earnings Conference. So, in my first 3 years, I assume that the growth rate is below historical averages as TSLA tests out new technology in preparation for the launch of the low-cost EV. I assumed that TSLA’s manufacturing technology was successful.  
  
When forecasting %Vehicles delivered, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historical averages  
  
When forecasting Avg Price/Vehicles Delivered, Elon Musk doesn’t believe in price increases to increase the topline. As evident in 2021 and 2022 where Elon Musk only increased prices due to supply chain constraints before bringing prices back down in 2023. In China, Elon Musk ended up cutting prices due to being able to source significantly cheaper batteries there. I assumed that over time as TSLA enjoys sufficient economies of scale, they will only increase prices in line with perpetual inflation.  


***Services and Others***

TSLA provides a few services such as home servicing in certain regions or customers pay to access TSLA’s network of SuperChargers.  
  
Lifetime number of TSLA automobile (Ex roadster) delivered ([SOURCE](https://backlinko.com/tesla-stats))

Assuming that TSLA is properly maintained they can last \~20 years ([SOURCE](https://caredge.com/blog/how-long-tesla-batteries-last)). Opting for less granularity, in my forecast I assumed the total lifetime number of tesla cars remained constant without any churn.

When forecasting Services and Others, Opting for less granularity I assumed that the servicing’s pricing grew following the price of the vehicle in line with historic averages. 

  
***Automotive Lease***

TSLA has 2 types of lease, “Direct Vehicle Operations Lease” which leases out vehicles to customers for up to 48 months afterwards the vehicle is returned to TSLA. “Direct Sales Lease” either granting the customer title of the vehicle once full payment has been made or the customer has the option of refusing the vehicle.  
  
When forecasting Automotive leasing, as prices for TSLA fell in 2023, Automotive leasing as a percentage of Automotive Sales dropped as it is now cheaper for customers to purchase their tesla in 1 lump sum payment. I assumed that following this trend, as TSLA’s affordability increases over time the %Automotive Sales decreases as well before remaining constant in perpetuity.

  
***Automotive Regulatory Credit***

TSLA has excess carbon credit which it sells to competitors.

“It will continue for some period of time, but eventually this stream of regulatory credits will reduce.” ([SOURCE](https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-9-billion-revenue-selling-regulatory-credits-to-other-carmakers-2024-2)).  


When forecasting Automotive Regulatory Credit, given that TSLA does not intend to depend on these credits for revenue, I assume that as a %of Automotive sales, credit will contribute to a significantly lesser amount in perpetuity. This is further exacerbated by other automobile companies accelerating their push towards EVs as countries begin phasing out ICE vehicles. So, more companies begin having excess regulatory credits as well. Ultimately, I believe that leading up to 2030 the amount of revenue contributed by Regulatory credits decreases to a significant level. 

  
***Energy Generation and Storage Sales***

TSLA produces Energy Storage systems e.g. Megapack and Solar Energy related products e.g. Solar Panels which it directly sells to customers.  
  
For energy storage more specifically megapacks, as the world phases out ICE vehicles and begins embracing renewable energy, it leads to a surge in demand for electricity. However, the issue with renewable energy is that “The most common renewable energy sources like the sun and wind are intermittent or have lower baseload capabilities than coal, natural gas, or nuclear sources. This makes it necessary to have a way to conserve excess energy produced during peak hours. This extra energy can then be supplied through the grid or otherwise when the sun is down, or wind speed reduces.” ([SOURCE](https://www.batterycycle.io/why-is-tesla-focusing-on-the-battery-energy-storage-market/)). As an example to elaborate on how much importance is placed on energy storage, China mandates that all renewable energy facilities must store at least 20% of their total output ([SOURCE](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiYquPrkuaEAxXuSGwGHffzBkgQFnoECA0QAw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Ferikkobayashisolomon%2F2023%2F12%2F20%2Fenergy-vault-wins-big-with-gravity-storage-in-china%2F%23%3A~%3Atext%3DChina%2520has%2520mandated%2520that%2520all%2Cgeneration%2520capacity%27s%2520worth%2520of%2520storage.&usg=AOvVaw3WMq0w9-2ka0Cz2kAGbCWX&opi=89978449)).  
  
The closest competitor to TSLA in energy pack is BYD. The TSLA’s megapack is smaller in dimensions compared to BYD and on top of that TSLA has built its own software to be compatible with the megapack hardware with features such as Autobidder (Software to optimize energy trading) and Powerhub.  
  
Right now what's stopping revenue for energy storage is production capacity, TSLA opened its megapack factory in Lathrop to curb this. TSLA has also announced its plans to build a megapack factory in China to assist with production capacity ([SOURCE](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-22/tesla-acquires-land-for-shanghai-megapack-battery-factory)). As an overarching goal for my forecast, I took into account the TSLA master plan 3.  
  
When forecasting number of dedicated megapack factories opened, I assumed that TSLA would open 1 additional plant every 3 years for the next 10 years, to meet the large surge in demand as countries accelerate their push towards renewable energy.  
  
When forecasting Max Output/Factory, taking into account this article on expected output. ([SOURCE](https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2023/11/tesla-megapack-factory-production-limit-solved-and-capacity-will-be-doubled-to-80-gwh.html)). TSLA’s Lathrop Megapack factory can produce 80GWh/Year in part due to them doubling their existing lines and resolving certain issues. Over time I believe that TSLA can massively increase the Max Output/Factory, as TSLA consistently touts their innovations as having an S curve of progression, where progress is slower at the earlier stages before exponentially increasing.   
As a sanity check, in my base case assuming that all Mega packs are still at 4 MWh. TSLA has to produce 406,200 Mega Packs or 81,240 Mega Pack per factory a year by 2038. As of November 2023, the Lathrop factory can produce 20,000 megapack. So, in 15 years I believe it is a reasonable amount of time necessary for TSLA to ramp up their production 4x.  
  
When forecasting %GWh Deployed, I had to assume total output which is a function of max output and the number of gigafatories. I assumed that over the years as more countries begin phasing out ICE vehicles in favor of EVs, there is a larger need to deploy more energy storage so this % increases to a large extent.  
  
When forecasting Avg Sales/GWh Deployed, Elon Musk does not like to increase sales through increasing pricing which was why when TSLA enjoyed economies of scale from increasing output in their Lathrop factory the Avg Sales/GWh Deployed decreased. So, applying this principle of TSLA slashing prices when costs decrease due to economies of scale, I assumed that TSLA continued slashing prices before increasing by the perpetual inflation rate.

# Cost:

“predicting auto gross margins is extremely challenging since there are many moving parts to this equation, some of which are out of our control like the change in tariffs or local incentives to name a few. While the teams are focused on cost reductions, we are approaching the limits within our current platforms.” - 2023 Q4 Earnings Conference. 

  
When forecasting Automotive and Non-Automtoive COGS, COGS as a %revenue for 2021 and 2022 are likely to be lower due to TSLA pre-emptively increasing sales price to deal with inflation. However, in 2023 COGS as a %revenue increased as TSLA cut back on sales price. Going forward, I’ll assume that TSLA tends towards historic pre-covid average. However, in the long run, as TSLA successfully implements their manufacturing technology this % will decrease even further.  
When forecasting R&D, SG&A, and Others, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic averages.

# WACC:

US 10Y T-Bond (1M Avg) = 4.12%  
Beta ([SOURCE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/)) = 2.41  
Stable Market ERP ([SOURCE](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/ctryprem.html)) = 4.60%  
COE = 15.21%  
   
TSLA is rated at BAA3 ([SOURCE](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DBAA))  
COD (1M Avg) = 5.72%  
Marginal Tax Rate = 21.00%  
AT-COD = 4.52%  
  
Market Price (5D Avg) = $178.50  
Shares O/S = 3184.79M  
Market Value of Equity = 568485.02M  
  
Weighted Average Maturity = 2 Years  
FY23 Interest Expense = 156M  
Market Value of Debt = 4578.78M  
%Debt = 0.80%  
%Equity = 99.20%  
WACC = 15.12%  
  
Currently, TSLA has a very large beta as its stock has increased in volatility in the past few years. However, I believe that this volatility will not persist for very long as most big tech stocks enter a stable stage where their beta tends downwards. So, as a proxy for how low TSLA’s beta will tend to, I looked at other big tech stocks.



|Name|Beta|
|:-|:-|
|Google (GOOG)|1.04|
|Microsoft (MSFT)|0.89|
|Meta (META)|1.21|

Taking the average beta, we arrive at a beta of 1.05. Assuming similar D/E composition and bond rating. I assumed that it took another 10 years for TSLA to reach the stable state.  
  
Stable State COE = 8.95%  
Stable State AT-COD = 4.52%  
TSLA’s stable stage WACC = 8.90%  


# Conclusion:

Ultimately in my base case, I value TSLA at $186.88 per share. I believe that there is still room for TSLA to grow, having such a strong first movers advantage in the renewable energy market means that TSLA is heads and shoulders above its competitors. I believe that the market is undervaluing the Energy Storage arm of TSLA's business, and less emphasis is placed on this potentially disruptive segment of business.

2024-03-13 18:47:04,Tesla,TSLA,"If you were down 5 figures on a stock but you'd buy it at its current price, would you double down? [TSLA]","Due to the nature of my work I cannot sell uncovered options. I need 100 shares. I currently own 45 with an average buy price of $370.

It's currently at $170. If I didn't own the stock, I would buy it now.

Is it worth buying because it's cheap? I would buy another 55, just so I can sell 1 option contract OTM, 1 month out for a measly 30-100 bucks or so.

Due to the nature of my job, I can only do 30 days or longer selling covered calls, so the best strategy woukd be to let them expire. I also am not allowed to buy options less than 1 year out.

My overall portfolio is still up, but this one weighs heavy on me. Lol.

Edit: for those asking about the restrictions, I work at a BD and cannot speculate (thus no naked calls) or day trade or do anything that would appear that I am manipulating the market. Everything I do must be pre approved as well. Yes, a wall street person can lose money in their PA. None of this is financial advice. Please don't do what I'm doing lol.

2024-03-09 23:01:29,Tesla,TSLA,Should I just sell my individual stocks and dump everything into ETFs?,"I took some advice a few years ago which was extremely dumb of me. Now, all my stock picks - TTWO, SPOT, BABA, TSLA, DIS, ETSY - have actively lost me a LOT of money. They're all sitting at 5%-65% losses over multiple years. Meanwhile the two ETFs I'm in have absolutely rocketed over that time-period (QQQ and VOO). It's so frustrating because if I'd have just gone 100% into the ETFs, I would have made so much more money. Obviously that's why ETFs exist and picking stocks is left to professionals..

Still, now, I don't know whether to just sell the above stocks at a loss and go into the ETFs or if that's just me being rash. Each of them are strong companies, for example BABA is underpriced although I know that's because of politics in China, and even the 'overpriced' ones have their arguments of possibly going up more than the ETFs in the future for various reasons (GTA VI is going to be absolutely huge for TTWO, I don't think it's fully priced in yet, and TSLA speculation) but also I don't want to just lose a bunch of money again. At this point is it worth just holding onto them for the possible upswing?

But even highly traded options like SPY, QQQ, TSLA, NVDA have low volumes. For instance, average total traded value of each leg of SPY is around 200K. 

Assuming a trader makes 50% or $50K in a day, they'd have to be working with a $100K capital, right? One trader said he trades with a capital of 150K on just SPY. How's that possible with options given lack of liquidity? Even trading multiple legs may not work.

So I did manually, based on trailing PE weighted by market cap.

The only apparent overvaluation looks in the electronic technology sector, but we all know the reason (AI/GPU wave).

2024-02-15 13:21:51,Tesla,TSLA,EV school bus company BLBD.  $9 to $31 (and rising).,"I started investing in EV school bus company BLBD at $9/share.  Right before Biden was elected.  I knew that if he won, a national conversion from internal combustion buses to electric would begin.  Today, the stock is at $31.  The EV school bus conversion is just beginning, and BLBD is well positioned for it.

Most school buses fleets are perfect for EV conversion.  Routes and charging schedules are very predictable, and the lower EV bus maintenance costs offset the higher initial investment needed.  And of course, with the Biden administration has come incentives.  Another interesting thing to know is that a charged fleet of buses can be used to power a community in emergencies (this is called V2G, or Vehicle to Grid).

So far my investment has been very successful.  $9 to $31, etc.  BLBD just recieved a record order for 180 EV buses.  They recently delivered their 1,500th EV bus.  They now have an Electric Vehicle Build-up Center with an annual capacity of up to 5,000 electric school buses.

This company is like a mini version of TSLA.  One of the few un-tapped opportunities remaining in the EV space.  Sharing all this because I think it’s exciting.  I’m an engineer, and I like the product they build.  I like the stock, and I want them to succeed.  Definitely check BLBD out, and let me know your thoughts.",0,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1arfamq/ev_school_bus_company_blbd_9_to_31_and_rising/

Before I go further, this is just a discussion post, not necessarily a “technical analysis”.

Full disclosure, I’ve just recently yeeted into a decent chunk of my portfolio into Rivian averaging $15.50/share.

Yes, they keep asking for offerings for multiple billions of dollars in new funding, but it’s for the right reasons, and theoretically the correct results of in just a few years increasing their production capacity from 25k to over 500k. It takes massive capital to due this feat. Something I don’t think any other EV brand outside of TSLA is able to do, while also having the most superior product in the industry. 

The even better news being the demand has only skyrocketed, and (hope I don’t jinx it with upcoming quarterly report) there doesn’t seem to be signs of slowing demand. Which is huge because right now their cheapest car is $80k, and they’re soon announcing their $40k line that should supplement their existing $80k lines and commercial delivery truck lines to hit their max 500k capacity.

To me, my yolo bolo brain. It does not seem like a bizzare bet that in 2026 they sell at their 500k capacity as their popularity within the United States is still climbing, and launching an affordable line is only going to increase interest. 

Not to mention it’s a severely superior car to any Tesla line, and SUV/Trucks are largely preferred over sedans in the wealth class that can afford these vehicles in the U.S.",42,65,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1amv6rk/headfirst_into_the_rivn_pool/
