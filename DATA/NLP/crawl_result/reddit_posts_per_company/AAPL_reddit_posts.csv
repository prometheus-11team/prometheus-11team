2025-04-28 22:32:06,Apple,AAPL,"Stock market today: Dow, S&P 500 erase slide to rise for 5th straight day in lead up to Big Tech earnings","Stocks closed mixed on Monday but recovered from sharp losses to begin a big week of heavyweight earnings reports and macroeconomic data that will continue to paint an early picture of the US economy's response to President Trump's tariffs.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) erased losses of as much as 1% to rise just above the flatline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) edged up 0.3%, notching its longest win streak of 2025. Both indexes ended in positive territory for the fifth straight day.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell below the flatline, as shares of Big Tech recovered from steep early-session losses.

Wall Street is coming off a rebounding run last week. The gains came as Trump eased pressure on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, and hinted at light at the end of the tunnel for sky-high 145% tariffs on China. On Monday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said it was ""up to China"" to deescalate the trade battle, though he suggested its recent moves to exempt certain US goods from duties represented a positive step.

Earnings are the highlight of the week ahead, with 180 S&P 500 companies expected to report quarterly financial results. Big Tech leads the way, as Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) are all due in the coming days, alongside Coca-Cola (KO), Eli Lilly (LLY), and Chevron (CVX).

Broader economic news will flavor the coming days, as investors eye Wednesday's release of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumer Expenditures (PCE) index, to see the impact of tariffs on the general public's ""core"" expenses. An initial reading on first quarter US GDP is also due Wednesday.

The April jobs report is also in sight, as the labor market has so far remained resistant to signs of economic slowdown.

The April jobs report is also in sight, as the labor market has remained resistant to signs of economic slowdown. Economists expect the US economy added 133,000 nonfarm payroll jobs last month, with the unemployment rate remaining at 4.2%.

The most critical reading may be the non-farm payrolls report on Friday, as the market expects an addition of about 125K jobs.

The goldilocks read may be around 100-150K jobs. We don't want a number that is too strong, as it would likely decrease the probabilities for future rate cuts. At the same time, we don't want a number that is perceived as too weak, as it would imply that the economy may be worsening more rapidly than anticipated, raising recession and other concerns.

2025-04-27 14:02:37,Apple,AAPL,Did I 'miss the boat' on RDDT?,"Pretty much what the title says. I've been taking a conservative approach to buying the dip — mostly adding to my SCHD position. It dipped, but it's been holding up better than a lot of my other holdings, and I like having steady dividend income to reinvest elsewhere.



That said, I know I've been neglecting tech. I’ve got a small position in AMZN and an even smaller one in AAPL.



My original plan for May was to bulk up on LMT (not a tech company, but adjacent in some ways) because I think that will go back up again at some point.



I also noticed RDDT is still down — not as much as it was during the big dip last week, but enough to catch my eye. I've seen it move pretty fast when momentum is on its side.



What's the best move here? I get that no one can predict or time the market — just looking for some solid advice or gut checks as I figure out my next steps for some near-future gains.",0,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1k94o78/did_i_miss_the_boat_on_rddt/

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2025-04-23 13:09:57,Apple,AAPL,"Interesting Stocks Today (04/23) - Trump plans to be ""very nice"" to China!","Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

News: [Trump Says He'll Be Very Nice To China In Trade Talks](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-23/trump-says-he-ll-be-very-nice-to-china-in-trade-talks)

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\- Reported Q1 earnings with EPS of $0.27 vs. $0.39 expected and revenue of $19.34B vs. $21.11B expected. Total revenue declined 9% year-over-year, with automotive revenue dropping 20% to $14B. Net income fell 71% to $409M, or $0.12 per share. The company attributed the decline to factory retooling for the refreshed Model Y, lower average selling prices, and increased sales incentives. That was a brutal earnings report, yet Trump announcing that he'll be nice to China saved the stock and pushed the entire market up. Interested in $275 and $250 levels.

[**SPY**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SPY&p=d) **/** [**QQQ**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=QQQ&p=d) **/** [**VXX**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&p=d) **/ China Stocks** / **Tech Stocks**\- President Trump signaled a potential substantial reduction in China tariffs, which currently stand at 145%. Whether this will actually hold and be his stance going forward is entirely up to him (he changed his mind a lot during 2019's trade wars). Assuming that the market holds up today, I'm primarily watching my current positions in NVDA/AAPL and ready to flip short if we make some ridiculously unsustainable move or if Trump changes his mind.

[**LLY (Eli Lilly)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=LLY&p=d)\-Filed lawsuits against four telehealth companies for selling unauthorized compounded versions of its GLP-1 drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound. (LLY's diabetes drug Mounjaro went into short supply in 2022, allowing pharmacies and outsourcing facilities to produce the treatment, a practice called compounding). These drugs generated over $16.4B in revenue last year. Interestingly enough I see this case as pretty major despite not moving the stock significantly today, deciding whether GLP-1 is essentialy ""genericized"" to the point where any company can sell it or only the original developers of the drug. NVO might face the same thing in the future. If LLY loses, that's a huge blow for both of them.

[**HTZ (Hertz)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HTZ&p=d)\-The potential rollback of tariffs by the Trump administration could negatively impact Ackman's thesis that used cars are more valuable due to tariffs. The stock is nearing $9, the previous high when the tariff news was announced. I'm interested in shorting the stock if we make a parabolic move up or if we fail to break $9 (but as always, it's dependent on how we get there). Automotive rental companies have benefited from higher used car values amid tariff-induced supply constraints.

2025-04-19 06:17:49,Apple,AAPL,This market is really not behaving well. Where do we most likely go from here?,"I think traders and close market analysts realize this more than many people do. From a technical standpoint of course, but a fundamental one.
Fundamental I mean - The concerns that the market was overvalued in the first place... And that trump was going to drop a bomb on the market and dollar itself in some way, shape or form. The foregone conclusion by MSM when the bearish market began in early March that it was just tariffs and trump, or ""still a bull market"" as portrayed by cnbc and then by more MSM once we dropped more than 5 percent. The fact more people than now rely more on retirement appreciation - many times a sign of or near a market top. The talk of depression, parallels to Hoover, Smoot - Hawley, etc. I seriously doubt I honestly was the only one who had my strongest worries since when covid was emerging (but this time feels worse...)

Some concerning features to me are the number of new investors /traders who keep thinking 2020 and 2022 bottoms were like this and now more than ever I'm hearing (accurately ) big drops feel scary, and they always recover. They don't have to always, it's just that they recently have. 

So yeah, I guess that's the question. I don't have a crystal ball of where we are going, but where is it most likely to go? The price action last week was fairly flat-for this market. (down 8 pts on SPY) , but felt genuinely mostly worse than that. Worse case-I fear there will be an added crisis fueled by Trump in the near term or something else internal/ external but important - causing a severe down leg once again. Perhaps that could be poor earnings next week with added economic concerns, Trump firing powell and wrecking the dollar and markets more, or more countries forming ""anti USA"" trade alliances. Best case? Do we move flat in a kangaroo market? Is there significant upside potential if strong earnings come in? I've asked myself the last question a lot, and normally I'd say yes, but now I doubt that, or that the risk/reward will be skewed severely to the downside.

This is kind of the first generalized thing I've felt I could say with any degree of confidence in a while. I could look like a stupid fool a year from now, but maybe not. 

Here's what I've done that's not in any way trading related.  I'm adding to foreign businesses and bonds. For a larger non trading account that can't take heavy risk, that's not my own per se we bought German bonds and more Nokia stock. The bonds are up 5 percent due to the euro, and Nokia is flat. I like Nokia's business as they are not exposed to the tariff nonsense and have big contracts to provide 4g in developing countries still on older networks. This is huge business for them. I'm keeping the Berkshire position, I added to it last year, although I'm a bit surprised by its resilience so far, though I also kept Google (it's doing much worse than I would've expected) but sold two other tech stocks, aapl and Msft. Sold apple when I realized how much Berkshire itself had dumped of apple. Sold Msft because comparably it seemed more expensive and vulnerable in this downturn I thought was likely.



There's a school of thought that says ""markets aren't supposed to make us always feel comfortable"" and that this is why long term holders, ten or more years, will ""always"" or almost always be rewarded as a result. That's generally, but not always been accurate for the past 50 years.
Another consideration:what do you personally feel most of the public feels who have moderate stock exposure? I'm talking like portfolios of $50,000-$500,000. Some of these people may not pay attention to the markets much, but would be overly concerned of a significant market drop. They may just own etfs, or general retail investors. I personally feel many of these people are not overly concerned right now. ",244,289,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1k2psh8/this_market_is_really_not_behaving_well_where_do/

Hey everyone,

After years of bouncing between trends, missing some massive moves (energy in 2022, early AI), and learning from crashes like 2020 and 2022, I’ve built what I hope is a **macro-resilient, globally balanced, thematic long-term portfolio**.

It’s designed to:

* Withstand **2020-style collapses**
* Endure **2022 inflation + rate shocks**
* Thrive in **AI, robotics, green energy, space, and aging population megacycles**
* Hold through decades — **not just years**

Would love your takes, critiques, and improvements.

   * Macro event simulator (e.g., inflation, recession, war)
   * Crash Mode vs Growth Mode toggle engine
* **Annual investor memo**: for strategy evolution + journaling conviction
* **Legacy tab**: preps this as a family sovereign fund if held forever

# What I’m Trying to Solve

I wanted something that:

* Doesn’t rely on me watching CNBC every day
* Doesn’t panic-sell when things get ugly
* Still captures long-term megatrends
* Feels like a **real system**, not a Reddit FOMO portfolio

# Looking for Feedback On:

* Am I *too* diversified?
* Should I consolidate some ETFs or lean harder into fewer themes?
* Am I missing any critical macro theme? (nuclear? private credit? Agri?)
* Would you trust this structure to grow for 30+ years with minimal maintenance?

Looking forward to your feedback on this.

[Gold](https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/investing/article/gold-price-today-wednesday-april-16-2025-gold-opens-with-new-high-134956304.html) has surpassed the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks as the most crowded trade on Wall Street as the precious metal surged to record highs this year amid volatile markets and an uncertain economic backdrop.

According to the latest Bank of America fund managers survey published this week, nearly half of the fund managers surveyed (49%) see long gold, or bets that gold prices will rise, as the most crowded trade in the market right now. This marks the first time in two years that fund managers did not see the Magnificent Seven as Wall Street's most crowded trade, according to the survey.

Gold futures ([GC=F](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GC=F/)) on Wednesday rose to an all-time high of $3,334 as investors continued to [favor the safe-haven asset](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-notches-best-week-since-2020-amid-shaken-investor-confidence-in-us-201546983.html) amid a falling US dollar ([DX-Y.NYB](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/DX-Y.NYB/__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!HIhgXKgPRojUSTTqYlaKSTMqCnabU-_BFJYcQNg1l9bJcllZ1Gp3LtN-1O0pcbknpYvKz0DBczt7-zHHf99GDzXJ1VfxDc7wuw$)) and tariff uncertainty.

Gold prices have surged more than 27% year to date, while the Magnificent Seven tech stocks — Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)), Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL), [GOOG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG)), Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)), Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)), Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)), Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)), and Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) — are down considerably.

Tesla stock has led Magnificent Seven losses and is down about 38% since the start of 2025. Apple stock has fallen 21%.

Nvidia stock has also declined 21% year to date. On Wednesday,[ the AI chip giant warned of a multibillion-dollar ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-dives-as-chipmaker-sees-55-billion-hit-from-surprise-china-chip-controls-130319576.html)impact from US export controls on China, which weighed on shares.

Shares of Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon — the remainder of the Magnificent Seven — are all down by double-digit percentages since the start of the year.

Gold's rally comes as [central banks' demand hit all-time highs](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-demand-hits-record-levels-as-central-banks-buy-at-eye-watering-pace-205945413.html) last year and as investors increased inflows into physical gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

""The new highs in gold are signaling a shift in appetite for US assets,"" Ryan McIntyre, senior managing partner at asset manager firm Sprott, recently told Yahoo Finance.

""Confidence in the US has clearly been shaken, so people are looking to diversify.""

Wall Street analysts have remained bullish on gold, [upping their price forecasts ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-keeps-upping-its-bullish-calls-on-gold--heres-why-162732492.html)on the precious metal even amid its fast ascent.

Some 42% of fund managers expect gold will be the best-performing asset of 2025, up from 23% in March, according to Bank of America.

The firm's survey also showed investors have rotated out of US assets by a record amount over the past two months, with 73% of respondents saying ""US exceptionalism"" has peaked.",449,54,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1k0nih7/after_surge_to_record_highs_gold_overtakes/

# Key Takeaways

* Netflix shares jumped Tuesday after a report company executives laid out ambitious targets at a business review meeting last month.
* The streaming giant aims to double its revenue by 2030 and reach a market capitalization of $1 trillion, *The* *Wall Street Journal* reported Monday.
* Netflix is set to report first-quarter results after the market closes Thursday.

Netflix (NLFX) shares jumped Tuesday following a report company executives laid out ambitious targets at a business review meeting last month.

Executives said the streaming giant aims to double the $39 billion in revenue Netflix brought in last year, with a global ad sales target of $9 billion by 2030, *The* *Wall Street Journal* reported Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The streaming giant also aims to reach a [market capitalization](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp) of $1 trillion by 2030, the report said, up from roughly $419.2 billion. The only U.S. companies with a market cap above $1 trillion today include Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B).

Netflix did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Shares were up more than 5% in recent trading Tuesday, leading gains on the S&P 500. They've added about 60% of their value over the past 12 months. (Read *Investopedia's* live coverage of [today's market action here](https://www.investopedia.com/dow-jones-today-04152025-11715325).)

Last week, Morgan Stanley analysts named Netflix a [“top pick,”](https://www.investopedia.com/netflix-a-top-pick-for-morgan-stanley-on-expected-resilience-to-a-weaker-market-11712037) arguing the company could be well-positioned to withstand the current tariff landscape. The streaming giant has shown ""momentum” in its core subscription business, the analysts said. That momentum lowers the company’s overall risk, the bank added, even if the advertising market struggles amid rising trade tensions.

Netflix is [set to report its first-quarter results](https://www.investopedia.com/what-analysts-think-of-netflix-stock-ahead-of-earnings-q1-fy2025-11712295) after the market closes Thursday.",427,166,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jzvy6f/netflix_stock_pops_after_report_streaming_giant/

[**MP (MP Materials)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MP&p=d)\- Trump is preparing an executive order to establish a U.S. strategic reserve of critical rare earth minerals and metals, aiming to reduce U.S. dependence on China, which has recently halted exports of seven rare earth elements to the U.S. in response to trade tensions. Interested in MP's $30 level. Rare earth metals are important because they're used in technology, electronics, defense, and literally everything with a computer, with China controlling over 80% of all REMs. It is noteworthy that China entirely refines these metals and produces 90% of the global supply of these magnets. We're back in BLOPS2 baby! 

[**BA (Boeing)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BA&p=d)\-China has ordered its airlines to suspend deliveries of Boeing jets and halt purchases of aircraft-related equipment and parts from U.S. companies, a direct response to the U.S. imposing tariffs as high as 145% on Chinese goods. Interested in the $150 level. China is a significant market for BA, accounting for a substantial portion (20%!) of its projected deliveries over the next two decades. Despite being far smaller in comparison to Airbus, BA's planes are reserved years in advance, making it difficult for China to avoid using U.S. planes.

[**BULL (Webull Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BULL&p=d)\-Webull Corporation completed a reverse merger with SK Growth Opportunities Corporation and is finally listed after delaying their IPO for years. Overall not interested in this unless we break yesterday's highs, as the price 8x'ing seems ludicrous for a company that should be priced relatively easily (because we have comparables such as HOOD/other brokerages). I'm biased negatively on this stock today.

[**NVDA (Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\-Nvidia has announced plans to invest up to $500B in building AI supercomputers entirely in the United States. This initiative includes establishing over a million square feet of manufacturing space in Texas, partnering with companies like Foxconn and Wistron. This seems like a play to avoid getting semis tariffed, although the outcome is uncertain, especially with Trump announcing upcoming tariffs in a month or two. Overall see a lot more uncertainty in this stock and AAPL, so extremely important to be aware of the tariff narrative.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2025-04-10 18:20:47,Apple,AAPL,This is a classic short squeeze pattern and I'm surprised no one is talking about it.,"It seems that very, very few people are seeing this for what it is:  A *market-scale* short squeeze.

1. The market was well on its way to entering bear country, and a lot of short positions are sure to follow, particularly with firms that stand to lose the most with tariffs, such as AAPL.
2. Trump posts that ""now is a great time to buy,"" prompting retail investors to flood the markets with purchase orders in advance of an expected announcement, driving up prices and making those with short positions nervous.
3. The announcement actually happens, prompting even more retail investors to buy any large cap stock that sounds reliable (despite having done no prior analysis or thinking).  This drives up prices even higher.
4. Short sellers begin exiting their positions and buying more, driving up prices on everything, including those that would be expected to continue losing amid the China tariffs, such as AAPL.
5. Boom, near-record ""gains"" market-wide, even on stocks that should still be losing, confusing everyone.
6. The next day, those who took long positions exit to capitalize on their gains, resulting in a return to fair market value.

This was a disaster for a lot of people.  Short sellers lost their collective asses yesterday.  It was still a massive loss for investors overall.

My opinion (not financial advice): I'd be selling any position I didn't enter for the long term and exiting this market until calmer seas prevail.  This president has no idea what effects his words have on markets, and is causing havoc that he's not even aware of.  He *thinks* yesterday was a huge win, but in actuality it was a bloodbath for a lot of people.

News: [US Stock Futures Rise As Dip Buyers Emerge After Selloff](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-08/us-stock-futures-rise-as-dip-buyers-emerge-after-selloff)

[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\-China retaliates with an 84% tariff on US goods. The tariff escalation adds further pressure- Apple has flown literal planeloads of iPhones out of China but that's obviously a stop-gap measure. We've seen AAPL fall to $169, massively beyond what I could have even hoped. Still flat this but probably the #1 play if expecting a tariff reversal- the White House and Trump have signaled that tariffs are here to stay. Currently long a little from $170, but will bail if we hit those prices premarket/at the open.

[**WMT (Walmart)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=WMT&p=d), [**TGT (Target)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TGT&p=d)\-WMT scraps quarterly operating income forecast, citing Trump’s tariffs. They did cite net sales growing 3-4% this year. WMT backing away from guidance signals the ""we are in danger"" alarm over tariff impact on import costs and consumer demand even with net sales growing. TGT, with similar exposure, is likely to experience margin pressure in coming quarters. Margins are squeezed massively (and retailers are likely to take a loss on some goods simply because it's untenable to continue selling for a loss). 

[**DAL (Delta)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DAL&p=d)\- CEO states Trump tariffs are hurting bookings, and was unable to reaffirm guidance. Forecasted Q2 EPS of $1.70–$2.30 vs. $2.23 est. Revenue to range -2% - +2% YoY vs. +1.9% est. Tariff fears hitting forward travel demand are a red flag, especially international bookings. Airlines face multiple macro pressures—tariffs, softening travel sentiment, currency exchange fluctuations, etc, overall a different set of circumstances from COVID yet as deadly. 

[**TLT (iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TLT&p=d)\-Massive afterhours move as China sells U.S. Treasuries, resulting in a 5 point move afterhours. Bloomberg is also citing an unwind of popular hedge fund trade. The scale and consistency of the move suggest a structural shift, not just positioning. Treasury market dislocation is raising systemic risk signals across asset classes. I think we've hit roughly \~5% for the 20 year which is a big deal- China dumping treasuries means that yields go up but exacerbate inflation in the short term, and add to volatility.

[**HUM (Humana)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HUM&p=d), [**CVS (CVS Health)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CVS&p=d), [**UNH (UnitedHealth Group)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UNH&p=d)\-Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced higher-than-expected Medicare Advantage payment rate increases for 2026. The unexpected increase in reimbursement rates is a huge tailwind for these providers, improving profit outlooks into 2026.

2025-04-07 01:31:34,Apple,AAPL,"A $2,300 Apple iPhone? Trump tariffs could make that happen.","April 3 (Reuters) - Your favorite iPhone could soon become much pricier, thanks to tariffs.

U.S. President Donald Trump imposed a series of sweeping tariffs on countries around the world that could drastically alter the landscape of global trade, and consumer goods like iPhones could be among the hardest hit, analysts said on Thursday, with increases of 30% to 40% if the company were to pass on the cost to consumers.

Most iPhones are still made in China, which was hit with a 54% tariff. If those levies persist, Apple (AAPL.O), opens new tab has a tough choice: absorb the extra expense or pass it on to customers.

Shares of the company closed down 9.3% on Thursday, hitting their worst day since March 2020.

Apple sells more than 220 million iPhones a year; its biggest markets include the United States, China and Europe.

The cheapest iPhone 16 model was launched in the U.S. with a sticker price of $799, but could cost as much as $1,142, per calculations based on projections from analysts at Rosenblatt Securities, who say the cost could rise by 43% - if Apple is able to pass that on to consumers.

A more expensive iPhone 16 Pro Max, with a 6.9-inch display and 1 terabyte of storage, which currently retails at $1599, could cost nearly $2300 if a 43% increase were to pass to consumers.

**China announced a 34% tariff on the US. The US may retaliate. ""Reciprocal"" tariffs can result in a positive feedback loop of the tariff percentage.**

**AVGO, NXPI, LRCX, AMAT- ALL OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE 20%+ OF THEIR SALES COME FROM CHINA)**\- China imposing a 34% tariff on US imports escalates trade tensions and impacts supply chains, all of which have significant exposure to China. Overall, most interested in NVDA at $95/$90 and possibly INTC at $20 if we don't spike off the open. I'm leaning more bearish for today due to the news being announced so early premarket from China, and also from the fear of the US announcing additional tariffs.

[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\- AAPL broke $200 premarket following the announcement- mainly due to approximately 20% of AAPL revenue comingfrom China. I'm interested mainly if it breaks $190 intraday. AAPL relies heavily on China for manufacturing, with over 90% of its production based there and newly imposed tariffs are expected to increase AAPL’s annual costs by $8.5B. China adding more tariffs affects AAPL as it is clearly the biggest MAG7 loser of the tariffs. Main risks involve increased production costs, potential price hikes for consumers, and a possible decline in sales volume because our damn phones get far more expensive. Additionally, further escalation in trade tensions could lead to more severe supply chain disruptions. 

[**VXX (VIX Short-Term Futures ETN)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&p=d)\- I still don't think we've peaked (as I mentioned yesterday). We've spiked to \~$40 on the VIX ($75 on VXX). I'm interested in seeing how the US will respond to China tariffs before making any significant trades. The risk in the VXX short is based on overnight headlines from China announcing more tariffs (which already happened), and now, waiting for the US to retaliate. Fun.

[**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d)**,** [**FXI (China Large-Cap ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FXI&p=d)**,** [**YINN (China Bull 3X Shares)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=YINN&p=d)**,** [**YANG (China Bear 3X Shares)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=YANG&p=d)**,** [**JD (JD.com)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=JD&p=d)\- China-related stocks are selling off due to expectations of retaliation from the US. Also currently just a ""watch"", everything hinges on if the US backs off from tariffs or if we escalate. Interested in BABA if it hits $100.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2025-04-03 19:34:34,Apple,AAPL,How the USA government calculated the % tariffs charged to the USA by each country,"Yesterday many were confused about how did the government came with such numbers, which were too high for some countries (vietnam), cause this numbers made no sense taking into account current tariffs, some were thinking it was weight based taking into account most traded products or if currency change had something to do with it.

But the reality was much simpler:

This is how it was calculated:

\- They just took the total exports and imports with x country and thats it

Example:

\- China: 

U.S. Imports from China: The United States imported goods worth $438.9 billion from China in 2024.

U.S. Exports to China: The United States exported goods worth $143.5 billion to China in 2024.

(439-143.5)/439=67%

\- Vietnam:

(136.6-13)/136.6=90%

\- Japan:

(148.2-80)/148.2=46%

\- India:

(87.4-41.8)/87.4=52%

Now what does that tells you? 

1.- The reciprocal tariffs or the half vs what they calculated is way too high cause it doesn't reflect the real tariffs

2.- the 10% tariffs will likely wont get moved no matter what x country does (argentina etc), all the countries that import more from usa got the 10% tariff.

3.- Whats the goal of giving such high tariffs? 

\- You can speculate and reach a conclusion on your own, my bet is that they want 2 things:

1: they want the x country to lower some tariffs on some USA products

2: they want billions of investments to USA, like how certain companies already are doing, like aapl, honda, softbank, etc. 

With this Info now you can speculate how things will get worse or better, but the key here is the situation with the key countries, Japan, China, EU, Mexico, vietnam, etc. ",143,56,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jqrvom/how_the_usa_government_calculated_the_tariffs/
2025-04-03 18:13:52,Apple,AAPL,"Apple sheds $300 billion in tariff-fueled sell-off, on track for worst drop since March 2020","[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-sheds-300-billion-in-tariff-fueled-sell-off-on-track-for-worst-drop-since-march-2020-175727479.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-sheds-300-billion-in-tariff-fueled-sell-off-on-track-for-worst-drop-since-march-2020-175727479.html)

Tech stocks plummeted on Thursday, with Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)) leading ""Magnificent Seven"" names lower following President Trump's[ reciprocal tariff announcement](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-every-country-facing-reciprocal-tariffs-announced-by-trump-on-liberation-day-231329935.html) the day prior.

Shares of Apple, on track for their worst day since March 2020, cratered over 8% in afternoon trade as the stock erased $300 billion from its market cap. The largest risk, according to analysts, centers on the iPhone maker's overseas production hubs, which are particularly vulnerable to the tariffed countries.

On Wednesday, Trump announced tariffs that will impact some 185 countries, including the United States's largest trading partners. Additional reciprocal tariffs, for instance, will include 34% tariffs on Chinese imports, a 20% tariff on European Union imports, a 46% tariff on imports from Vietnam, 32% on imports from Taiwan, and 26% on India — all set to take effect on April 9.

Notably, the additional 34% tax on China will be added to the country's existing 20% tariff, meaning its total tariff rate will rise to 54%. China is Apple's most important [production hub](https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook-apple-supply-chain-trump-tariffs-china-diversify-iphone-2025-1?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=yahoo.com), with about 85% of its iPhones manufactured there.

""Apple produces basically all their iPhones in China, and the question will be around exceptions and exemptions on this tariff policy if those companies are building more operations, factories, and plants in the US[ like Apple announced in February](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-will-spend-more-than-500-billion-usd-in-the-us-over-the-next-four-years/),"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients following the announcement.

As trade tensions escalate, Apple has moved to increase its supply chain beyond just China, boosting manufacturing in places like India and Vietnam. But with the new tariff announcements set to impact those countries too, there's now limited room for reprieve.

""The worry will be around pricing and margin impacts along with what this means for the global supply chain looking forward,"" Ives said. For now, the analyst continues to believe major negotiations will happen over the coming months as companies attempt to navigate ""this new world of tariffs.""

Until then, he warned, ""tech stocks will clearly be under major pressure.""

Other Magnificent Seven players also faced significant selling action. In aggregate, that cohort of stocks is currently on track to eliminate over $800 billion from their collective market caps.

In afternoon trade, Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)) and Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) each fell 7%, followed by a 6% drop in both Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL)) and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)). Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)) dipped 3%, while Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)) was off just under 2%.

Outside of the Mag Seven, chip stocks faced similar declines, despite the exemption of semiconductors from Trump's additional tariffs. Nvidia competitor Broadcom ([AVGO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AVGO)), for example, erased well over $50 billion from its market cap following an 8% drop in shares.

""The implications \[of the announced tariffs\] are broad-reaching, and we see negative implications for the whole \[chip\] sector,"" KeyBanc analyst John Vinh wrote in a note to clients. ""These are most notably going to negatively impact end-demand in key markets including smartphones/iPhones and PCs, as a significant amount of manufacturing is done within China.""

Stacy Rasgon, Bernstein's managing director and senior analyst, added in an interview with Yahoo Finance that the biggest headwind for semiconductors is not necessarily the direct impact of tariffs. Rather, it's the risk of demand destruction as these products become more expensive.

He added, ""The other risk for semis is that they are very cyclical, very global, and very correlated to the macro and to GDP. [So if this tips us into recession, ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-economy-dangerously-vulnerable-to-recession-wall-street-reacts-to-tariff-fallout-155837444.html)that's probably not going to be great.""",215,63,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jqpre5/apple_sheds_300_billion_in_tarifffueled_selloff/
2025-04-03 13:12:14,Apple,AAPL,Interesting Stocks Today (04/3) - Liberation Day,"Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

**Stay agile, and be on the lookout for tariff news from Beijing.**

News: [Trump's Tariff Announcement](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2025-04-02/trump-s-tariff-announcement)

[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\- 34% tariff on Chinese imports, adding to existing duties, brings the total to 54% effective April 9. AAPL relies heavily on Chinese manufacturing, and these tariffs are expected to lead to increased production costs, which will be passed on to consumers through higher prices. Watching $200, but likely the stock I'm going to play if there's any chance of a bounce (in addition to NVDA). These tariffs will result in retaliatory measures from China, further impacting Apple's supply chain and profitability. Additionally, prolonged tariffs could lower consumer demand due to higher prices. Related Tickers: AVGO, SWKS, TSM, QCOM.

[**CRWV (CoreWeave)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRWV&p=d)\- Google is reportedly in advanced discussions to rent Nvidia's Blackwell AI servers from CoreWeave. This potential partnership is huge because it means that CRWV has a little more diversification in their revenue stream (alleviating a huge risk to the company). It's hard, this has risen so much from the IPO but we're back at pre-tariff and pre-announcement prices- have a small long position but likely will exit due to all the craziness today and need to focus on the bigger fish. Despite Taiwanese chips not being tariffed, CRWV will likely benefit due to the rising costs of chips.

[**RH (Restoration Hardware)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RH&p=d)\- Reported EPS of $1.58 vs $1.92 expected. Revenue of $812M vs $829M. The company issued guidance for the current fiscal year, projecting revenue growth of 10% to 13%, an adjusted operating margin between 14% and 15%, and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 20% to 21%. Management highlighted concerns over a higher-risk business environment due to tariffs, market volatility, and inflation risks, noting that RH has been operating in the ""worst housing market in almost 50 years."" Interested at $150, but won't focus on this today vs AAPL or other Mag7 names that are selling off.

[**VXX (VIX Short-Term Futures ETN)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&p=d)\- The recent spike in volatility attributed to ""Liberation Day"" saw a massive VIX spike along with everything else selling off. Interested in seeing what we do but I doubt today will be the day I take a short position- volatility is coming and is not as likely to be the quick one-day spikes we've seen in the past. We may see additional tariffs from China in retaliation.

[**NKE (Nike)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NKE&p=d)\- Nike is one of the biggest losers due to tariffs, as a substantial portion of its manufacturing is based in Southeast Asian countries facing high tariff rates. Notably, Nike produces nearly 50% of its footwear and 30% of its apparel in Vietnam. Currently long, but will bail if we break new lows (\~$55.20). Prolonged tariffs lead to higher consumer prices, and NKE has cited lowered demand/guidance for its goods due to competitors.

[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\- NVIDIA's exposure to the recent tariff announcements appears limited, as the 32% levy on imports from Taiwan. The White House clarified that semis are exempt from these tariffs, which provides a buffer for NVIDIA's core business and limits downside risk from the new trade measures. We still saw a 6% move post-tariff announcement.",0,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jqi2wj/interesting_stocks_today_043_liberation_day/

2025-03-25 22:14:10,Apple,AAPL,Stocks Close Higher for 3rd Straight Day; Tesla Surges in Late Trading to Extend Rally,"
Major indexes closed slightly higher Tuesday as the stock market continued its recovery from an extended selloff.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite added 0.2% and 0.5%, respectively, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose fractionally. Stocks had kicked off the week with big gains following news that President Trump could scale back some of the tariffs that are due to be imposed next week on U.S. trading partners. With the recent gains, the Dow has inched back into positive territory for 2025, as stocks have rebounded from a month-long selloff spurred by concerns about the potential impact of tariffs and uncertainty about the outlook for the economy.

Investors brushed off consumer confidence data released this morning that came in weaker than expected, with the index hitting its lowest level in more than four years. Investors are closing watching all data points amid worries that tariffs could reignite inflation and cause economic growth to stall. The big economic report of the week comes Friday with the scheduled release of the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which had fallen during the recent stock market rout amid the growing concerns about the economy, was at 4.32% in late trading, down from 4.33% at yesterday's close and from an earlier high Tuesday of 4.37%. The yield, which affects costs on all sorts of loans, notably mortgages, hit its highest level in more than a month this morning.

Mega-cap technology stocks, which helped lead Monday's rally, were mostly higher again today. Shares of Tesla (TSLA) rallied late in the day to finish 3.5% higher, gaining ground for the 5th consecutive session, despite news Tuesday that the EV maker's sales in Europe continued to slide. Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta Platforms (META) each rose more than 1%, while Microsoft (MSFT) inched ahead. Chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) closed slightly lower

2025-03-21 00:54:15,Apple,AAPL,Short sellers have made $15 billion betting against Tesla and Nvidia in 2025,"Short sellers have been cleaning up to start 2025 amid a massive sell-off in some of the market's most popular names over the past two years.

Short sellers have made a combined $15 billion betting against Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) stock thus far this year, according to data from S3 Partners. Tesla shorts alone have raked in nearly $11 billion, while bets against Nvidia have brought in more than $4 billion.

Tesla's 40% year-to-date drop has led the declines of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks. Investors have grown concerned about CEO Elon Musk's focus on government efficiency efforts and how his role with President Trump's administration could be a turnoff to the electric vehicle maker's customer base.

But it hasn't just been Tesla lagging. As an index, the Magnificent Seven — which also includes Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) — is underperforming the S&P 500 this quarter by the most since 2022.

Short sellers have profited off of all of the names in the cohort this year. They've brought in nearly $5 billion betting against Apple stock, which is down nearly 14% in 2025.

The crash in the most popular trade of the past two years comes as investors have been re-rating their growth expectations. Fears of slowing economic growth and the impact of Trump's tariff policies have weighed on markets. Meanwhile, Big Tech has faced growing investor criticism about its ballooning AI spend and whether or not it will eventually boost future profits as much as Wall Street hopes. The year also included a massive drawdown in some large tech names, including Nvidia, following the release of a cheaper AI model from Chinese company DeepSeek.

Now, with most of the names sitting around 20% off their recent 52-week highs, the looming question for markets is whether or not investor appetite for the stocks that led the market higher for the past two years will return.

""Maybe these tech stocks got ahead of their skis a little bit,"" BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski told Yahoo Finance last week. ""But at the end of the day, these are monster companies that define the growth trajectory for the United States stock market. They are not going away.""

2025-03-20 06:08:52,Apple,AAPL,A Deeper Dive on Trump's Tariffs and Market Positioning,"Trump’s latest trade policies are hammering the markets—S&P 500 down \~9%, Nasdaq off \~12%—and it looks like he’s doubling down. Tariffs on China, Canada, Mexico, and the EU are back on the table, with zero indication that he’s backing down. While some sectors (steel, domestic manufacturing) stand to benefit, others (tech, autos, multinational retailers) are getting crushed. The question is: at what point does the market pain force Trump to change course?

The **2025 Trade Policy Agenda** lays out his vision:

✅ **Tariffs as leverage** – forcing trade partners into more “reciprocal” deals

✅ **USMCA review (2026)** – questioning whether Canada & Mexico are benefiting unfairly

✅ **Hardline stance on China** – blaming it for the U.S. trade deficit and pushing for stricter enforcement of trade agreements

His strategy? **Drive U.S. production up, cut reliance on imports, and force foreign partners to play by his rules.** But markets are worried about **inflation, supply chain disruption, and retaliatory tariffs**—all of which are starting to bite.

Not every company is hurting—some stand to **benefit significantly** from Trump’s protectionist approach. Trump’s tariffs **shield domestic manufacturers from foreign competition**, making U.S. steel, aluminum, and energy companies prime beneficiaries. E.g 

* **U.S. Steel** X 25% steel tariffs will boost profits
* **Cleveland-Cliffs** CLF Increased demand for domestic steel
* **Nucor** NUE Largest U.S. steel producer, stronger pricing power
* **Anheuser-Busch** BUD Domestic production = insulated from trade costs
* **Prologis** PLD Companies stockpiling goods = warehouse demand surge
* **Lockheed Martin** LMT Defense spending likely to rise under Trump
* **Marathon Petroleum** MPC Energy independence push favors domestic refiners

Companies with **complex supply chains** and reliance on **overseas production** are getting squeezed by **higher input costs and potential retaliatory tariffs**.E.g

* **Apple** AAPL Major China exposure, supply chain at risk
* **Tesla** TSLA Higher costs across supply chain, could hurt margins
* **General Motors** GM Tariffs on parts increase manufacturing costs
* **Ford** F Supply chain disruptions could impact production
* **Nike** NKE Manufacturing in China = higher import costs
* **Amazon** AMZN Increased cost of goods from global suppliers
* **Boeing** BA Risk of Chinese retaliation cutting aircraft orders 

Are you positioning for a **domestic manufacturing boom**, or do you think **this trade war will spiral into a full-blown recession**? Should we be **buying the dip** in industrials or **shorting overexposed multinationals**?

  
Trump’s strategy is clear: use **tariffs as a multipurpose weapon**, not just for trade but also for **immigration and national security**. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick hinted that **Canada & Mexico could avoid tariffs if they “improve border security” and crack down on fentanyl trafficking**. This suggests Trump is **negotiating in multiple arenas at once**, using economic pressure to force compliance on broader policy goals.

The problem? **Markets hate uncertainty**, and businesses can’t plan if policy keeps shifting based on unrelated factors.

2025-03-19 18:46:11,Apple,AAPL,Apple's 'Siri-Ous' Problem - Here's Why I'm Bearish on AAPL,"Okay, Apple fans (or Cook loyalists), let me finish before you go on a rampage. I'm not putting down Apple's products - the iPhone did change the world, and Siri ...... well, at least the way we interact with our phones. But today, we're talking about stocks, and AAPL is looking more and more like a “shareholder-funded AI experiment”.



Apple's growth is slowing, iPhone sales are weak, and the company's attempts to boost demand with AI features like Apple Intelligence have frequently skipped a beat, with Siri's AI upgrade pushed back to 2026 or possibly even later, and iOS 18's bugs making the user experience even worse. Meanwhile, rivals like Google and Amazon have made significant strides in the AI assistant space.



To make matters worse, Apple's valuation is already ridiculously high, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 29x, well above the S&P 500's 20x. That's clearly unsustainable given its single-digit growth expectations. The irony is that Cook seems to be focusing more on growth in the services business, while innovation in the iPhone as a core product has been weak. So why exactly is this company still worth so much money? How do you see Apple's future? Is it time to reassess its valuation?

2025-03-19 05:55:08,Apple,AAPL,Trump’s Trade War 2.0: The Stocks I’m Watching,"With Trump back in office and tariffs returning in full force, I’ve been analyzing what this means for U.S. equities. His latest moves—25% steel and aluminum tariffs, expanded levies on Chinese imports, and a tariff-heavy negotiation strategy—echo his first term but with even **stronger measures**.



While 2018-2020 gave us some clues, the market setup in 2025 is **different**:

• **Higher inflation & rates:** Tariffs add inflationary pressure, making the Fed’s job harder.

• **China’s response will change:** Unlike in 2018, China now **dominates EV battery production** and **controls rare earth supply chains**—this could hurt U.S. tech more than before.

• **Supply chain resilience is mixed:** Companies have talked about reshoring for years, but it’s still expensive and slow.

Given these factors, here’s how I’m positioning:

**Likely Winners:**

1. **Steel & Aluminum (NUE, STLD, CLF)** – Tariffs give them pricing power, though cost inflation is a risk.

2. **Defense & Cybersecurity (LMT, PLTR, CRWD)** – “America First” likely means **higher defense budgets**.

3. **Regional Banks (JPM, BAC, GS)** – If deregulation follows, these should gain.

4. **Domestic Infrastructure (CAT, DE, OSK)** – If tariffs hurt foreign suppliers, U.S. construction demand rises.



**Likely Losers:**

1. **Tech Giants (AAPL, NVDA, QCOM, INTC)** – Heavy China exposure = supply chain and revenue risks.

2. **Consumer Goods (NKE, WMT, DG)** – Imports get pricier, and passing costs to lower-income customers is tough.

3. **Auto & Industrial (TSLA, GM, F, MMM)** – Higher input costs + China retaliation = pain.

4. **Agri Exporters (ADM, TSN, BG)** – If China targets U.S. farm products again, these get hit.



**What I’m watching:**

📌 Will China retaliate with rare earth metal export bans? (Impacts TSLA, NVDA, QCOM)

📌 Do inflation expectations rise, pushing Fed policy hawkish? (Bad for rate-sensitive stocks)

📌 Does Trump backtrack on any tariffs? (A la 2019)

📌 Will domestic manufacturing gains **outweigh** supply chain disruptions?

I’d love to hear counterpoints. Which stocks do you think will **outperform or underperform** in Trump’s Trade War 2.0?",254,187,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jeqaup/trumps_trade_war_20_the_stocks_im_watching/

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2025-03-11 17:12:13,Apple,AAPL,Trump's DOJ wants a Google breakup but is willing to leave AI alone,"President Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, now largely agree on a major point that has the potential to reshape the tech world: Google should be broken up.

But there is an important difference that emerged in a filing last Friday: Trump’s Justice Department wants to let Google (GOOG, GOOGL) keep its investments in artificial intelligence. It notably has a stake in OpenAI rival Anthropic worth billions.

Backing off the Biden administration's request to force Google to sell off its AI bets was ""significant"" and ""very justified,"" said Mark McCareins, a business law professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management.

It ""may be an indication that the government worries about deterring AI advances in the global race with China,"" added David Olson, associate law professor at Boston College Law School.

The stock of Google's parent, Alphabet, dropped more than 4% Monday as other tech stocks also sold off on macroeconomic concerns.

The final decision on what happens to Google's $2 trillion empire in court will be in the hands of federal judge Amit Mehta, who ruled last August that Google illegally monopolized online markets for ""general search"" and ""general search text.”

No matter what Mehta decides, Google is expected to appeal, and the DOJ can too. Hearings to decide on remedies in this case are slated for April and May.

Final remedy recommendations from the government and Google were due to the judge Friday, giving a Trump-led DOJ one last chance to alter the prior Biden-era suggestion to the judge that Google be broken up with the forced sale of Google’s Chrome browser or contingent sale of its Android operating system.

It didn’t do so, despite being lobbied by the company to reconsider the Chrome proposal on national security concerns.

""Google must divest the Chrome browser — an important search access point,"" the DOJ stated in its final proposal on Friday.

It argued that under a different owner, new rivals would have an “opportunity to operate a significant gateway to search the internet, free of Google’s monopoly control.”

They also retained part of a request to leave the door open to a possible divestiture of Google's Android operating system.

But prosecutors did drop the Biden DOJ's push for Google to sell off its AI bets, instead suggesting a setup where federal authorities could keep tabs on proposed AI investments that could threaten search competition.

Anthropic has argued to the judge that forcing Google to relinquish its stake would tilt the AI playing field in favor of OpenAI and its backer, Microsoft (MSFT).

“Plaintiffs no longer seek the mandatory divestiture of Google’s AI investments,” the DOJ said Friday in its revised proposal.

Derek Mountford, a shareholder in Gunster's business litigation practice group who specializes in antitrust litigation, said while the Trump administration's AI rollback is a concession, it comes with a hook.

""They're asking for some reporting requirements to be attached to it,"" he said.

""I think one of the [antitrust] themes you might see in a second Trump administration is even if they're walking back some of the proposed sanctions, there's still that element of control and monitoring and enforcement that's going on in the background.""

The tension for the Trump administration, Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich told Yahoo Finance last week, is that it is engaged in an existential fight with China for the future of AI and Google can still be an important weapon for the US.

""What are we going to do, hobble one of our main US runners in that race by breaking up that company?” asked Kovacevich, who previously led Google's US policy strategy and external affairs team.

""It seems ill-timed to do that.""

The DOJ did stick with another expected remedy proposal that strikes at a major contention in the case.

It asked the judge to block Google from contracts that secure its search engine as the default across dozens of internet-connected devices, such as mobile phones made by Apple (AAPL), Samsung, and others, and browsers, including Apple’s Safari and Mozilla’s Firefox.

That is not good news for Apple, jeopardizing a major revenue stream. In 2021, Google paid $26 billion for default search placements, and the lion's share of that went to Apple.

Bernstein analysts have estimated Apple’s revenue from Google Search defaults is somewhere between $18 billion and $20 billion per year.

Google countered the DOJ’s request on Friday by asking that it still be free to enter into contracts to make Google search a default — so long as it does not condition search licensing based on device manufacturers also agreeing to distribute, preload, place, display, use, or license its AI Gemini Assistant Application.

McCareins, the law professor at Kellogg, said the DOJ has little to lose at this stage by holding on to Chrome divestment as a negotiating chip, given that both the underlying case and the judge's decision on remedies are subject to appeal.

""Just from a bargaining negotiating position, at this stage of the proceedings, I am not shocked or stunned that the new sheriffs in town have continued to argue for divestiture of Chrome,"" McCareins said.

2025-03-03 15:52:45,Apple,AAPL,"Trump, Chip Maker TSMC Expected to Announce $100 Billion Investment in U.S.","WASHINGTON—Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. 2330 -1.92%decrease; red down pointing triangle intends to invest $100 billion in chip-manufacturing plants in the U.S. over the next four years under a plan expected to be announced later Monday by President Trump, according to people familiar with the matter.

The investment would be used to build out cutting-edge chip-making facilities. Such an expansion would advance a long-pursued U.S. goal to regrow the domestic semiconductor industry after manufacturing fled largely to Asian countries in recent decades.

TSMC, the world’s largest contract chip-maker, set down roots in Arizona in 2020, when it said it would build a chip factory there for $12 billion. Its ambitions for the site have expanded rapidly since, with two more factories on the same site and a total investment of $65 billion. The company’s first factory began mass production late last year.

TSMC’s announcement comes after years of deliberation regarding the future of semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. and the global tech sector. The company currently builds its most advanced chip-making facilities only on its home soil Taiwan. The chips it produces are critical for powering everything from the latest artificial-intelligence systems to smartphones.

Since the Biden administration, the U.S. has expressed concerns about TSMC’s near-monopoly on advanced chip manufacturing and has been urging the company to relocate more of its cutting-edge production, including advanced chip-packaging facilities, to the U.S. Advanced chip packaging is particularly critical for AI-related chips, as it enhances performance by integrating multiple semiconductor components, reducing size, improving power efficiency, and ensuring faster data transfer—key factors for AI applications.

[awarded up to $6.6 billion of grants](https://www.wsj.com/tech/taiwanese-chip-making-giant-tsmc-gets-6-6-billion-for-arizona-project-f75e9de4?mod=article_inline), and has recently begun to receive federal money from the program. Generous tax credits have also boosted chip-making projects in the U.S.

“We’re pleased to have an opportunity to meet with the President and look forward to discussing our shared vision for innovation and growth in the semiconductor industry, as well as exploring ways to bolster the technology sector along with our customers,” TSMC said in a statement.

U.S. officials see chip-making as a national-security imperative because economies, technological advancement and military might all are increasingly dependent on who has the best chips. Covid-era supply-chain issues also highlighted the critical nature of the industry when shortages of chips led to slowdowns in auto sales, among other disruptions.

Trump has repeatedly called for more chip manufacturing in the U. S.—although he criticized the Chips Act on the campaign trail and argued the better way to attract manufacturing was through tariffs. Last month, he said he was considering a 25% or more tariff on semiconductor imports.

“We have to have chips made in this country. Right now, everything is made in Taiwan, practically, almost all of it, a little bit in South Korea, but everything—almost all of it is made in Taiwan. And we want it to be made—we want those companies to come to our country, in all due respect,” Trump said in February.

Since taking office, Trump has appeared at the White House with the chief executives of several companies to announce pledges to invest in the U.S. The details of the projects are often vague and it is often unclear whether the pledges represent [new investments by the companies](https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-corporate-new-job-investment-what-to-expect-ad19993c?mod=article_inline).

OpenAI’s Sam Altman, database company [Oracle](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/ORCL) and investment giant [SoftBank Group](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/JP/XTKS/9984) pledged to invest as much as $500 billion into building artificial-intelligence infrastructure in the U.S., though Trump adviser [Elon Musk](https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/elon-musk) has questioned whether the project would come to fruition.

Last week, [Apple](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AAPL) said it plans to [spend more than $500 billion](https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-500-billion-investment-us-19ca11a0?mod=article_inline) over the next four years to expand its manufacturing footprint in the U.S.

I have kept a close eye on this subreddit for the last 10-15 years and have always been amazed by how ahead of the curve we are. Here is a list of stocks that have been heavily discussed over the years that have performed very well: 

- Tesla 
- Shopify 
- Block
- NVDA 
- AMD 
- PLTR
- AAPL 
- GME

I know everyone in the comments is going to claim this is selection bias, but I can assure you these stocks were talked about so much it is unmistakable. People will also claim but these stocks have tanked since then! They have had significant corrections, but if you bought them when the buzz began you are still significantly in the green.  We will have to wait and see what the future holds. 

 But what about the losers like movie pass!? Of course, some losers have been overly hyped too, but they are far less common. Also, in my opinion, the tone around stocks like movie pass is totally different than a stock like NVDA or SHOP. 

The beautiful part about Reddit is you hear both sides, SHOP had a great deal of resistance back in 2017 and still does. A lot of people claimed it was a worthless company. People like Andrew Left were worshipped for shorting the company. But at the end of the day it was posted about non stop and has performed extremely well. People were also screaming from the top of the mountain that NVDA was overpriced in 2017, look where that ended up. 

Lately it feels like we have entered a new “hype” cycle where a lot of new names have been heavily mentioned. Similar to the hype cycle of 2016-2017 there is a lot of resistance and great discussions behind had. Here are some new names that I have noticed being posted about non stop: 

- RKLB
- IONQ 
- BBAI
- CAVA 
- LUNR
- SMCI
- OKLO 
- BRO

I have been seeing these tickers fly around lately and see a lot of promise in them. They have performed very well in the past 6 months to a year, but we will have to wait and see where they end up in the long term. 

It’s a common meme to short every stock Reddit mentions, but I ultimately disagree. The hive mind is a very powerful and can seemingly predict the future. Keep in mind, the hive mind is what sets the vegas spreads. 

Anyway, that’s my rant for the day. I am sure 75% of you will disagree with me, but again, thats why I love Reddit. Would love to hear your opinions. 

Also, I have holdings in most of the companies listed. This is not financial advice. Do your own due diligence before buying any company I listed. ",0,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1izi0k0/reddit_picks_winners/
2025-02-25 11:48:08,Apple,AAPL,On Market Timing,"You cannot time the market, but there are times when it is due for a crash. At those times you definitely don’t want to buy on the dips, and you want to sell a bit more on the rips. Major market declines can happen really fast (think of the flash crash), but major declines like 2000 and 2008 give you notice that they’re coming. **Crashes occur when a majority of investors are just wrong about something big.** If you want to make money on stocks over the long run, it’s good to see the crashes coming. I’m pretty sure that one is coming now. I'm a successful investor with 30 years in equities. Let me review my experience in the dot com crash and the 2008 financial crisis.

I started investing significantly in 1996, when I got a better paying job. It was fun. You could identify new technologies and hold on for meteoric rise. I made a lot on IOM and AFFX. But it was clear that the market did not actually understand the internet. A company could double its market capitalization by getting a web site and renaming itself a dot com. Valuations reflected the mistaken idea that doing exactly the same business online was somehow going to be much more profitable. I remember realizing that I owned stocks that were worth far more than the underlying value of the company, but kept going up. I developed a rule (sell a third every time it triples) to get my money back while continuing to profit from the insanity. When things started to turn south, it didn’t take a genius to get out. When the bleeding stopped, I was early to get back in, looking for stocks that found support (low volume on down days) during the crash. Among the stocks I bought in 2001, I’ve done the best with AAPL.

The other big bear market I went through was 2008. Again, the fall can be traced to something that the majority of investors had wrong. I remember talking to a mortgage broker in 2004. They were pushing balloon mortgages and other nonsense that allowed people to buy houses they could not afford. I asked about the terms, and realized that shit would hit the fan in 2007 or 2008. It was not hard to see. There were a lot of these mortgages. As a homeowner, I got cold calls inviting me to refinance my 30 year fixed with something that would have a lower rate for a few years before exploding. Again, the economy was headed in the wrong direction because the market somehow thought these were safe. I can’t claim to have seen the crash coming (I thought the damage would be limited to foolish homeowners), but leveraged collateralized mortgage obligations set financial markets up for a fall. My point is that, once again, the market fell because the market was just wrong about something, and eventually reality could no longer be ignored.

We’re here again. A lot of people think Trump/DOGE will be good for business. Taxes will be cut and government waste eliminated. They do not understand how the parts of government being eliminated are good for business. I’ll give you three examples. First, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has been eliminated, or at least crippled. The idea is that less regulation is a good thing. But without that protection, more consumers are going to be subject to scams, and the more sophisticated are not going to use services like X Money at all, because they are no longer safe. Second, there have been huge cuts to funding for science (NIH, USDA, NSF, etc.) with almost no attempt to identify what spending is actually wasteful. Innovation comes from science, so this will be very very bad for business over the long run. Third, DOGE cancelled legal contracts for government services with no warning. Even if you think that providing services to refugees is wasteful, it’s not fraudulent, and the American businesses who had those contracts were obviously hurt, as was trust in the government. 

Is it too late to avoid disaster? Maybe not, but I don’t see Donald Trump saying “oops” anytime soon.

So, we’re there again. The market will fall because the market is wrong about something big.

2025-02-23 17:46:53,Apple,AAPL,"Warren Buffett sounds warning to Washington as Berkshire reports record profit, cash","https://www.reuters.com/business/warren-buffett-says-us-should-spend-wisely-plans-increase-investment-japan-2025-02-22/?utm_source=reddit.com

NEW YORK, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), opens new tab on Saturday reported record annual profits and boosting its cash stake to $334.2 billion, as Warren Buffett used his annual shareholder letter to caution Washington to spend money wisely and take care of those who get the ""short straws in life.""

Buffett's admonition came as many investors worry U.S. lawmakers won't rein in soaring fiscal deficits, and could make them worse by extending tax cuts backed by President Donald Trump.

The 94-year-old Buffett, the world's sixth-richest person and arguably its most famous investor, also acknowledged his advanced age, telling shareholders he uses a cane and will spend less time fielding their questions at Berkshire's annual meeting on May 3.

He nonetheless assured shareholders they would be in good hands after he turns over the conglomerate's reins to Vice Chairman Greg Abel, saying the 62-year-old Abel has ""vividly shown his ability"" to deploy capital.

""It won't be long"" before Abel takes over, Buffett said.

Buffett's letter was accompanied by Berkshire's annual report, where it reported a third straight record annual operating profit, rising 27% to $47.44 billion.

Quarterly operating profit rose 71% to $14.53 billion, also a record, and which analysts viewed as solid.

Net income for the full year totaled $89 billion, including gains from Berkshire's common stock investments such as Apple (AAPL.O), opens new tab and American Express (AXP.N), opens new tab.

Berkshire's cash stake reflected high business valuations and nine straight quarters of selling more stocks than it bought. The selling included Apple, which remained its largest stock investment.

""Often, nothing looks compelling; very infrequently we find ourselves knee-deep in opportunities,"" Buffett wrote.

'FISCAL FOLLY'

This year is Buffett's 60th at the helm of Berkshire, which he transformed from a failing textile company into a $1.03 trillion conglomerate with dozens of businesses in insurance, railroad, energy, industrial, retail and other sectors.

""Berkshire's activities now impact all corners of our country. And we are not finished,"" Buffett said.

Buffett said Berkshire will continue preferring equities, primarily U.S. stocks, over cash, even as it resists paying a dividend to shareholders, which it has not done since 1967.

He said reinvesting in Berkshire is one reason the Omaha, Nebraska-based company paid $26.8 billion of federal taxes last year, 5% of all payments by corporate America. Buffett himself is worth $149.5 billion, Forbes magazine said,
But he also sent a cautionary message to Washington, lamenting how capitalism ""has its faults and abuses--in certain respects more egregious now than ever,"" with malfeasance by ""scoundrels and promoters"" in full force.

He urged lawmakers to help preserve a stable U.S. dollar, saying ""fiscal folly"" can destroy the value of paper money and the country has at times ""come close to the edge.""

Buffett said long-term success of Berkshire and the American economy, which he called the ""American miracle,"" has depended on people's ability to participate.

That, he said, is something Uncle Sam can encourage, or take away.

""Take care of the many who, for no fault of their own, get the short straws in life. They deserve better,"" Buffett wrote, addressing the government.
""And never forget that we need you to maintain a stable currency and that result requires both wisdom and vigilance on your part,"" he added.

Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research who rates Berkshire ""hold,"" said: ""Talking about the business of America being messy was his way of addressing the political landscape and its impact on the macroeconomic environment. He is warning Washington: Be careful where you tread.""

FEWER BUYING OPPORTUNITIES

While Berkshire has not made a major purchase of an entire company since 2016, Buffett said it is likely to increase its combined $23.5 billion of investments in five Japanese trading houses: Itochu (8001.T), opens new tab, Marubeni (8002.T), opens new tab, Mitsubishi (8058.T), opens new tab, Mitsui (8031.T), opens new tab and Sumitomo (8053.T), opens new tab.

Other stocks appear pricey, with the Standard & Poor's 500 (.SPX), opens new tab hitting a new high on Wednesday and the Nasdaq (.IXIC), opens new tab just 3% below its December 16 peak.

Berkshire's size also inhibits its shares from trouncing the indexes, as they did decades ago.
The company's stock price has risen 15% in the last year, while the Standard & Poor's 500 rose 18%.

Over the last decade, Berkshire's stock price has risen 225%, while the index rose 241% including dividends and 185% excluding dividends, Reuters data show.

""They will have lots of buying opportunities but Berkshire will never be the large double-digit compounder it had been,"" said Bill Smead, chief investment officer at Smead Capital Management in Phoenix.

At Berkshire's annual meeting, Buffett will spend less time on the stage in a downtown Omaha arena where he, Abel and Vice Chairman Ajit Jain will answer shareholder questions.

Tens of thousands of people attend the meeting and a weekend of shareholder events, including shopping.

Buffett told Fortune magazine last month that he was still having fun and able to do a few things reasonably well, while other activities had been ""eliminated or greatly minimized.""

The meeting will also not feature the traditional movie created by Buffett's daughter Susie.
In discussing his age, Buffett said he talks regularly on Sundays with his 91-year-old sister Bertie, using an old-fashioned phone.

""We cover the joys of old age and discuss such exciting topics as the relative merits of our canes,"" he said. ""In my case, the utility is limited to the avoidance of falling flat on my face.""

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Palantir has been on a tear recently, all hyped up on the defense sector growth but no one is really paying attention to Meta Defense and their entry to the space. Last year Meta opened up its AI models to defense agencies and contractors. This is huge for them to get this level of clearance and i think this will will put them in direct competition with Palantir. Im not sure how they build out this branch of Meta, Im calling it Meta Defense but they fired all their woke people and are starting to re-shape the company.

Yes, there is defense spending cuts but its all on waste and overcharged contracts not on things that actually matter for the dept of defense. During the inauguration Zuckerberg was in the front row, Hegseth was somewhere in the back. Just an observation.

Everyone is familiar with their social media business so there isnt a whole lot to talk about there. AI keeps improving, More growth from Reels, Threads, Facebook. Their LLM is impressive and arguably one of the best, putting them up there with OpenAI.

With all there user data they have Meta Analytics could be another source of revenue.

They are sitting on a goldmine with Facebook market place. i get they have ads but i feel they could do more.  Im not sure Zuckerberg realized what he has there but this business if monetized right could be HUGE.

2025-02-17 15:53:25,Apple,AAPL,Foreign Exchange Impacts on Apple's Earnings,"**Foreign Exchange Impacts on Apple**

The US dollar (USDXY) can have a huge impact on Apple’s revenue and earnings as around 50% of Apple’s sales occur internationally. Much of the past ten years the USDXY has hovered in the 92-98 range. When COVID-19 hit in March 2020, the Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds rate and the USDXY hovered in the 89-95 range for a majority of the second half of 2021 through early 2022. In early 2022 the Federal reserve started to hike the federal funds rate and did so through the end of 2023. From mid-2022 through today the USDXY has hovered in the 103-113 range. This is is a 10-25% difference. The elevated USDXY poses significant revenue headwinds for Apple as it costs Apple much more to convert back to US dollars on foreign revenue and it also can lead to lower sales volume as Apple has to raise prices in foreign countries to help offset a strong USDXY. A strong USDXY can help Apple when it comes to foreign investment and international expenses, but the revenue and sales impact outweighs any gains in the cost area. Tim Cook cites in Apple’s Q1 2023 earnings call that foreign exchange (FX) impacts had a “nearly 800 basis point impact,” on revenue. In Apple’s latest Q1 2025 earnings call Tim Cook stated that FX would have a negative 2.5% impact on revenue, but that is YoY not compared to 2021 meaning on a constant currency basis compared to 2021 it would be close to the 6-8% range. Below is a five-year chart of the USDXY. Let’s take a look at Apple’s fiscal year 2024 performance with a 6% constant currency adjustment to revenue to compare to FY 2021 on a constant currency basis.

**FY 2024 Example**

Apple’s total net sales in FY 2024 was $391 billion. With a constant currency 6% adjustment it would be $415 billion. Apple’s total cost of sales for FY 2024 was $210 billion. If we add in a 6% negative impact for a weakened USDXY it would be $223 billion. This would mean Apple’s gross margins would have been 52.8% instead of the reported 46.2% for FY 2024. Apple’s adjusted diluted EPS for FY 2024 would have been around $7.55/share vs the reported $6.75 adjusting for the one-tax payment made in Q4 2024. Here is the math:

Revenue: $415 billion

Cost of Sales: $223 billion

Operation Expenses: $57.5 billion

Effective Tax Rate: 15.8%

Total Outstanding Shares: \~15 billion

($415 -$223)=gross margin -($57.5) = operating income \*(15.8%)= ($113.25)/15=$7.55

As you can see, FY 2024 EPS would have been 12% higher on a constant currency basis compared to FY 2021. Gross margin would have been 660 basis points higher. The strong USDXY has a significant impact on Apple’s earnings. I think the second half of FY 2025 FY 2026 could be a big growth year for Apple on paper if the USDXY weakens and Apple’s hardware replacement cycle follows its normal 3–4-year cycle. The last big upgrade cycle took place during the end of 2020-2021.

My thought process is as follows (again, only considering non-dividend stocks): 

The only thing moving the needle is speculation. If AAPL made 1bil more than expected, the stock doesn’t move until the information is available and people start speciation whether it’s good to buy/sell this information. 

Since all the money is just a pooled from the traders, it’s zero sum? It’s not a zero sum wager (winning from another’s loss) but it certainly sounds like zero sum 

Say a stock has 10 investors each having $100 invested. The moment 1/2 of them cash out, the other 1/2 would be left with $50 each, cuz money got taken from the pool and no new money came in

2025-02-12 18:49:43,Apple,AAPL,"Apple Interested In Making Humanoid Robot, Top Analyst Says","Source: Investor Business Daily reporting on Twitter post.

A top Apple (AAPL) stock analyst says the consumer electronics giant is mulling whether to make a humanoid robot.

In a post on social network X on Wednesday, TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said Apple is exploring both humanoid and nonhumanoid robots as part of its future smart-home ecosystem.

""These products are still in the early proof-of-concept (POC) stage internally,"" Kuo said. ""Given current progress and typical development cycles, Apple's robot mass production likely won't start until 2028 or later.""

""Interestingly, Apple has been unusually open about sharing some of its robotics research during the early POC stage — possibly to attract talent,"" he added.

Kuo cautioned that Apple is still very early in the product development cycle. The proof-of-concept stage is a ""testing ground"" used to determine whether core technologies and product ideas are viable before proceeding.

Apple's rumored foldable iPhone is also in the proof-of-concept stage, he said.

""However, many projects never progress beyond POC — the Apple Car is probably the most notable example of a project that got stuck at this stage,"" Kuo said.",30,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1inyfc8/apple_interested_in_making_humanoid_robot_top/

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2025-01-31 16:46:00,Apple,AAPL,"AAPL - 26,527.62% return over 25 years","Today to the day is the anniversary of twenty five years of my first purchase of AAPL shares.  I bought 1200 dollars worth.

In early 2000, I had just graduated college.  I had a few thousand given to me as an inheritance that was being managed by a broker.

 I asked the broker about purchasing some Apple shares, and he was unimpressed, and unmoved. I was annoyed at him. Apple was the one I had the strongest impulse to purchase.

 Why apple? I had gone from being skeptical of Apple. My  college was very heavily Mac, but I had PCs.  I was unimpressed at the OS, but I was struck by people’s reactions to Jobs.  He was enthusiastic, and I liked the cut of the jib who liked the cut of his jib. I was drawn to the elitism of the people to the brand, and felt it could bounce back. This was even before iPods, mind you, before OS X.  

These were the days of the dotcom boom. This broker was taking like 500 bucks for every trade. This felt unfair, in light of the great digital democratization that was in progress, I wanted the power.  And E*trade was relatively new and it seemed legit.  I hadn’t done anything like this before, I was just a kid, really, but I decided to just go for it. 

I sold most of the shares I inherited, and threw 1200 bucks into Apple.  `(also a few other, less impressive stocks)' I did marvelously the first few months as the market soared, as did most people. 

And…. it  came tumbling down in April 2000.  Disillusioned, I decided not to try to reposition my shares, and I just let things ride for a few months.  When I rebalanced by portfolio, I kept my apple shares, which had split, despite the pull-back.

Every year, I would consider would I buy more apple now?  And it didn't occurr me to sell. Apple often seemed almost comically undervalued, and I held on or increased my investment in it.

Every time apple goes up 1 point, I get more than my initial investment back. Why? Splits.

•	2-for-1 split in 2000  
•	2-for-1 split in 2005  
•	7-for-1 split in 2014  
•	4-for-1 split in 2020

Nowadays cost basis: .88 cents.     As of today that investment has grown 26,527.62%. I added more and more apple across the years, and had some other lucky calls (my second largest holding is NVDA) but no move matches that whimsical lucky move of 25 years ago today.

The security that owning these securities has offered me is significant.  It has let me have a job that isn’t that well-payed and support my family with emergencies being take of by extra funds. We own a lot of apple products, because with the dividends, it sort of just pays for them.

I do think it’s good to give early adults access to a few thousand dollars to play the market and plan to do that with my own children.  Although I didn’t sell my shares, what I did do is convert a bunch of them to a donor advised fund (avoiding taxes, whee), and I give to charity from that for annual giving, and that feels like a win win win proposition.  

I do feel overexposed in AAPL and NVDA, but due to still hopefully having another at least 25 years to go in my life is that pullbacks eventually come back up. The biggest principle that has guided my investing is “Don’t buy crap if you can help it”, and that's my advice to new investors.",990,139,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iej3mb/aapl_2652762_return_over_25_years/

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments.

The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

Catalyst I'm looking out for today- NVDA CEO to meet with White House officials, and server capex cost for DeepSeek estimated to be almost $1.3B. Deepseek capabilities are expected to be copied by US firms.

News: [Fed's Favored Inflation Gauge Posted Muted Advance In December](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-31/fed-s-favored-inflation-gauge-posted-muted-advance-in-december)

Ticker: [AAPL (Apple Inc.)](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)

Catalyst: Apple reported EPS of $2.40 vs. $2.35, and revenue of $124.3B vs 124B.

Despite these positive results, the company provided cautious guidance for the upcoming quarter, citing uncertainties related to the impact of new AI features on sales. Tim Cook mentioned that Apple Intelligence DID lead to stronger sales/growth in areas where it was rolled out (it has limited rollout right now).

Volume/Market Cap/Technicals: Watching $250 level, no strong bias. We've seen AAPL swing close to 20% this month, (on report of sales weakness in China) but doubt this will continue.

Context: Most immediate news that comes to mind was the weakness of sales in China for the iPhone, causing the move this month.

Risks: Don't really see immediate risks beyond the trade war, in 2019/2020 this resulted in AAPL moving manufacturing/production to other countries in South East Asia- slowing growth in China has been pretty consistent, however.

Related Tickers: rest of FAANG, Samsung if you can trade overseas stocks, the various phone component manufacturers that trade with AAPL

Offhand: Apple is investing in its own high-speed network infrastructure to enhance content delivery, (just like META's undersea pipeline)

Ticker: [ACMR (ACM Research, Inc.)](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ACMR&p=d)

Catalyst: Kerrisdale Capital released a bullish report on ACM Research (ACMR), a semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment (WFE) company positioned in China but headquartered in America.

It leads China as a leading supplier of wafer cleaning tools and beneficiary of China's push toward semiconductor self-sufficiency.

Kerrisdale predicts the company to eventually compete globally and cites it as a potential 10x return. Trades at 1x 2025E revenue (likely due to China fears).

Volume/Market Cap/Technicals: This is the interesting part- ACMR holds a $1.2B mkt cap but trades at a massive discount compared to its Chinese subsidiary (ACMS), which has a $5.9 billion market cap and trades at 6x 2025E revenue.

The report suggests that ACMR’s NASDAQ valuation is severely mispriced and could re-rate significantly as investors recognize the valuation gap.

Context: China/US chip war, you guys know what this is.

Sector Context: The global semiconductor industry is shifting, with China attempting to localize chip production.

Kerrisdale argues that restrictions on U.S. and Japanese WFE exports to China will only fuel ACMR’s growth as Chinese fabs increasingly turn to domestic suppliers.

China's WFE self-sufficiency has grown from 4% in 2019 to 17% in 2024 and is expected to reach 36% by 2026.

Risks: Geopolitical factors, including further U.S. export restrictions, could impact ACMR’s operations. Similar to how we have the NVDA trade restriction going on right now. However, Kerrisdale sees these restrictions as a net positive due to ACMR having less competition in China as a result. There are other players in the WFE space in China, but ACMR has a technological moat.

Ticker: [INTC](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=INTC&p=d)

Catalyst: Intel reported revenue of $14.26B vs exp of $13.81B. Most important, the company anticipated breakeven EPS next quarter.

Volume/Market Cap/Technicals: Somewhat rangebound for the past 3 months. Watching $20 but nothing interesting I'm watching beyond that.

Context: This earnings report is Intel's first since the departure of CEO Pat Gelsinger. Right now INTC is being led by two interim co-CEOs, and another price catalyst that could potentially happen is someone competent being picked lol. Also worth thinking of the NVDA/Deepseek/semiconductor news when reading through these catalysts.

Intel has also announced a delay in its Falcon Shores GPU and only using it internally within the company.

Risks: Intel faces significant competition from companies such as NVIDIA and AMD, the delay of their chip is pretty bad news.

Related Tickers: AMD/NVDA/TSM

Ticker: [ASTS](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASTS&p=d)

Catalyst: ASTS has received special temporary authority from the FCC to test its space-based cellular broadband network in the United States. Allows for collaboration efforts with VZ/T.

Volume/Market Cap/Technicals: Slight rise, but will watch this at open to see if volume comes in.

Context: The FCC's authorization allows ASTS to provide cell/satellite comms, allowing for greater coverage and signals that more use of ASTS satellites. I remember that the company was essentially valued based on each satellite they launched successfully in 2024, whether that hype returns remains to be seen but overall not interested in trading this unless we have retail interest again.

Sector Context: SpaceX's Starlink is also entering the direct-to-cell market, as I noted a few days ago- most of the investment that can be done in these type of cell/sat comms in public markets can really only be done in ASTS.

Risks: If SpaceX IPOs we might see a selloff in this stock simply because SpaceX is far larger/established and Elon Musk has closer ties to the government.

2025-01-30 21:36:03,Apple,AAPL,"Apple misses on iPhone revenue, sees 11% drop in China sales","Apple’s overall revenue rose by 4% in the first quarter, but it missed on Wall Street’s iPhone sales expectations and saw sales in China decline 11.1%, the company reported on Thursday. 

Here’s how Apple did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ending Dec. 28. 

Earnings per share: $2.40 vs. $2.35 estimated 

Revenue: $124.30 billion vs. $124.12 billion estimated 

 iPhone revenue: $69.14 billion vs. $71.03 billion estimated 

Mac revenue: $8.99 billion vs. $7.96 billion estimated 

iPad revenue: $8.09 billion vs. $7.32 billion estimated 

Other Products revenue: $11.75 billion vs. $12.01 billion estimated 

Services revenue: $26.34 billion vs. $26.09 billion estimated 

Gross margin: 46.9% vs. 46.5% estimated 

 Although Apple’s overall sales rose during the quarter, the company’s closely watched iPhone sales actually declined slightly on a year-over-year basis. The December quarter is the first full quarter with iPhone 16 sales, and Apple released its Apple Intelligence AI suite for the devices during the quarter.  

Apple’s iPhone miss versus LSEG estimates was the biggest for the company in two years, since its first-quarter earnings report in fiscal 2023. At the time, Apple said that its miss was because it was unable to make enough iPhone 14 models because of production issues in China. 

The company saw significant weakness in Greater China, which includes the mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Overall China sales declined 11.1% during the quarter to $18.51 billion. It’s the largest drop in China sales since the same quarter last year when they fell 12.9%. 

Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC’s Steve Kovach that iPhone sales were stronger in countries where Apple Intelligence is available. Currently, the software is only available in a handful of English-speaking countries, and it isn’t accessible in China or in Chinese. 

“During the December quarter, we saw that in markets where we had rolled out Apple intelligence, that the year-over-year performance on the iPhone 16 family was stronger than those markets where we had not rolled out Apple intelligence,” Cook said.  

Cook told CNBC that there were three factors in the company’s China performance. He said that half of the 11.1% decline was due to a change in “channel inventory,” the fact that Apple Intelligence hasn’t launched in the region and that after the quarter ended, China issued a national subsidy that would stimulate some Apple product sales.  

“If you look at the negative 11, half of the decline is due to a change in channel inventory, and so the operational performance is better,” Cook said. 

Apple executives usually give some color about how the current quarter is shaping up on a call with analysts. Wall Street is expecting guidance for the March quarter of $1.66 in earnings per share on $95.46 billion in revenue. 

The company reported $36.33 billion in net income during the quarter, up 7.1% from $33.92 billion in the same period last year. 

Apple’s iPad and Mac sales showed strong growth over last year’s struggling sales in the holiday quarter. Mac revenue rose 15% to $8.98 billion and iPad revenue grew 15% to $8.08 billion. 

The company released new Macs during the quarter, including new iMac, Mac Mini and MacBook Pro laptops in October, partially contributing to the growth. Apple also launched a new iPad Mini during the quarter. Cook attributed the growth to the new products.  

“It’s driven by the significant excitement around our latest Mac lineup,” Cook said.  

Apple’s profit engine, its Services division, which includes subscriptions, warranties and licensing deals, reported $23.12 billion in revenue, which is 14% higher than the same period last year. Cook said that the company had over 1 billion subscriptions, which includes both direct subscriptions for services like Apple TV+ and iCloud, as well as subscriptions to third-party apps through the company’s App Store system.  

The company’s “other products” category, also called Wearables, which includes Apple Watch, AirPods, Beats and Vision Pro sales, declined 2% on a year-over-year basis to $11.75 billion in sales. 

Apple said it would pay a dividend of 25 cents per share and spent $30 billion on dividends and share repurchases during the first quarter.

The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

**Today OpenAI may make history. Trying out longer form, more detailed catalyst examinations over the short-form with more tickers.**

**Ticker:** [**META (Meta Inc)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=META&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Reported earnings of $8.02 vs $6.68 expected. Revenue of $48.4B vs $47B,but guided revenue short of consensus and didn't provide FY25 revenue outlook (which triggered the reason for the selloff post-earnings after the close).

Their CAPEX announcement was $60-65B vs $52.4B expected, and stated they expected the single largest driver of expesive growth in 2025 as infrastructure costs due to higher OpEX and depreciation.

Also announced plans to grow META's AI team significantly.

**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** Earnings move the stock on far less volume but the initial selloff after announcement was worth trading- interested in the $700 level today but not much beyond that.

**Context:** Decent earnings but signals that there is more spending on the horizon- likely that the initial brutal selloff to $606 was from algos just reading the initial eye-popping CAPEX number and selling the company.

**Sector Context:**There is a major next-level breakthrough that OpenAI is expected to release today that has agents performing on the same level as PHDs, Altman is meeting today with US government officials. META is the creator of Llama, which is another open source model compared to OpenAI's closed models.

**Risks:** Deepseek has been the main threat involved, with competitors from China using distillation and other AI techniques to be able to train a far cheaper model that brings up the question of why our large tech firms are spending so much on GPUs. (I'm sure this is news to you /s)

**Related Tickers:** FAANG stocks, SNAP, PINS, etc.

Offhand:  Something worth remembering is that there is a $10B undersea cable that spans over 40K km that they plan to build (unknown what the cable is for), more details coming in 2025. Likely some kind of fiber optic cable.

**Ticker:** [**TSLA (Tesla Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Reported earnings of $0.73 vs $0.76 expected. Revenue of $25.71B vs $27.23B expected. Most of this revenue miss came from miss in sale of EVs. 

TSLA announced interesting plans to lower the price of EVs in 2025 but also didn't give specific details regarding the production volume targets (as they have in the past), and also announced that there would be a paid robotaxi service in Austin in June. This puts them in competition with Waymo/UBER. Personally I think the vision-only approach is not viable in the long-run but hey, I'm no self-driving PHD. 

CAPEX was ALSO higher as with META due to spending increases from AI training infra costs and battery production capacity.

**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** I'm mainly interested in the $375/$400 level, not too interested in going long despite the multi-day slide in price.

**Context:** Main reason for TSLA's selloff was the lack of full-year guidance (it gives the subtext that it's too bad to release publically or it's up in the air). Political statements made by Musk may contribute to future issues for TSLA.

**Sector Context:** Revenue shortfall was caused due to lower-than-expected vehicle deliveries/ increased sale incentives, 496K cars vs 507K exp. China's BYD is rapidly catching up, and the (possible) removal of the US EV tax credit may make EV's more expensive

**Risks:** Mainly geopolitical- if the tariffs on EV vehicles imported to the US gets removed, TSLA will face fiercer competition from BYD. Also Elon Musk.

**Related Tickers:** BYD (but mainly trades in China, TSLA isn't as impacted by AI news.)



[**NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation) (in addition to ARM/AMD/SMH/SOXL/semiconductor stocks)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** The reveal of Deepseek has introduced an AI model that rivals existing solutions but was developed at around $6M. However there's a rumor that Deepseek is actually trained on 50K H100 NVDA gpus.

**Yesterday after the close, there was an announcement Trump officials discussing tightening curbs on Nvidia's China sales.**

**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** Overall, there's been a massive selloff since NVDA was $150 at the end of last week. Overall interested again if we hit $116, but low confidence we'll sell off again. 

Currently long.

**Sector Context:** Not much to really say about this beyond NVDA having the most advanced chips that are widespread for training because of the CUDA architecture- most people are doubtful that the TOTAL cost was $6M

US Officials are examining export restrictions but China will likely find a way to bypass them as they have previously.

**Risks:** Mainly geopolitical, again. Obviously it's very difficult to restrict trade to a country that we have no military presence in or surround, and China is economically far more powerful than those we have attempted trade restrictions on in the past.

TSLA is also possibly affected because SpaceX trades as a proxy to TSLA news. VZ/T/other phone providers may be affected but the use case is so niche that I won't hold my breath. 

>Apple Inc. has been secretly working with SpaceX and T-Mobile US Inc. to add support for the Starlink network in its latest iPhone software, providing an alternative to the company’s in-house satellite-communication service.

>

>The companies have been testing iPhones with the Starlink service from Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp., according to people with knowledge of the matter. In an under-the-radar move, the smartphone’s latest software update — released Monday — now supports the technology.

>

>The tie-up comes as a surprise: T-Mobile has previously only specified Starlink as an option for Samsung Electronics Co. phones, such as the Z Fold and S24 models. Apple, meanwhile, already provides a Globalstar Inc. offering that lets consumers send texts and contact emergency responders when out of cellular range.

>

>T-Mobile has begun allowing customers to sign up for an early version of the Starlink service, and this week the carrier enabled a small number of iPhones as part of a beta test.

>

>The first users received text messages from T-Mobile saying, “You’re in the T-Mobile Starlink beta. You can now stay connected with texting via satellite from virtually anywhere. To start experiencing coverage beyond, please update to iOS 18.3.” Users in the program have a new toggle switch in their iPhone cellular data settings to manage the satellite feature.

>

>An Apple spokesperson declined to comment, while T-Mobile said that the test will “begin with select optimized smartphones” and that the full launch will “support the vast majority of modern smartphones.” T-Mobile has also opened the beta to some users running Android 15, the latest version of the Google operating system. A representative for SpaceX didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

>

>Ever since Apple teamed up with Globalstar to offer satellite features in 2022, there’s been speculation over whether it might support competing networks. The day after Apple’s 2022 announcement, Musk posted on X that his company has “had some promising conversations with Apple about Starlink connectivity.”

>

>Here’s how it will work: When a T-Mobile iPhone is in an area without cellular connectivity, devices that are part of the Starlink program will first try to pair with SpaceX satellites. Users will also be able to enable texting via the satellite menu for the Globalstar service or contact emergency services through Apple.

>

>The initial version of Starlink is exclusively for texting. But SpaceX and T-Mobile have said that they plan to expand into data connections and voice calls in the future. The program also is only available in the US for now. That contrasts with Apple’s Globalstar service, which works in several countries. SpaceX is looking to expand Starlink to other carriers globally.

>

>There’s another major difference between the two services. The current Apple feature requires users to point their iPhone to the sky to find a satellite. The Starlink option, meanwhile, is designed to work automatically — even when the phone is in a customer’s pocket.

>

>Both the Starlink and Apple satellite features are designed to work in off-the-grid areas, such as hiking trails, that don’t have cellular service. The capabilities can’t be used in places where a mobile-phone network is within reach. Support for the Apple feature is available on most current iPhone models and the company plans to bring it to its Ultra smartwatch later this year, Bloomberg News has reported.

>

>T-Mobile updated its website this week to tell beta testers that the iPhone is supported as part of the iOS 18.3 software release. As of now, the number of users in the beta is minimal, with T-Mobile planning to expand the program in February. Apple’s announcement of iOS 18.3 touted AI features and bug fixes, but it didn’t disclose the Starlink support.

>

>SpaceX requested authority to begin beta-testing the service starting Monday. The Federal Communications Commission granted SpaceX conditional approval for its satellites to supplement T-Mobile’s cellular network in November.

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/bridgewater-sees-shortterm-correction-for-tech-stocks-but-bullish-on-deepseek-impact-3834767



  Hedge fund manager Bridgewater Associates said Chinese startup DeepSeek's launch of its latest artificial intelligence (AI) models could lead to a short-term correction in many tech companies' share prices but is positive for the industry.

The comments come amid a tech stocks sell-off prompted by the release of a free AI assistant launched by DeepSeek last week that the startup said uses less data at a fraction of the cost of services currently available.

DeepSeek's AI Assistant has overtaken rival ChatGPT to become the top-rated free application available on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s App Store in the United States, raising doubts about the reasoning behind some U.S. tech companies' decision to pledge billions of dollars in AI investment.

""DeepSeek’s progress is big news, but not bad news for most of the AI ecosystem,"" Bridgewater said in a note on Monday authored by Co-Chief Investment Officer Greg Jensen and Jas Sekhon, chief scientist of AIA Labs, a division within the hedge fund focused on developing and utilizing AI and machine learning technologies to generate investment strategies and insights.

DeepSeek threatens share prices for many tech stocks in the short term, Bridgewater said.

""This may be especially true for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), because DeepSeek’s success may encourage companies to invest more in achieving efficiency gains by optimizing how AI software interacts with the hardware,"" said the note.

Shares in Nvidia, a leader in the AI chip market, fell 17% on Monday, wiping $593 billion from its market value - a record one-day loss for any company - and dragged U.S. stocks lower. That drop was partly corrected on Tuesday, with Nvidia shares up around 5% in premarket trading.

2025-01-26 19:47:36,Apple,AAPL,S&P500 vs individual stocks,"Hi all,
Apologies for the maybe stupid question.

I have started investing about 1 year ago almost all of it (if not all) into well diversified ETFs like SXR8 and SPYY (yes, I know they overlap but I wanted to make it a little bit more USA heavy).

Now, I have really been wanting to invest into stocks and, of course, do the due diligence of learning about it. As I am still on the basics I can't help myself but ask, even long term, is SPY a better bet than, let's say, AAPL?
I understand that sometimes picking the ""good"" stock is difficult, but even 10 years ago Apple was among the companies with the highest market cap and still managed to outperform the index.

So I have 2 stupid questions based on this:
1. In your opinion, might this continue to happen in the future? Not necessarily apple but alphabet, Microsoft, nvidia or Meta are safer bets than Spy?
2. What are your recommendations on where to learn about investing into individual stocks, not say trading but more middle term (I believe it's called swing trading?)

Thanks in advance!",28,41,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iaoa6o/sp500_vs_individual_stocks/

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2025-01-24 04:10:35,Apple,AAPL,Switched from Ameriprise managed account to Fidelity - Sell individual stocks?,"After a year of trying an Ameriprise managed account, I recently moved everything to Fidelity to start managing it myself. They underperformed the S&P500 (before their fee), and almost all positions are just S&P500 companies anyways, so I figured if I went 100% into an S&P index on my own I can't do worse.

I'm not sure how best to proceed with the current number of individual stocks. There are 64 positions total and it's unrealistic that I'll be able to keep track of the performance/trajectory of that many companies. Buffet's ""pick a few winners"" comes to mind. I've been assuming the best thing to do is to slowly liquidate the one's I don't have a specific interest in, and buy VOO/SPY in their place.

There are many companies that I like and would like to hold on to (AAPL, AMD, AMZN, BRKB, GOOGL, JNJ, KO, MSFT, NVDA, NFLX, PG). However, the majority are S&P 500 companies that I don't follow closely (ABT, ADBE, AMAT, AMGN, AMT, AVGO, AZN, BA, BMY, CAT, COP, CRM, CVX, ... to name a few). It's not that I don't know those companies, but it feels ignorant to hold onto them knowing that I won't have time to monitor their performance.

Is there a best way to go about liquidating those and moving into an S&P 500 index? Initial temptation is gambler's fallacy (sell the low performers first and keep the better ones a bit longer).",4,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1i8mzb1/switched_from_ameriprise_managed_account_to/

Anyone who was around at the time can testify that this really did represent consensus opinions in this sub at that time, which you can see in the comments of that post.  Note that the game store madness did not really begin until a couple weeks later, which is why it did not appear there.

I felt like it was going to play out poorly so I bookmarked it, and now have been doing yearly updates.  After all, for something like this, you really need to give it a multiple year timeline at least.

We are now on year 4, and to date I have sarcastically remarked about how the sharp, financial geniuses of the time performed against SPY and VTI.  This year I was rather surprised at the results.  All 2025 numbers use the prices right now.

*I used a $100,000 initial investment and just rounded all the prices to the dollar for visual simplicity (all entries use the real, full prices, I have just rounded them for this table).  This also backtracks prices from stock splits.*

Oh.   Though I must admit that I was caught off guard by the comeback it is mounting.  Reddit ETF went up 69% in 2024 and is closing in on VTI.

 BUT what i am asking is if NVDA/TSLA/LLY/Planatir/etc. have big earnings,miss, can the stock price shake it off and continue an incredible bullish run.. Or is,that generally the end of the extraordinary stock run?

In recnt times, it seems like the 4 stocks i mentioned had really amazing runs (very little precedence i'd say,for,such huge runs over,a medium length period, and eapecially for mega-caps)..  w​as there very little bad news,associated with them? Or,did investors create their bubble-like returns to some degree absent specific good news much of the time (i mean absence,of bi-weekly specific good news)

Something I've wondered for awhile.. Surprisingly i have not seen a research paper on this subject?

Right i am wondering this,about Tesla in particular.. NVDA and LLY have slowed alot.. And Planitir not a key stock

I do know AAPL didn't have a meaningful earnings miss for a long time.. 10 years or so

Thanks in adance.. I am very interested in stock theory, backteating and research papers (academic or practitioner)

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

I kinda got this idea in my head that AAPL is a company without much growth left and have been thinking about lightening up my position on it.

So I decided to make some graphs to figure out what to think and because pictures easy raw data hard. 

First off I was curious what apple's shares outstanding looked like. I know their buy back program is massive and I also know they're not growing top line revenue but are spending a ton on buybacks so this was a good place to start. Considering the share price has also been going up a lot and their market cap is massive so I thought buybacks might have a negligible effect. Wow was I wrong. The shares outstanding are down like 36% in ten years! I couldn't ask for a better looking chart. At this rate it'll all be bought back in like 18.9 more years.

Then I was obviously curious about the EPS and decided to graph that. I was less surprised about how this turned out but it did still offer some insights. I hadn't seen before that they had multiple recent periods of EPS decline that they managed to turn around in big ways. And their EPS since covid is surprisingly down less than I thought so that's not so bad.

It doesn't change my opinion that their product lines are basically stagnant and not exactly innovative on a level that would spur a ton of growth, who tf needs another slimmer iPhone, iPad etc and I think that's a pretty widely held belief given the charts.

However, it's pretty crazy to see that they've bought back a 3rd of their shares in the past 9 years. Also pretty wild to see how its EPS has grown despite not a lot of innovation.

Lastly I was curious how their wearables revenue was doing because I heard recently about the FDA approving AirPods to be hearing devices which is probably a huge market? IDK but what I do know is hearing aids are stupid expensive compared to $200 air pods so this could be big. So far it looks like wearables is doing about $9B a quarter so if growth in that picked up it could be meaningful

All in all I think I keep my position the same, especially considering most of it is through SPYG which has AAPL and NVDA nearly the same weights which kinda strikes me as a yin and yang sorta situation.

And you are doing, say $200 per month or perhaps $500 every quarter (more or less, depending on your financial situations) per stock.

1) At what stage of the stock's life would you then decide to stop DCA? Especially for stocks like MSFT and AAPL that have been around for a long while?

2) Also, while you DCA, would you also sell your initial amount you bought? Or you'd let it ride?

2024-12-05 09:57:01,Apple,AAPL,TSMC in talks with Nvidia for AI chip production in Arizona,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co is in discussions with Nvidia Corp to produce its Blackwell artificial intelligence chips at the contract manufacturer's new plant in Arizona, three sources familiar with the matter said.

TSMC is already making preparations to start production early next year, the sources said.

Nvidia's Blackwell chips, which the company unveiled in March, have so far been manufactured at TSMC's facilities in Taiwan. The company has seen high demand from customers involved in generative AI and accelerated computing for the chips, which it says is 30 times speedier at tasks like serving up answers from chatbots.

The agreement, if finalised, would secure another customer for TSMC's Arizona facility, which is scheduled to start volume production next year.

TSMC and Nvidia declined to comment. The sources did not want to be identified as the talks were confidential.

Two of the sources said Apple (AAPL) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are current customers at the Arizona plant. Apple and AMD did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

However, while TSMC plans to produce the front-end process of Nvidia's Blackwell chips in Arizona, the chips will still need to be shipped back to Taiwan for packaging. The Arizona facility does not have chip on wafer on substrate (CoWoS) capacity that is essential to the Blackwell chips, two of the sources said.

All of TSMC's CoWoS capacity is currently in Taiwan.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2024-11-02 18:20:38,Apple,AAPL,Globalstar and Apple expanded partnership ,"Does anyone have anymore information on Globalstar GSAT and Apple AAPL expanded partnership? Is GSAT a buy after the 40% rise in share price?.

Here is some information I have , but is there anything I should be aware of ? 

The expanded partnership between Globalstar (GSAT) and Apple (APL) could bring significant long-  term benefits to Globalstar's stock, though some challenges may stil lie ahead.  
Potential Positive Impacts  I. Revenue Growth: With Apple prepaying up to $1.1 billion and committing to pay additional  service fees, Globalstar can expect substantial revenue growth. The agreement is projected to  more than double Globalstar's annual revenue compared to 2024 levels, primarily driven by the  new satellite network's capacity and performance milestones  2. Market Confidence: Apple's involvement and the substantial upfront payments provide market  validation for Globalstar, boosting investor confidence. A stronger association with Apple, along  with its 20% equity stake in Globalstar's satellite network, reinforces the viability and demand for  satellite-enabled connectivity, especially in remote and underserved areas
3. Future Expansion Opportunities: The network's design and expanded ground infrastructure  allow Globalstar to potentially explore new revenue streams, including other high-reliability  C  industries (e.g., maritime or government sectors), beyond its arrangement with Apple cOwews  
Potential Risks  
1. High Dependency on Apple: The partners. p heavily ties Globalstar's growth trajectory to zero.
3. Future Expansion Opportunities: The network's design and expanded ground infrastructure  allow Globalstar to potentially explore new revenue streams, including other high-reliability  industries (e.g. maritime or government sectors), beyond its arrangement with Apple.
Potential Risks  
1. High Dependency on Apple: The partnership heavily ties Globalstar's growth trajectory to  Apple's needs and future directions. If Apple shifts its strategic focus away from satellite  communication, Globalstar's revenue and stock could be negatively affected,  
2. Execution Risks: Globalstar must deliver the new MSS network according to Apple's  performance milestones. Failing to meet these milestones could result in reduced or delayed  payments, which would likely impact the stock negatively.
In the near term, Globalstar's stock may experience heightened volatility, as its year-to-date  performance has already been variable. However, if Globalstar manages this partnership successfully.  it could see sustained growth, especially as satelite connectivity becomes increasingly relevant to  tech giants like Apple.

Earnings really grew 8.5% in Q3 to $11.2 billion against $10.3 billion and were up 18.0% for the nine months to $33.0 billion from $28.0 billion. Just as short-term movements in equity prices can distort the reporting of operating profits, so to do currency swings on debt outstanding. Both should be excluded from an analysis of operating and economic profit.**

2024-10-28 17:03:24,Apple,AAPL,Bloomberg’s estimates on the big four tech giants ,"The big four tech giants are expected to spend a record $56 billion in total capital expenditures in the third quarter, according to the average estimate of analysts aggregated by Bloomberg. Much of that spending will go to NVIDIA and other AI-related device makers, with further increases expected in the coming quarters.
All signs point to continued strong AI-related spending. From chip device maker Asmax (ASML.US) to TSMC (TSM.US), AI has been a big part of this earnings season.
That backdrop has pushed NVIDIA shares higher, while Chief Executive Jen-Hsun Huang has assured that production of its new Blackwell chips is going well and demand is strong. NVIDIA is the biggest beneficiary of the big investment in artificial intelligence computing devices. The stock hit an all-time high last week and now has a market capitalization of about $3.5 trillion, slightly less than Apple (AAPL.US), which is still the world's most valuable company.
To be sure, there are concerns about the big tech companies' spending on artificial intelligence, as investors believe the billions of dollars these companies are investing are generating relatively little revenue. As such, this will be another focus of attention this week when these companies report earnings.
You have to walk the fine line of investing,“ said Paul Marino, chief revenue officer at Themes ETFs, ‘so that investors understand that you're ’not going too far”.
Nvidia's revenue is expected to more than double this year to $125.6 billion, according to the average forecast of analysts compiled by Bloomberg. Next year, the chipmaker's fiscal year 2026, sales are expected to grow 44 percent to $181 billion.
Of course, there are other companies benefiting from high AI spending, including Broadcom, Ultra Micro Computer and Dell Technologies.",37,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ge79db/bloombergs_estimates_on_the_big_four_tech_giants/

AAPL -- I continue to see them innovate, they won't stick with something that isn't working, and their stuff just works.

2024-10-18 14:59:12,Apple,AAPL,I Flipped My Entire Portfolio of ETFs for AI Stocks,"Yesterday, I made a major shift in my stock portfolio. I used to rely on ETFs like SPY, QQQ, and SCHD, but now I’ve sold most of them and focused on NVDA, MSFT, GOOGL, ISRG, AAPL, SCHG, and a bit of SOXX.

 - NVDA $237K

 - SCHG $121K

 - MSFT $105K

 - GOOGL $78K

 - AAPL $74K

 - ISRG $64K

 - SOXX $61K

 - BRK-B $47K

Here’s why: Right now, AI might feel limited to things like ChatGPT, but its potential goes far beyond that. Over the next 3, 5, or 10 years, AI is going to transform industries in ways we can’t fully imagine yet. We’re talking about healthcare revolutionizing how we diagnose and treat patients, transportation with autonomous vehicles and drones making logistics smarter and more efficient, and manufacturing, where AI will optimize production processes and supply chains.

Now, I know what you're thinking: 'What, you think the world is full of cave dwellers? Who doesn't know that?' and you're right. Everyone knows AI techonology will be advanced and utilized in so many ways in the near future.

But look, you can think of it like real estate. Sure, property values rise while new highways or shopping centers are being built, but the real surge in value happens once people start using them and see the full benefits. Right now, AI is still in its “under construction” phase—people can imagine the future potential, but the true value hasn’t been fully realized yet. The market has priced in expectations, sure, but once AI is fully integrated across industries and we start seeing its widespread, real-world impact, I believe we’ll see another major surge in stock prices. What’s priced in now is just the beginning—the real growth will come as AI starts transforming daily life and business on a much larger scale.

Before ChatGPT went mainstream, people assumed ‘just’ that level of AI technology would arrive soon enough, but they didn’t think it would have this much of an impact on stock prices once it came to life for the public. Everyone knew advanced AI was on the horizon, but the market didn’t price it like they do now. This shows just how much underestimation happens until we truly start experiencing the technology firsthand. And that’s why, despite what’s already been priced in, I think AI stocks are still undervalued given the game-changing growth ahead. Anyone else rethinking their portfolio with AI at the center?",0,64,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g6k31k/i_flipped_my_entire_portfolio_of_etfs_for_ai/

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2024-10-09 09:32:24,Apple,AAPL,TSMC's revenue for September surged 39.6% YoY,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) revenue for September surged 39.6% year-over-year to about NT$251.87B amid growing demand for artificial intelligence chips for use in AI products.

TSM — which produces chips for some of the world's largest tech companies including Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) — saw September-quarter revenue of NT$759.69B (adding revenues for July NT$256.95B, August NT$250.87B and September NT$251.87B) (about $23.6B).

The average analyst forecast is NT$748B, according to a report by Bloomberg News.

While announcing its second quarter results in July, TSM said it expected third quarter revenue to be between $22.4B and $23.2B (midpoint of $22.8B). For the third quarter, the company expected its business to be helped by strong smartphone and AI-related demand for its leading-edge process technologies.

Month-over-month TSM's revenue rose 0.4% as it had generated NT$250.87B in revenue in August.

TSM is slated to report its third quarter results on Oct. 17.",95,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1fznfk0/tsmcs_revenue_for_september_surged_396_yoy/

2024-10-01 19:15:40,Apple,AAPL,Challenge to find stocks matching 13 attributes of Peter Lynch,"I tried to find modern examples to each attribute mentioned in Chapter 8 of One Up on Wall Street. Then I thought this community could find better fits and have fun together. So please share you candidates for any category below - maybe we discover hidden gems along the way.

RECAP: Chapter 8 of One Up on Wall Street is  filled with fundamental yet profound strategies.  Invest in simple, easy-to-understand businesses over complex ones.  Identify undervalued companies with stable returns and less competition. And, search for as many of 13 attributes of the hypothetically ""perfect company."" The dream attributes of such a company go as:

***It Sounds Dull—Or Even Better Ridiculous:***

Companies with unexciting or absurd names often go unnoticed and can be undervalued, providing excellent buying opportunities. Lynch highlights that these companies are typically engaged in simple, straightforward businesses and the duller the name, the better the prospects could be.

My examples: Duckhorn Portfolio (NAPA) & The Lovesac Company (LOVE)

***It Does Something Dull:***

Companies engaged in mundane or straightforward businesses might not attract attention but often provide stable and increasing returns. Lynch appreciates companies that do boring things as they are less likely to be in the limelight and more likely to be undervalued.

My examples: Waste Management (WM) & Stepan Company (SCL)

***It Does Something Disagreeable:***

Businesses involved in unpleasant industries (like waste management) are often overlooked. Their disagreeable nature keeps them under the radar of most investors, potentially leading to lower valuations and higher returns for those willing to invest in them.

My Examples: Altria Group (MO), cannabis companies and Caesars Entertainment (CZR)

***It’s a Spinoff:***

Corporate spinoffs often result in profitable investment opportunities. Parent companies usually ensure that spinoffs have strong balance sheets and are well-positioned for success, leading to lucrative investments.

Found a good website on this: [https://thezenofinvesting.com/recent-spinoffs/](https://thezenofinvesting.com/recent-spinoffs/)

***The Institutions Don’t Own It, and The Analysts Don’t Follow It:***

Stocks with little to no institutional ownership and minimal analyst coverage can indicate untapped potential. These ""ignored"" stocks might offer significant opportunities for gains before they become mainstream.

My examples: Denny's Corporation (DENN) & Turtle Beach Corporation (HEAR)

***The Rumors Abound: It’s Involved with Toxic Waste and/or the Mafia:***

Lynch points out that companies involved in industries surrounded by rumors or negative perceptions, like waste management or alleged Mafia connections, can offer hidden value. The negative stigma leads to fewer investors and potentially lower valuations.

My examples: **Clean Harbors (CLH)** & Boyd Gaming (BYD)

***There’s Something Depressing About It:***

Companies operating in industries that deal with the less pleasant aspects of life, like funeral services, often have consistent demand and face little competition. They are typically ignored by the larger investing community, providing opportunities for higher returns.

My examples: Service Corporation International (SCI) & Matthews International Corporation (MATW)

***It’s a No-Growth Industry:***

Contrary to popular belief, Lynch prefers investing in low or no-growth industries as they tend to have less competition and more predictable business. The stability and predictability of such industries can lead to steady returns.

My examples: Consolidated Edison (ED) & American Water Works (AWK)

***It’s Got a Niche:***

A strong niche market provides a company with a competitive edge and often a virtual monopoly in its area. Niche companies can control pricing and enjoy high barriers to entry for competitors, often leading to sustained profits

My examples: Idexx Laboratories (IDXX) & WD-40 Company (WDFC)

***People Have to Keep Buying It:***

Lynch prefers investing in companies that make essential, habitual or addictive products like drugs, soft drinks, or cigarettes over those making fickle products, as continuous buying ensures steady business.

My examples: Procter & Gamble (PG) & Reckitt Benckiser (RBGLY)

***It's a User of Technology:***

Companies that effectively utilize technology to reduce costs or enhance services are appealing. For example, a company benefiting from the technological price war, like Automatic Data Processing using cheaper computers to increase its profitability, is a better bet than the companies making the computers.

***The Insiders are Buyers:***

Insider buying is a strong positive signal. If the people who know the company best are buying its stock, it's a good indication of confidence in the company's future. Lynch values insider buying as a sign that the company won't go bankrupt soon and that management is aligned with shareholders' interests.

My examples: Zoom Video Communications (ZM) & Carnival Corporation (CCL)

***The Company is Buying Back Shares:***

Companies that buy back their own shares reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases the value of the remaining shares. This action typically indicates the company believes its shares are undervalued and is a way to reward investors. Lynch sees share buybacks as a very positive move, often more beneficial than other use of capital like dividends or acquisitions​.

2024-10-01 15:23:05,Apple,AAPL,The Crash of the stock market has arrived. Price/Earnings ratio just broke 30 for the entire S&P 500. ,"Almost 90 days ago I made a post in an alternate subreddit regarding why I believe the stock market will begin to crash within 120 days -- Essentially the crash will begin by the day before the election. I have included that entire post below -- and all of these reasons still remain relevant... Moreso than ever with the news from the Middle East today. Obviously the port strike is expediting things today. Nonetheless -- I think the post is super relevant, and for some reason, the moderators of WSB deleted the post after 6 hours, despite it receiving over 2.2 million views, and over 1100 shares. 

The ride the market has been on, quite simply, has been insane.

According to generally accepted wisdom -- by investing in the S&P 500, you can anticipate to double your money, on average, every 6.5 years. I'm not 100% certain as to why that's the accepted figure -- as calculating the last 14 6.5 year periods the average rate of return has been 64%.

Below is a chart of the average price/rate of return of GSPC (The S&P) over the last 14 cycles.. I couldn't easily find data prior to this..

|Year|GSPC Price|6.5 year return on investment|
|:-|:-|:-|
||
|1933.5|10.91||
|1940|12.05|10.44%|
|1946.5|18.43|52.95%|
|1953|26.38|43.13%|
|1959.5|58.68|122%|
|1966|92.88|58%|
|1972.5|107.14|15%|
|1979|99.93|-7.22%|
|1985.5|191.85|91.90%|
|1992|408.78|113%|
|1998.5|1133.84|177%|
|2005|1181.27|4.10%|
|2011.5|1320.64|11.70%|
|2018|2471.65|87.10%|
|2024.5|5525.29|123%|

While the last two cycles don't necessarily ring any alarm bells -- we have just more than doubled, twice, looking at the last two cycles -- There is one massive, bloated, shit filled elephant in the room... Price to Earnings Ratio.

Historically, the Price to Earnings ratio for the S&P has sat just under 20 (the easiest data I could find puts it at 19.4x between 1974 and 2017 -- I'm not grabbing any arbitrary dates or numbers here). The Median value has it under 18x, and there have even been extended periods of time where it traded at +/- 10x.

Currently -- the P/E ratio sits at 28.71 -- roughly 150% of what is normal.

In the history of the S&P, the P/E ratio has hit this level only 3 times...

* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Dot Com Bubble (P/E broke 30 +/- April 2001).
* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Global Financial Crisis (P/E broke 30 +/- October 2008).
* The quarter after Covid hit. (P/E broke 30 +/- March 2020).

Images aren't allowed in this subreddit -- but if you go to the multpl website you will see we finished trading yesterday, 09/30, at a P/E of 30.07

Historically -- what has happened to the markets after crossing this mark? In all three scenarios, by the time we crossed a P/E of 30, the dam had already started to break.

* During the Dot Com bubble, the S&P 500 was already down 19% from its highs, and would fall another 34% before finally starting to recover. By the the time the bleeding stopped, it had lost 47% of its value.
* During the global financial crisis, an almost identical story can be told. The S&P had lost 18% of its value by time P/E broke 30, and when it finally bottomed out in February of 2009, it lost 53% of its total value.
* Covid, obviously, was a much quicker recovery... as we only fell 32%, and had bounced back in less than 6 months time (reason for which outlined later).

**Okay -- so** ***Maybe*** **we have a price to earnings ratio problem, but you're still not sold. What else do we have going on?**

Outside of the fact that I firmly believe that the market is overvalued today, I think there are several other major issues that we are facing in the current environment -- and while I could write a diatribe for each, for purposes of succinctness, I'll simply outline them via bullet points below.

* Credit card debt is at an all time high, and outside of a brief period after Covid checks arrived, has been rising since 2013.
* Younger Americans are in the most trouble with credit card debt. As boomers continue to retire, it will be the working class most disproportionately affected.
* Credit card delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2011.
* Auto loans debt and average auto loan payments are the highest they've been at any point in history. Auto loan delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2010.
* The stock market is insanely top heavy right now. The Magnificent 7 (Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA)) now account for 45% of the entire value of the Nasdaq. They account for roughly 30% of the entire stock market combined. As of today -- they are trading at a combined P/E of 42x. A correction in these 7 companies would be absolutely catastrophic for the entire market as a whole.
* We are starting to see a weakening of the labor market. Furthermore -- I do not believe the jobs numbers are entirely as they seem. I think many of the jobs 'added' over the last 18 months have been individuals picking up second jobs to help make ends meet. Any reasonable increase in the unemployment rate have absolutely massive consequences.
* Many banks are holding on to massive unrealized losses. While this has the potential to hit the regional banks the worst, some of the largest banks -- including Bank of America, Charles Schwab, and USAA have unbooked security losses that are greater than 50% of their equity capital.
* Regional banks are at risk due to the massive amounts of US treasury notes they hold that were bought during Covid. In short -- nobody was borrowing money to buy homes or cars. Banks, flush with cash, took said money and bought US T notes with this money so they could earn some interest on it. This was at a time when interest rates were very low. Now that interest rates are high -- demand for these old t notes is essentially non existent, as you buy new t notes that pay a much higher rate of return. If any sort of bank run starts, these banks will be forced to liquidate said t-bills, and they will have to sell them at a loss. If too many people do this simultaneously, the bank will become insolvent -- like what we saw happen with Silicon Valley bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank. (Side note -- the failure of these three banks alone was larger than the combined total of bank failures in 2008 during the global financial crisis).
* The US government still has a spending problem. Our deficit has grown by $500 million since I started writing this an hour ago.
* Global tensions are high -- and rising. Massive protests are erupting all over Europe.
* The US is involved in two proxy wars that don't appear as if they will abate any time soon.
* The political division in the US is as dramatic as I've seen it at any point in my existence. Perhaps those older and wiser than me can chime in here -- but it seems most are resorting to tribal, identity politics split down party lines.
* Commercial real estate is starting to buckle. Covid brought about work from home, and with many offices retaining those practices, or allowing partial work from home, office space supply far outpaces demand. This problem is exacerbated by high interest rates. Most commercial loans are done on 5 or 7 year balloon. When that balloon is bout to come due, the owner of that property will refinance the loan, restarting the 5 or 7 year period to avoid paying off the balance owed on the property. Many of these property owners that refinanced into low interest rates in 2020, during covid, when rates bottomed out -- are now having to get a new loan to keep from paying their balloon. However, with interest rates more than twice what they were several years ago, and vacancy rates skyrocketing, many of these real estate owners will not be able to pay the monthly mortgage on their buildings. Commercial Real Estate foreclosures jumped 117% in March alone.
* Housing has become increasingly less affordable for many Americans. For 2022 -- the most recent year I could find data -- a family earning the median US household income, renting a median priced US home, was spending 40% of their income on rent.
* Countries are abandoning the US dollar in droves.

I believe some of these issues, on their own, are enough to cause serious economic turmoil. Bundled together, I don't see how we aren't in for a very rude awakening.

**This economic downturn may be severe.**

In the three times this has happened before -- the action, or lake thereof varied dramatically. During scenario one -- the dot com bubble -- the government largely just let the companies fail. While I was only 11 at the time, my understanding is that there really were no bailouts here because the only people really hurt were the investors in those companies -- unlike scenario two. During the GFC, shuttering banks would have resulted in a complete collapse of the US (and really global) financial system. While I won't get into partisan politics, I'm of the belief that the covid bailouts were entirely unnecessary -- and more importantly for this post -- the reason that the upcoming crash is going to be so insanely problematic.

**Bailouts on any level, whether to companies, banks, or directly to citizens, will inevitably increase inflation. I don't think they are on the table for this correction.**

People have painted the inflation problem as a result of supply chain issues... And while supply chain issues didn't help, I think the bigger issue, by far, was the sheer amount of money we printed. You cannot make $4 trillion appear out of thin air and expect that every dollar in circulation isn't going to suddenly become worth less money. We just lived through this reality after the Covid printing.

This will largely tie the feds hands. Print more money -- we find ourselves in a cycle of ever increasing prices and higher interest rates.

**What happens from here?**

I don't know. Don't listen to me. I'm an idiot. Stock market will probably just continue to go up. I'm probably wrong about 100% of this.

The prediction in bold below is what I posted 90 days ago. I now believe the top is officially in -- that we won't see another ATH for a long time. 

**My Prediction? GSPC/SPY cruise up a tiny bit further, to +/- $5900/$590 -- before retreating to $3500/$350 by 12/2025.**

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

*****
> Stock futures were little changed Monday morning as investors await the Federal Reserve’s highly anticipated policy meeting, during which central bankers are expected to cut rates for the first time since 2020.
*****
> S&P 500 futures slipped less than 0.4%, while futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 104 points, or 0.2%. Meanwhile, Nasdaq-100 futures pulled back 0.3%.
*****
> Apple shares fell more than 2% in early trading after analysts at firms, including Bank of America and JPMorgan, noted that shipping times could point to lighter demand for iPhone 16 Pro models than the prior year.
*****
> The S&P 500 is less than 1% away from its July record and could notch a new all-time high this week. After a rough start to a historically weak September, the three major U.S. indexes ended last week’s trading session in the green, with the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite just closing their best week of 2024.
*****
> The Fed is set to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday and are widely anticipated to make their first interest rate cut since they began hiking rates in March 2022. A cut this week would be a pivotal move, as many investors hope the decision could lower borrowing costs for companies and improve overall earnings growth — boosting economic growth.
*****
> The overnight lending rate is currently at 5.25% to 5.5%. Traders are split on whether the central bank will cut rates by 25 or 50 basis points, per the CME Group’s FedWatch tool.
*****
> Stocks typically post strong gains during cycles where initial rate cuts are able to sustain economic expansion, BMO Capital chief investment strategist Brian Belski said.
*****
> “So long as nothing breaks in the economy, U.S. stocks remain firmly within a bull market, but with significantly strong trailing one-year performance headed into this initial rate cut, future gains are likely to be more muted relative to historical norms, in our view,” he said in a Friday note ahead.

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

*****

# [Stock futures are flat as September sluggishness continues, traders await inflation data: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/09/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures were mostly flat Tuesday after the major averages rebounded from their worst week in 2024.
*****
> Futures tied to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures each added about 0.1%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped 16 points, or less than 0.1%.
*****
> Cloud platform company Oracle surged about 8% after posting fiscal first-quarter results that topped expectations. Oracle also announced a partnership with Amazon Web Services to provide database services.
*****
> On Monday, the three major averages made a sharp comeback after posting their worst week this year as investors bought the dip. The S&P 500 popped 1.16% to snap a four-day run of losses and post its first winning day in September. The Nasdaq Composite also closed 1.16% higher, aided by a jump in Nvidia. The Dow climbed 484 points, or 1.2%.
*****
> These moves come as investors bet that a widely anticipated interest rate cut at the Federal Reserve’s Sept. 17-18 meeting could help assuage concerns over a weakening economy. August’s payrolls report, which came out last Friday, reflected growth of 142,000, below economists’ expectations. The results helped fuel a sell-off that day.
*****
> Traders have their eyes on two key economic reports that will likely be the next catalysts for stocks. The consumer price index report for August is due out Wednesday, followed by the producer price index on Thursday.
*****
> September is historically a weak month for equities. Investors remain cautious about seasonality’s effect on stock performance as well as uncertainty around the approaching U.S. presidential election on Nov. 5.
*****
> “We concur with the view that the market is likely to remain choppy at least until the election,” Bank of America equity and quantitative strategist Ohsung Kwon wrote Monday. “Macro data have been weakening, especially in manufacturing/goods, which represent 50% of earnings for the S&P 500.”

2024-09-08 21:02:32,Apple,AAPL,The AAPL Monday Morning arbitrage trade (codename 7senshino's arbitrage),"Update:  a user reminded me it's not an arbitrage, I agree with him. However I'm not able to update the post title, so I'm putting this update on the front here 

I'm sharing this old idea I had more than a decade ago. I bought AAPL around 2012. Then for several years, I would look daily at it's stock price. One day i noticed that if I bought AAPL at 9am ET on Monday morning then sell at 9.30am ET, I could possibly make a profit, at least on days where the market would not be doom and gloomy.
Doing it daily and compounding the profits, I'd end up possibly rich, at least based on a quick calculation I did in either 2014 or 2015  with a subset of data ranging forabout a quarter length...

That's it, easy right, little risk, hence a possible arbitrage:
Buy AAPL at 9 on Monday, sell it at 9.30.

But I never executed the idea as I didn't want to get into the active trading thing.
Fast forward now in 2024, I'm wondering if it  was a great idea?
I don't have access to my Bloomberg anymore and don't have time to run numbers. Maybe it's an old well known idea among traders and I'm not the first one who thought about it. 
Maybe it's still a valid trade, maybe there are other stocks who would enjoy the Monday morning effect or kick.
I have no idea.
But I wanted to share it here to all the experts to get some insights.
Feel free to use it if you can make a buck out of it. If you become rich and reach the moon, don't forget me :).
Cheers.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2024-09-04 13:00:41,Apple,AAPL,[Reuters Exclusive] Intel manufacturing business suffers setback as Broadcom tests disappoint,"Sept 4 (Reuters) - Intel's (INTC.O), contract manufacturing business has suffered a setback after tests with chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO.O), failed, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, dealing a blow to the company's turnaround efforts.

The tests conducted by Broadcom involved sending silicon wafers - the foot-wide discs on which chips are printed - through Intel's most advanced manufacturing process known as 18A, the sources said. Broadcom received the wafers back from Intel last month. After its engineers and executives studied the results, the company concluded the manufacturing process is not yet viable to move to high-volume production.

Reuters could not determine the current relationship between Broadcom and Intel or whether Broadcom had decided to walk away from a potential manufacturing deal.

""Intel 18A is powered on, healthy and yielding well, and we remain fully on track to begin high volume manufacturing next year,"" an Intel spokesperson said in a statement. ""There is a great deal of interest in Intel 18A across the industry but, as a matter of policy, we do not comment on specific customer conversations.""

A Broadcom spokesperson said the company is ""evaluating the product and service offerings of Intel Foundry and have not concluded that evaluation.""

Intel's contract manufacturing business was launched in 2021 as a key part of Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger's turnaround strategy.

Broadcom is not a household name but makes crucial networking gear and radio chips that helped generate $28 billion in overall chip sales in its last fiscal year. It has benefited from the boom in spending on artificial intelligence hardware, and J.P. Morgan analyst Harlan Sur estimated it will bank $11 billion to $12 billion from AI this year, up from $4 billion last year.

Some of its chip sales are from agreements with companies such as Alphabet's (GOOGL.O), Google and Meta Platforms (META.O), to help produce in-house AI processors, which can include arrangements with a manufacturer, such as Intel or Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW),.

**CRUCIAL SETBACK**

As part of a disastrous second-quarter earnings report that shaved more than a quarter from the company's market value, Intel announced a 15% job cut and a reduction in capital spending related to its factory construction. Gelsinger and other executives will present a plan to the board of directors in mid-September on possible cuts to business units and teams to reduce costs, Reuters reported on Sunday.

Intel has committed to about $100 billion of expansion and new factory construction at several sites in the U.S. A crucial part of the company's expansion includes attracting big customers such as Nvidia (NVDA.O), or Apple (AAPL.O), to fill up capacity at all its new sites.

Intel reported a $7 billion operating loss for the foundry business, wider than the $5.2 billion in losses the year earlier. Executives expect the contract chip business to achieve breakeven in 2027.

Typically fabricating an advanced chip requires more than 1,000 separate steps inside a chip factory, or fab, and takes roughly three months to complete. Production success is determined by the number of working chips on each silicon wafer. Achieving a substantial yield is crucial to move to producing the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of wafers demanded by big chip designers.

Broadcom's engineers had concerns with the viability of the process, the sources said. Typically that refers to the number of defects on each wafer or the quality of the chips fabricated.

For an advanced manufacturing process used by TSMC, the Taiwanese giant charges roughly $23,000 per wafer at high volume, according to two sources familiar with wafer pricing. Reuters could not determine Intel's wafer pricing.

TSMC declined to comment on its wafer pricing.

Moving a chip design from a manufacturing process used by a company such as TSMC to another vendor such as Samsung (005930.KS), or Intel can take months and requires dozens of engineers, depending on the complexity of the chip and the differences in manufacturing technology.

Betting on a new manufacturing process such as Intel's 18A is impossible for some smaller chip companies because doing so would require resources they do not have.

Intel released its manufacturing tool kit for its 18A process to other chipmakers over the summer, Gelsinger said on an earnings call last month.

The company plans to be ""manufacturing-ready"" by the end of this year for its own chips and begin high volume production for external customers in 2025, Gelsinger said. At an investor conference last week, he said there are a dozen customers ""actively engaged"" with the tool kit.

2024-08-21 00:34:56,Apple,AAPL,Big tech stock price vs market cap ,"So I was thinking about where big tech stock prices can go from here considering 7 stocks account for a significant portion of the US market already. It’s hard to comprehend a company that is already 7% of the total market, consistently beating the market over the long run. 

Then it hit me; With share buy backs, assuming these companies are buying back more shares than they’re paying out in comp every year (which it looks like they are), the stock prices of the major big tech companies should increase by a higher amount than their market caps do. 

A quick Google search reveals that AAPLs outstanding shares decreased 2.9% in 2022 and around similar amount in 2021. This basically a “guaranteed” 2% of annual growth on the existing shares not taking into account other factors that affect stock price?

Is there anywhere I can see a graph of a company’s market cap like you can do with stock price? I’d like to compare share price growth to market cap growth.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2024-08-14 12:14:48,Apple,AAPL,GOOG - Bull Case - Custom TPU leading to successful AI products,"I've been experimenting text based GPT from OpenAI's ChatGPT to Google Bard to now Gemini AI.

Since late '22 when the world was caught in attention on the magic of ChatGPT, people have been flocking to buy the next best accelerator cards (Nvidia), hoping they can be the next one to come out with the killer app - that ambitious goal to reach AGI first.

It's only up until very recently that I was made known that Gemini AI is entirely trained on Google custom TPU. I read a little about it (I found that TPU discussion is very little over here) and found that in the earlier days since Alexnet deep learning approach back to 2012.

Previous generalized computing (thank you Intel Xeon) tries to cope with big data workload. Accelerators were found to be particularly efficient in those machine learning workload. Early exploration by Google on designing custom TPU for themselves so they can have more flexibility catering to specific workloads. This decision alone turns out to be very valuable in today's Gen AI era.

With recent news from Apple that they have been training their AI models with Google's TPU, also the performance of Gemini AI to be on par with industry leading ChatGPT (heard that Antropic's Sonnet is even better - but Gemini is really good enough for my daily use).

These observations make strong statements to the Gen AI community, i.e.,  you can bypass Nvidia and still perform adequately well (even supercede for some reports) in your AI product offering.

The fact that Google does not hoard all its computing power to its own Gemini training, and the ability to extend its compute to customers like AAPL speak volume on the native TPU effectiveness.

Cost and time wise, Google is the prime candidate in AI era as TPU helps smoothen out the training cost. With ads revenue fueling the AI training (heard that OpenAI now needs more money), and superior TPU working natively, I'm of the opinion that Google will create a lot of value many years from now.",50,50,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1es01n4/goog_bull_case_custom_tpu_leading_to_successful/

2024-08-01 20:33:42,Apple,AAPL,"Apple sales rise 5%, topping estimates as iPad and Services revenue jump","Apple reported fiscal third-quarter earnings on Thursday that beat Wall Street expectations, with overall revenue rising 5%.  

Here’s how Apple did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ended June 29: 

EPS: $1.40 vs. $1.35 estimated
 
Revenue: $85.78 billion vs. $84.53 billion estimated 

iPhone revenue: $39.30 billion vs. $38.81 billion estimated 

Mac revenue: $7.01 billion vs. $7.02 billion estimated 

iPad revenue: $7.16 billion vs. $6.61 billion estimated 

Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue: $8.10 billion vs. $7.79 billion estimated 

Services revenue: $24.21 billion vs. $24.01 billion estimated 

Gross margin: 46.3% vs. 46.1% estimated 

Apple did not provide formal guidance, although CEO Tim Cook and CFO Luca Maestri often share information about the current quarter on a call with analysts.  

Apple reported $21.44 billion in net income during the quarter, versus $19.88 billion in the year-ago period.  

Apple’s most important business remains the iPhone, which accounted for about 46% of the company’s total sales during the quarter. While Apple beat LSEG estimates, the product line still declined about 1% on an annual basis to $39.29 billion in revenue.  

“On a constant currency basis, we grew year on year. And so that’s sort of how we look at it from an operational point of view,” Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC’s Steve Kovach.  

Cook said that while Apple doesn’t know about the positive sales impact from its newly announced Apple Intelligence service until it starts shipping to customers later this fall, he said that Apple had been increasing spending to get the service ready.  

“What we’ve done is we’ve redeployed a lot of people on to AI that were working on other things,” Cook said. “From a data center point of view, as you know, we have a hybrid approach. So we both have our own and we partner with people. And so that capex would be in the partners’ financials, and we would be paying expense.” 

“Certainly embedded in our results this quarter is an increase year over year in the amount we’re spending for AI and Apple intelligence,” Cook continued.  

Apple showed strongest growth in its iPad division, which grew nearly 24% year-over-year to $7.16 billion in sales. Apple released new iPads during the quarter for the first time since 2022, which spurred a wave of upgrades. 

Cook said that about half of iPad buyers haven’t owned one before, suggesting the tablet market is not yet saturated. 

Apple’s Mac division reported $7 billion in sales, up about 2% from the year-ago quarter.  

Apple Watch sales, headphones such as Beats or AirPods, and HomePod home speakers are reported under “Wearables, Home, and Accessories.” Sales in the catch-all category declined 2% to $8.10 billion during the quarter.  

“A whopping two thirds of the Apple Watch buyers were new to the product. So, we’re still growing that base significantly,” Cook said.  

The Services business is most important growth category for Apple and includes hardware warranties, revenue from Google, monthly cloud storage subscriptions, and the company’s content subscriptions, such as Apple TV+. The company reported $24.21 billion in Services sales, up 14% and in-line with Apple’s forecast and LSEG estimates. 

Apple said in a statement that it had more active devices in each of its regions than it ever had before, without providing a specific number. Apple’s active device count is important because it signifies a group of existing Apple customers to which it can sell its profitable services. Apple said in February that it had 2.2 billion active devices.  

Apple said it had 1 billion paid subscriptions, which includes subscriptions to iPhone apps through Apple’s App Store.  

However, Apple sales declined 6% to $14.72 billion in greater China, a region that also includes Taiwan and Hong Kong. Apple is under pressure in mainland China as local rivals such as Huawei introduce competing products.  

“Mainland China and Greater China actually had a record in the iPhone install base,” Cook said. “Kantar tells us we had the top three selling smartphones in urban China and the results in China represent an acceleration from the first half of the year.” 

Apple said it spent $32 billion on dividends and share repurchases during the quarter.

2024-08-01 18:13:46,Apple,AAPL,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

|+|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|Company|Current Price|Price Target|Percent to Target|Total Ratings|# Strong Buy Ratings|# Buy Ratings|% of Ratings that were Strong Buys|
|2|AAPL|222.08|209.76|105.87%|38|11|21|28.95%|

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2024-07-17 09:20:50,Apple,AAPL,Am I missing something?,"I was researching the difference between total outstanding shares vs float, and apparently most companies do not exclude instituional shares from float because they are traded on exchanges as well. My example is Apple, which despite having 57.59% institutionally owned shares its float is 15.31b of its 15.33b shares. What I don’t understand, however, is how it says 5.22% of shares are owned by insiders, which I thought was not included in public float calculation. However the float is 99.8%, not 94.78% or whatever; so clearly at least the vast majority of these shares are counted. Is it only certain restricted shares that are not counted? Also the only article I could really find on this on titan.com said some companies calculate institutional shares as part of public float, some don’t. Are there any examples of some that don’t? Thanks in advance.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2024-07-08 22:14:54,Apple,AAPL,"MSFT and AAPL are overvalued and overbought, Wallstreet is expecting too much from AI. ","I got to try Microsoft's copilot this week and i have to say i was underwhelmed by what it had to offer. It just felt like an enhancement for windows with more features, nothing ground breaking. This wasn't a major leap in technology like going from fax's to email. Tech companies releasing new (free)upgrades and new (free)products is like Nike releasing a new pair of shoes, just something else to add to the lineup. Will it make SOME peoples jobs more efficient, yes. Is it applicable for most people, i have to say no. Nike makes shoes for athletes but maybe 1-2% actually use them for what its intended for. Lets say a company has 20,000 employees, of those employees how many need it for their role or will using it on a daily basis? Maybe 90 % wont. If that's accurate a company will only pay for the 10% that need a user license.

If chat GPT was never released all the mag 7 earnings would still be about the same without it.

Now for the overvalued and overbought. MSFT has a PE of 40, one of the highest of all the mag 7. Your paying $40 for every dollar they earn. Based on their current AI stack im not sure they will be able to beat the current expectations in a big way consistently. MSFT is not NVDA. NVDA chips cost $30k+ each, as much as a low end Tesla. Copilot has a free version and the pro version is $20-$30 per user. Most people at companies are not using this and im not sure this will add to the bottom line very much. That means most of the earnings growth will have to come from the cloud business, admittedly the cloud business has been growing at double digits for a long time but there is also a lot of competition in cloud space, at some point growth will slow as cap ex spending slows. The other thing to consider is what AI costs for these companies. The GPU's are expensive, Data storage is expensive and the energy demand from AI use is very very expensive. At some point AI use, especially from free users is going to eat into the profit margins.

MSFT right now is like buying a over priced Cadillac, yeah it drives nice but its overpriced.

AAPL is also overvalued at 35x earnings. Adding chatGPT to a smartphone and enhancing siri isn't worth the current valuation. The goggles were a bust. No new products on the horizon just same stuff just newer versions. Apple isn't the glamorous high growth tech company it once was. Iphones sales are falling off in China and this will definitely show in the next couple quarters of earnings. Its the Nike of tech stocks. People aren't spending $100 for shoes they certainly wont spend $900+ for a phone. I wouldn't be surprised if Buffet starts to offload shares at this PE ratio.

That fourth industrial revolution is not happening today or tomorrow, we are too early. This is going to take some time.

I agree with Ken Griffin on this, the current AI products on the market are not the revolution many are hoping for, they're mediocre at best. There's too much spending and too much free products for this to add to any company's bottom line. The real winners are semi's, data storage and anything surrounding it.

2024-07-02 15:04:13,Apple,AAPL,"Only interrupt compounding, unless it's absolutely necessary.","So I hope you are all doing fine with your portfolios. I checked my YTD performance due to mid-year. I am up 21% (30th June) vs the S&P's about 14%. I just realized something I never really thought of before, because I was not a huge seller so far. My performance would have been much better without taking tax hits from selling stocks.

I am from Europe, tax hit is about 26% on all gains above 1000€(annually) when selling. I mean, I knew it before, but I just realized it this year, as my tax hits are 4 figures now. I do understand more and more why Warren B. says “If you aren't thinking about owning a stock for ten years, don't even think about owning it for ten minutes.” The most important part is really to not interrupt compounding.

Take for example AAPL. €10k invested in AAPL in January would be +17% €11.7k. You would have beaten the market when holding. If you sell: €1.7k gains 26% taxed left about €11.25k left. You would be up only up about 11% and been beaten by the index after selling. Index-funds have the big advantage, that they get taxed only at the very end, that way you don't interrupt compounding. I mean this is no rocket science and I am dumb to realize this only now, but the recent tax hits really opened my eyes.

To end this post with something useful: How is your portfolio doing? Have you beaten the S&P? What's your % YTD?

TLDR: Tax on my investments is destroys my gains. Never interrupt compounding, unless it's absolutely necessary.",68,56,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1dto192/only_interrupt_compounding_unless_its_absolutely/

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2024-06-17 17:15:52,Apple,AAPL,"Nvidia to get 20% weighting and billions in investor demand, while Apple demoted in major tech fund","KEY POINTS

* Microsoft and Nvidia will likely have a weight of around 21% in this tech ETF, while Apple will be down to about 4.5%, according to Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research.
* The rebalance will be in effect for one quarter, even if Apple outperforms Nvidia significantly ahead of the official date.
* The ETF has about $71 billion in assets under management, so a 15-percentage-point change in the fund equates to more than $10 billion.



[Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/)’s blistering rally will force a major technology exchange-traded fund to acquire more than $10 billion worth of shares of the chip giant while cutting dramatically back on [Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/).

The index that the [Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/XLK/) follows will soon rebalance, based on an adjusted market cap value from Friday’s close. The new calculations show [Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/) as the top stock in the index, followed by Nvidia and then Apple, according to Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research.

All three stocks would have a weight above 20% in the index if there were not caps in place. But diversification rules for the index limit how big the cumulative weight of stocks with at least a 5% share of the fund can be.

As a result, Microsoft and Nvidia will likely have a weight of around 21%, while Apple will fall sharply to about 4.5%, Bartolini said.

That is a change from the prior weightings, which saw Nvidia’s weight be kept artificially low by index rules. As of June 14, Microsoft and Apple were both at about 22% each in the fund, while Nvidia was just 6%.

  
The race to finish in the top two came down to the final day. As of Monday, market cap data from FactSet shows that all three companies are over $3.2 trillion and within $50 million of each other, though that data does differ slightly from the calculations used in the index.

The XLK has about $71 billion in assets under management, so a 15-percentage-point change in the fund equates to more than $10 billion. SPDR does not comment on specific trading strategies around rebalances.

The big shift in the XLK is an extreme example of how even passive index funds can diverge, especially when focusing on narrow slices of the market.

“Understanding how they might be weighted, where they’re allocated, what the rebalance frequency is, is really important because it can create differences in exposures and make what’s beneath the label seem different from fund to fund,” Bartolini said.

The fund follows the Technology Select Sector Index from S&P Dow Jones Indices, which uses a float-adjusted calculation to determine market cap. The rebalance officially takes effect at the end of this week.

The free-float adjustment for market cap accounts for large holders of an individual stock that are unlikely to be trading on a daily basis. For example, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway owns more than 5% of Apple, which could count against it in the index, Bartolini said.

“Its free-float market capitalization is reduced because you have so many controlled interests in the company,” Bartolini said.

The rebalance will be in effect for one quarter, even if Apple outperforms Nvidia significantly ahead of the official date.

On Monday, shares of Apple were up 1.8%, while Nvidia ticked up 0.2%.

2024-06-09 23:18:01,Apple,AAPL,Apple's (AAPL) Rollercoaster: Should You Jump In Now?,"If you’ve been keeping an eye on Apple (AAPL), you know it’s been a wild ride lately. The stock took a beating in the first four months of 2024, dropping 8% while the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index climbed 6%. Why? Stagnant growth and a DOJ lawsuit knocked investor confidence. But then May came along, and Apple bounced back with a 12% surge thanks to strong Q2 results for fiscal 2024, announced on May 2.

**Quick Stats**

* **Current Price:** $196.89 (+1.24%)
* **Market Cap:** $3,019B
* **52-Week Range:** $164.07 - $199.62
* **Volume:** 53M (Avg: 60M)

**What's Driving the Turnaround?**

Apple’s revenue for Q2 2024 dipped 4% year-over-year to $90.8 billion, mainly because iPhone sales fell to $46 billion from $51.3 billion last year. But here’s the kicker: Apple’s earnings per share nudged up to $1.53, beating the $1.50 expectation. The services sector is where Apple shone, raking in a record $23.9 billion, up 14% year-over-year. This area is a goldmine for Apple, bolstering its bottom line even when hardware sales lag.

Looking ahead, Apple expects revenue to pick up in the current quarter, driven by services and a bounce back in iPad sales. Given that iPhones contribute to half of Apple’s revenue, any uptick in smartphone sales will be a big win. The global smartphone market is on a comeback, with 7.8% growth in Q1 2024, according to IDC, and AI-enabled smartphones could be a game changer this year.

**AI: The Next Big Catalyst**

Apple’s rumored to be diving into the AI smartphone market with iOS 18. Features like AI-powered transcripts, message summaries, and even a smarter Siri could debut soon. AI enhancements are expected to drive another upgrade cycle, and with Apple holding a 17% share in the smartphone market, this could be huge.

**Should You Buy In?**

Analysts are bullish. Wedbush Securities sees Apple’s AI-enabled iPhones kicking off a major upgrade cycle, upping their price target to $275 from $250—a potential 45% gain from current levels. The median 12-month price target is $202, suggesting a 6% upside.

Here’s the play: Apple’s trading at 29 times trailing earnings, which is a discount compared to the Nasdaq-100’s 31 times. With analysts revising their earnings expectations upwards and AI developments on the horizon, this might be the moment to get in before Apple starts another run.

**Action Plan:**

1. **Buy Zone:** Under $195, if you’re looking for a solid entry.
2. **Sell Targets:** Short-term around $202; long-term riding the wave towards $275.
3. **Watch List:** Keep an eye on AI updates and quarterly earnings for quick reaction opportunities.

2024-06-06 18:04:53,Apple,AAPL,TSMC ponders boosting AI chip production prices for Nvidia: Morgan Stanley,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) is seriously considering increasing its production fees for artificial intelligence leader Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) , according to a report by Morgan Stanley.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang apparently agrees with the notion.



""TSMC's wafer price is indeed too low,"" said Huang at a Computex investor luncheon in Taipei on Wednesday.""I think TSMC's \[service\] price is too low,"" and that ""TSMC’s contribution to the world and the tech industry is under-presented by its financial results,"" he added.""NVIDIA is TSMC’s key customer and accounts for 10% of TSMC’s 2024 revenue, we estimate,"" said Morgan Stanley analyst Charlie Chan and others in a note. ""We believe that if NVIDIA accepted price hikes, other key AI semi customers may follow.""

""We think NVIDIA's management recognizes TSMC’s reliability, as it helps remove one of the largest risk factors – foundry production,"" Chan added.NVIDIA did not confirm the timing or amount of a wafer price increase.TSMC hiked its prices by 10% in 2022 and another 5% in 2023. Morgan Stanley believes TSMC could raise prices by another 5% for 2025, due to AI semi demand.

Other major TSMC customers include Apple (AAPL), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO), Qualcomm (QCOM) and MediaTek (OTCPK:2454-TK).""We believe TSMC will be a winner in AI semis in the long term,"" Chan noted. ""No matter where the growth is coming from – GPU or ASIC, cloud or edge AI chips – most, if not all, will likely be manufactured by TSMC's leading-edge foundry services.""Morgan Stanley rates TSMC Overweight, as most analysts are very bullish on the stock. Its price is up 55% year to date.",64,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1d9oox0/tsmc_ponders_boosting_ai_chip_production_prices/
2024-05-31 18:42:44,Apple,AAPL,This is how NVDA overtakes MSFT and AAPL to be the most valuable company in the world. ,"They develop their own operating system to compete with windows and macOS. 

Windows sucks, mac is whatever and no one uses linux. We need someone new to shake things up. Someone with a vision for the future and for what people want in a operating  system. 

-They have the hardware 
-They have the engineers
-They have the AI
-They can easily partner with a company like Dell to get their operating systems on their PCs.
-Develop their own app store
-Everything is in place for them to succeed.
-NVDA is a hardware and software company. 

Its pointless to sell before the split. Shorting Nvda also doesn't make sense with the PE being fairly low. ",0,47,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1d52w7y/this_is_how_nvda_overtakes_msft_and_aapl_to_be/

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2024-05-24 13:50:05,Apple,AAPL,Moving on from AAPL,"So, I had an excellent ride on AAPL for a good long bit, but bit a bit Meh on it concerning it's YTD performance , and what I see as a lot of lackluster reviews of it's recent product offerings and choices.  Thinner ipad, who cares?  New chip, no software yet to take advantage of it probably for the better part of a year.  Virt Reality, no killer app to drive it.  AI, they seem to be late in their development, although Apple has always been the greatest at their catchup/surpassing game.  I think there maybe better options for me, looking for a sounding board.  Still looking to keep it in steadily plodding behemoths for ease of mind, but something better than flat YTD performance i got out of apple this year.

First up MSFT, up 14% YTD, has a wide moat, seems to be well positioned for AI, although their gaming sector is looking kinda soft to me.  Like their latest offerings in pc with infused AI, and tablet.

Next up AMZN, up 21% YTD, also a wide moat, with a lot of stability in their supplied items and businesses.  Nothing really lights up the sky, just plodding along.  I think they have an AI strength used in their background business, but has an appearance of hiding, as it has no consumer face to it.

Lastly NVDA, up 110% YTD.  They are definitely the star of the moment, and I think there is still gas in this tank, but being a hardware vendor mostly with some software driven solutions for AI for their platform alone, they may have locked up a good lead that will only grow.

Looking at doing a 50/25/25 split (MSFT/AMZN/NVDA), thoughts?  Would love to hear any positive or negative on this.

2024-05-14 15:24:38,Apple,AAPL,"Comcast to bundle Peacock, Apple+ and Netflix. ","*Consumers will soon have access to* [*yet another streaming bundle*](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-streaming-wars-are-over-morning-brief-100018167.html)*. Comcast (*[*CMCSA*](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CMCSA)*) CEO Brian Roberts said early Tuesday that later this month, the company will launch a new offering that combines its Peacock platform, Netflix (*[*NFLX*](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NFLX/?fr=sycsrp_catchall)*), and Apple TV+ (*[*AAPL*](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/?fr=sycsrp_catchall)*).*

*The new bundle, referred to as StreamSaver, will be available to customers of Comcast’s broadband internet service, the executive revealed at a MoffettNathanson conference.*

*""Those three products will come at a vastly reduced price to anything in the market today and be available to all our customers,"" Roberts said. Exact pricing details will be announced at a later date.*

*""We've been bundling video successfully and creatively for 60 years,"" he added. ""This is the latest iteration of that, and I think this will be a pretty compelling package.""*

*The developments come as media companies face pressure from investors to scale their streaming services and achieve profitability. At the same time, the companies are dealing with more competition from tech giants like Amazon (*[*AMZN*](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN/?fr=sycsrp_catchall)*) and YouTube (*[*GOOGL*](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL)*,* [*GOOG*](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG)*), which are* [*gobbling up*](https://sports.yahoo.com/amazon-wins-nfl-playoff-game-025638395.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall) *streaming deals.*

*On average, US consumers subscribe to four streaming services and spend about $61 per month on them, according to the latest Digital Media Trends report from* [*Deloitte*](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/technology/digital-media-trends-consumption-habits-survey.html#streaming-video-at-a-crossroads)*. That means fewer opportunities for streamers to retain loyal subscribers over time.*

*The concept of bundling isn't new. Companies in the space have been doing it with their own services for years. Apple, for instance, offers Apple One, which combines Apple TV+ with other services like Apple Music and Apple Arcade. The bundle launched globally in late 2020.*

*Disney, which has also been offering a bundle with Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+,*[ *officially*](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/disney-begins-integrating-hulu-disney-170000387.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall) *began its domestic rollout of*[ *a one-app experience*](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/disneys-iger-pivots-on-hulu-stance-now-says-general-entertainment-very-positive-224831488.html) *late last year that incorporates Hulu content via Disney+ — a similar play to*[ *Paramount's Showtime combination*](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paramount-with-showtime-to-launch-june-27-184752031.html) *as well as the integration of*[ *HBO Max and Discovery+*](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warner-bros-discovery-launches-max-platform-in-bid-for-streaming-dominance-093040851.html)*, which both merged their respective services last year.*

*The move toward partnerships* [*among competing media companies*](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/streaming-bundles-a-new-era-has-arrived-154026983.html)*, though, has gained traction recently.*

*Just last week, Warner Bros. Discovery (*[*WBD*](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/WBD/)*) and Disney (*[*DIS*](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DIS/?fr=sycsrp_catchall)*)* [*announced a new streaming bundle*](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/disney-warner-bros-try-to-follow-the-consumer-with-yet-another-streaming-bundle-163529427.html) *that will bring together Disney+, Hulu, and Max streaming services, with a launch date set for this summer in the US.*

1. The Vision Pro was a dud, they’re pulling back manufacturing/production

2. iPhone sales are down almost 10%

3. Services didn’t grow as much as we thought they would

4. Apple doing a buyback instead of investing more in R&D (it seems like they’re doing a lot of buybacks lately..)

5. Slow growth in critical markets like China

6. No major product line releases in the future. The Vision Pro was a dud and was too expensive - they thought about doing a car but cancelled that. What’s the next new thing? 

Do I think Apple is doomed? Absolutely not. I love their products, especially the m series MacBooks.

But these points above are a little troubling. TBH I think Microsoft has a brighter future than AAPL. They hold a bigger grip/monopoly on commercial software.

>A landmark antitrust case pitting Google (GOOG, GOOGL) against the Justice Department entered its final stage this past week as prosecutors from the federal government and 14 states said in their closing arguments that Google illegally monopolized the online search and search advertising markets.

>A government win would certainly threaten a giant piece of Google’s $237.8 billion profit engine. But the outcome, which will be decided by US District Judge Amit Mehta in the weeks or months to come, also has giant implications for some of the other big names in the tech world.

>That's because Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) are defending themselves against a series of other federal- and state-led antitrust suits, some of which make similar claims, and because all three stand to lose or gain depending on the outcome.

>The government argues Google is violating Section 2 of the Sherman Act by blocking competitors from entering three distinct markets: general online search, search advertising, and search text advertising.

>A government win would put at risk the billions of dollars in mutually lucrative contracts between Google and Apple, as well as deals with other device manufacturers and telecom companies.

> The government alleged in its case that Google pays billions of dollars each year to LG, Motorola (MSI), and Samsung; major US wireless carriers such as AT&T (T), T-Mobile (TMUS), and Verizon (VZ); and browser developers such as Mozilla, Opera, and UCWeb.

>Government prosecutors have alleged that Google had been paying Apple an estimated $8 billion to $12 billion per year — a portion of search ad revenue — in exchange for awarding Google Search default placement on Apple devices.

>The government has yet to say what precise remedy it desires should it prevail against Google. If the government does win on any of its claims, a separate remedies phase of the trial would be held.",469,173,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ckv9wx/the_ending_of_googles_monopoly_trial_has_silicon/

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2024-05-02 20:32:20,Apple,AAPL,Apple announces largest-ever $110 billion share buyback as iPhone sales drop 10% ,"Apple reported fiscal second-quarter earnings on Thursday that were slightly higher than Wall Street expectations, but showed overall revenue down 4%, and iPhone sales falling 10%. 

Apple announced that its board had authorized $110 billion in share repurchases, the largest in the company’s history, and a 22% increase over last year’s $90 billion authorization.  

Here’s how Apple did versus LSEG consensus estimates in the March quarter: 

EPS: $1.53 vs. $1.50 estimated 

Revenue: $90.75 billion vs. $90.01 billion estimated 

iPhone revenue: $45.96 billion vs. $46.00 billion estimated 

Mac revenue: $7.5 billion vs. $6.86 billion estimated 

iPad revenue: $5.6 billion vs. $5.91billion estimated 

Other Products revenue: $7.9 billion vs. $8.08 billion estimated 

Services revenue: $23.9 billion vs. $23.27 billion estimated 

Gross margin: 46.6% vs. 46.6% estimated 

Apple did not provide formal guidance, but Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC’s Steve Kovach that overall sales would “grow low single digits” during the June quarter.  

Apple posted $81.8 billion in revenue during the year-ago June quarter and LSEG analysts were looking for a forecast of $83.23 billion.  

Apple reported $23.64 billion in net income, a 2% decrease from $24.16 billion in the year-earlier period. Overall sales fell 4% in the March quarter. 

Cook told CNBC’s Steve Kovach that year-over-year sales suffered from a difficult comparison to the year-ago period, when the company realized $5 billion in delayed iPhone 14 sales from Covid-based supply issues. 

“If you remove that $5 billion from last year’s results, we would have grown this quarter on a year-over-year basis,” Cook said. “And so that’s how we look at it internally from how the company is performing.” 

Apple said iPhone sales fell nearly 10% to $45.96 billion, suggesting weak demand for the current generation of iPhones, which were released in September. The sales were in-line with analyst estimates, and Cook said that without last year’s increased sales, iPhone revenue would have been flat.  

Mac sales were up 4% to $7.45 billion, but they are still below the segment’s high-water mark set in 2022. Cook said sales were driven by the company’s new MacBook Air models that were released with an upgraded M3 chip in March.  

Other Products, which is how Apple reports sales of its Apple Watch and AirPods headphones, was down 10% on an annual basis to $7.9 billion in revenue. 

During the quarter, Apple released its first new major product category in years, the Vision Pro virtual reality headset, but the $3500 device is expected to sell in low quantities, especially compared to Apple’s major product lines.  

“We’re only scratching the surface there so we couldn’t be more excited about our opportunity there,” Cook said. 

Apple has not released a new iPad since 2022, which is a drag on sales. Revenue for the division fell 17% to $5.6 billion. Apple is expected to announce new iPads on May 7 that could revive demand for the product line.  

Cook also said Apple has “big plans to announce” from an “AI point of view” during its iPad event next week as well as at the company’s annual developer conference in June.  

Services was a bright spot during the quarter. Sales rose 14.2% to $23.9 billion. That’s how Apple reports revenue from its subscription services, warranties, licensing deals with search engines, and payments. Apple has a broad definition of subscribers, which includes users subscribing to apps through Apple’s App Store, and said that it has over 1 billion paid subscriptions.  

Sales in Greater China, Apple’s third largest region, were off 8% to $17.8 billion in revenue, which was significantly better than the $15.25 billion in sales expected by FactSet analysts, potentially quelling investor worries that Apple may have been losing market share to local competitors such as Huawei.  

“I feel good about China, I think more about long term than to the next week or so,” Cook said. 

Cook told CNBC that iPhone sales grew in China during the quarter. “That may come as a surprise to some people,” Cook said.  

In addition to the buyback authorization, Apple said it would pay a 25 cent dividend, a one cent increase. Apple’s $110 billion buyback authorization is the largest-ever announced, ahead of Apple’s previous repurchases, according to data from Birinyi Associates.

2024-04-23 11:11:39,Apple,AAPL,Spotify turns a profit as earnings and revenue beat estimstes,"Spotify Technology (SPOT) reported fiscal first quarter earnings on Tuesday that beat expectations on both the top and bottom lines. The audio giant also swung to a profit as it continues to implement its recent ""efficiency"" strategy.

Over the past year, Spotify has committed to multiple rounds of layoffs in addition to price increases and other initiatives to boost top-line growth and improve margins. The company said it will be more intentional about future investments after spending billions on its push into the crowded podcast market.

The audio giant reported operating income of 168 million euros ($179 million), compared with a loss of 156 million euros in the prior-year period. This was below company guidance of 180 million euros as social charges came in higher than expected, ""driven by share price appreciation during the quarter"", according to Spotify.

It also guided to a strong Q2 operating income of 250 million euros, well ahead of Wall Street consensus expectations. Revenue guidance for the second quarter also came in ahead of estimates — 3.8 billion euros versus the 3.76 billion euros that was expected.

On top of more deliberate spending, Spotify will reportedly once again raise prices after hiking the cost of certain subscription plans last summer.

According to Bloomberg, Spotify plans to raise prices by about $1 to $2 a month in five markets, including the UK, Australia, and Pakistan. The changes are expected to come at the end of April, with US prices to rise ""later this year."" The report also said Spotify plans to introduce a cheaper option that does not include audiobooks.

The stock moved more than 9% higher in pre-market trading on Tuesday following the results.

The streaming service reported net income of 197 million euros ($210 million), or earnings of 0.97 euros per share. That was ahead of analyst expectations of earnings of 0.65 euros per share. It also compares with the year-earlier period loss of 225 million euros, or a loss of 1.16 euros a share.

Gross margins came in stronger than expected at 27.6%, beating company guidance of 26.4%. The streamer said it expects margins to tick up to 28.1% in the second quarter, primarily driven by year-over-year improvements in music and podcasting.

Spotify has previously said it expects the metric to come in between 30% and 35% over the long term amid plans to further scale its podcasting and ads business.

Revenue, meanwhile, totaled 3.64 billion euros ($3.88 billion) — 20% higher compared with the first quarter of 2023, and above Wall Street expectations of 3.61 billion euros.

User figures

Total monthly active users (MAUs) came in below company estimates of 618 million to hit 615 million in the quarter — but still a 19% improvement compared with the total in the year-ago period. The streaming service anticipates Q2 MAUs to come in at 631 million.

Premium subscribers met Wall Street expectations of 239 million — a 14% year-over-year jump. Spotify expects that subscriber count to increase to 245 million in the second quarter.

Free cash flow, another key metric for investors, came in at 207 million euros in the quarter compared to 57 million euros in the year-ago period.

The average revenue per user, or ARPU, for Premium subscriptions increased 7% to 4.55 euros (or 5% year over year, excluding foreign exchange headwinds.) ARPU was driven by price increase benefits that were partially offset by discounted plans and lower prices in emerging markets, the company said.

Profit pledge

Overall, analysts have been bullish on Spotify after the audio giant pledged to improve its profitability beginning in 2023 on a gross margin and operating income basis.

Spotify stock has surged more than 100% over the past year and is up 43% year to date.

Spotify spent $1 billion pushing into the podcast market over the past four years with splashy A-list deals and $400 million-plus studio acquisitions.

That spending took a significant bite out of gross margins and weighed heavily on profitability. In response, Spotify committed to several rounds of layoffs — three in 2023 alone.

Spotify CFO Paul Vogel stepped down from his position on March 31. He will be replaced by Christian Luiga, previously at Swedish aerospace and defense company Saab. Luiga will take over in the third quarter, the company said.

In addition to layoffs and price increases, Spotify also changed up its royalty structure, made audiobooks free to paying subscribers, and locked in new deals with popular podcasters like Joe Rogan and Alexandra Cooper of ""Call Her Daddy.""

The new deals come as Spotify further revamps its podcast strategy to focus more on distribution rather than exclusivity.

The audio giant announced that Rogan's podcast, its most popular on the platform, will be available on additional services like Apple Podcasts (AAPL), Amazon Music (AMZN), and YouTube (GOOGL) for the first time in years. Spotify will handle distribution and ad sales as it works to maximize revenue. Rogan will receive a guaranteed minimum rate and cut of the advertising revenue.

Cooper's ""Call Her Daddy"" deal will have a similar structure with the podcast now available on all major audio platforms after more than two years as a Spotify exclusive. The company will maintain the exclusive rights to the podcast's video portion.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2024-04-04 01:02:49,Apple,AAPL,Dell’s stock is at a new high — and it has beaten Apple’s over a five-year span,"What’s old is new again, at least from Wall Street’s perspective.

Dell Technologies Inc. DELL, +8.56% was a hot company around the turn of the century, as it leapt ahead in the fast-moving race to sell personal computers. The company became the top-selling computer-systems provider globally in 2001.

The brand lost some of its cachet as the years went on, and as Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.48% began to see more traction in the personal-computer market. But Dell seems cool again in the artificial-intelligence era, and investors are taking notice.

The stock closed up 8.6% in Wednesday trading to hit $128.58. That marked a new all-time closing high for the shares, their first in about a month.

Read: Apple’s stock has faltered, but a Steve Jobs moment in AI may be on the horizon

Dell’s stock has enjoyed an explosive recent run, rising 67% so far in 2024 and advancing 214% over the past year. And its performance over a longer span as been notable as well, especially on a relative basis: Dell shares are up 309% over a five-year period, while Apple’s stock is ahead 245%.

Wall Street has a new appreciation for Dell thanks to the company’s position as a backbone of the AI revolution. The shares enjoyed their best day on record in early March, as the company showed rapid shipment growth for its AI-optimized servers. AI-hardware titan Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.55% even gave Dell a prominent shoutout at its recent GTC developer event.

“While the company has been through prior technology cycles (server virtualization, public cloud, mobile, etc.), one key difference for AI is that it appears to be incremental” to the total addressable market, Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a mid-March note to clients. Earlier shifts in the tech landscape meant that newer technologies displaced legacy ones to an extent, he added.

It is not clear what the focus of the charges would be, but makers of hardware devices, like smart-tracker maker Tile, have long complained that Apple has restricted the ways in which they can work with the iPhone's sensors while developing competing products that have greater access.

Apple began selling AirTags - which can be attached to items like car keys to help users find them when they are lost - several years after Tile had been selling a similar product.

Late in February, Bloomberg News had reported that Apple representatives met with Justice Department officials in a bid to persuade the agency not to file an antitrust suit against the iPhone maker.

A new antitrust suit against Apple would be the third by the Justice Department in the past 14 years, but it is the first case accusing the iPhone maker of illegally maintaining its dominant position, Bloomberg reported.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2024-03-14 12:56:52,Apple,AAPL,Tesla (TSLA) DCF Analysis,"***NOTE: NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE***

# Introduction:

TSLA is the world's most renowned Electric Vehicle(EV) automaker, catalyzing the world's acceleration towards Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) Vehicles. TSLA has become the gold standard for what a high-quality EV stands for, all thanks in part to their founder's vision and belief in renewable energy especially during the tumultuous early years of TSLA. TSLA no longer just stands for EV but renewable energy, having branched out into Energy Storage, and Solar Panels.  TSLA hopes to create an ecosystem for renewable energy from charging to energy storage to the vehicle used, all this tied together by dedicated software created by TSLA at every point of contact in the ecosystem. This ecosystem business model has seen massive success as evident from businesses like GOOG, AAPL, and MSFT. I believe the next frontier of growth for TSLA comes from energy storage rather than automotive, however automotive will still account for the largest chunk of revenue for TSLA.

# Market:

TSLA's closest EV competitor is BYD. TSLA has won BYD on almost every front. A country where BYD has managed to wrest control from TSLA is Thailand. So I'll analyze this market specifically to rationalize why I believe this victory will be shortlived.

In Thailand, the top 3 most popular car models are BYD Atto 3, Netta V, and BYD Dolphin ([SOURCE](https://carnewschina.com/2024/01/09/byd-is-bestselling-ev-brand-in-thailand-in-2023-neta-is-runner-up/)).   

|Model|Price|Range|
|:-|:-|:-|
|BYD Atto 3|1.1M Baht|521 km/charge|
|Neta V|0.55M Baht|380 km/charge|
|BYD Dolphin|0.75M Baht|427 km/charge|
|Tesla Model 3|1.59M Baht|513 km/charge|

In Thailand, 60.17% of the population owns a car ([SOURCE](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1027960/thailand-car-ownership-among-consumers/)) with the average car price being about 0.78M Baht. This means that a Tesla Model 3, TSLA's cheapest model is double the average price of a normal car in Thailand. 

[SOURCE](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1030220/thailand-average-monthly-income-per-household-by-region/)) which means that the Tesla Model 3 is a luxury good rather than an affordable commodity for the average household. The difference in price between BYD and Tesla is a full year's worth of income for the average household which leads the price-conscious consumers in Thailand to naturally gravitate towards BYD, hence the popularity of BYD over Tesla in Thailand.   
  
Ultimately, I do believe that if TSLA continues competing on quality and finds ways to cut costs such as directly setting up factories in Thailand ([SOURCE](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/03/05/business/thailand-tesla-factory-talks-intl-hnk/index.html)), it will be able to close the price gap with BYD. As ""people are really stretching their wallets to be able to afford a Tesla. It’s quite a difficult thing for them to do, and remarkable that it’s the best-selling car in unit volume, despite being much more expensive than other high-volume cars.” - 2023 Q4 Earnings Conference

# Revenue:

TSLA has 5 revenue channels, namely “Automotive Sales”, “Services and Others”, “Automotive Lease”, “Automotive Regulatory Credit” and “Energy Generation and Storage sales”. 

***Automotive Sales***

Automotive sales refers to the direct sale of TSLA’s vehicles fully paid upfront.

Elon Musk believes that manufacturing capabilities will be the most important C.A. for TSLA. “perhaps the most important competitive characteristic of Tesla in the future will be manufacturing technology” -  2023 Q4 Earnings Conference. 

When forecasting the Number of Vehicles each Gigafactory can produce, I took into account that Elon Musk recently unveiled in the 2023 Q4 Earnings conference that there is a new revolutionary manufacturing technology that is expected to drastically improve production. He hopes to pilot test this technology at the Texas Gigafactory to produce their low-cost EV before proceeding to replicate the technology in every Gigafactory. “the sensible way to go about things is kind of figure out the core technology of the manufacturing line and then replicate it with improvements throughout the world.” -  2023 Q4 Earnings Conference. So, in my first 3 years, I assume that the growth rate is below historical averages as TSLA tests out new technology in preparation for the launch of the low-cost EV. I assumed that TSLA’s manufacturing technology was successful.  
  
When forecasting %Vehicles delivered, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historical averages  
  
When forecasting Avg Price/Vehicles Delivered, Elon Musk doesn’t believe in price increases to increase the topline. As evident in 2021 and 2022 where Elon Musk only increased prices due to supply chain constraints before bringing prices back down in 2023. In China, Elon Musk ended up cutting prices due to being able to source significantly cheaper batteries there. I assumed that over time as TSLA enjoys sufficient economies of scale, they will only increase prices in line with perpetual inflation.  


***Services and Others***

TSLA provides a few services such as home servicing in certain regions or customers pay to access TSLA’s network of SuperChargers.  
  
Lifetime number of TSLA automobile (Ex roadster) delivered ([SOURCE](https://backlinko.com/tesla-stats))

Assuming that TSLA is properly maintained they can last \~20 years ([SOURCE](https://caredge.com/blog/how-long-tesla-batteries-last)). Opting for less granularity, in my forecast I assumed the total lifetime number of tesla cars remained constant without any churn.

When forecasting Services and Others, Opting for less granularity I assumed that the servicing’s pricing grew following the price of the vehicle in line with historic averages. 

  
***Automotive Lease***

TSLA has 2 types of lease, “Direct Vehicle Operations Lease” which leases out vehicles to customers for up to 48 months afterwards the vehicle is returned to TSLA. “Direct Sales Lease” either granting the customer title of the vehicle once full payment has been made or the customer has the option of refusing the vehicle.  
  
When forecasting Automotive leasing, as prices for TSLA fell in 2023, Automotive leasing as a percentage of Automotive Sales dropped as it is now cheaper for customers to purchase their tesla in 1 lump sum payment. I assumed that following this trend, as TSLA’s affordability increases over time the %Automotive Sales decreases as well before remaining constant in perpetuity.

  
***Automotive Regulatory Credit***

TSLA has excess carbon credit which it sells to competitors.

“It will continue for some period of time, but eventually this stream of regulatory credits will reduce.” ([SOURCE](https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-9-billion-revenue-selling-regulatory-credits-to-other-carmakers-2024-2)).  


When forecasting Automotive Regulatory Credit, given that TSLA does not intend to depend on these credits for revenue, I assume that as a %of Automotive sales, credit will contribute to a significantly lesser amount in perpetuity. This is further exacerbated by other automobile companies accelerating their push towards EVs as countries begin phasing out ICE vehicles. So, more companies begin having excess regulatory credits as well. Ultimately, I believe that leading up to 2030 the amount of revenue contributed by Regulatory credits decreases to a significant level. 

  
***Energy Generation and Storage Sales***

TSLA produces Energy Storage systems e.g. Megapack and Solar Energy related products e.g. Solar Panels which it directly sells to customers.  
  
For energy storage more specifically megapacks, as the world phases out ICE vehicles and begins embracing renewable energy, it leads to a surge in demand for electricity. However, the issue with renewable energy is that “The most common renewable energy sources like the sun and wind are intermittent or have lower baseload capabilities than coal, natural gas, or nuclear sources. This makes it necessary to have a way to conserve excess energy produced during peak hours. This extra energy can then be supplied through the grid or otherwise when the sun is down, or wind speed reduces.” ([SOURCE](https://www.batterycycle.io/why-is-tesla-focusing-on-the-battery-energy-storage-market/)). As an example to elaborate on how much importance is placed on energy storage, China mandates that all renewable energy facilities must store at least 20% of their total output ([SOURCE](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiYquPrkuaEAxXuSGwGHffzBkgQFnoECA0QAw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Ferikkobayashisolomon%2F2023%2F12%2F20%2Fenergy-vault-wins-big-with-gravity-storage-in-china%2F%23%3A~%3Atext%3DChina%2520has%2520mandated%2520that%2520all%2Cgeneration%2520capacity%27s%2520worth%2520of%2520storage.&usg=AOvVaw3WMq0w9-2ka0Cz2kAGbCWX&opi=89978449)).  
  
The closest competitor to TSLA in energy pack is BYD. The TSLA’s megapack is smaller in dimensions compared to BYD and on top of that TSLA has built its own software to be compatible with the megapack hardware with features such as Autobidder (Software to optimize energy trading) and Powerhub.  
  
Right now what's stopping revenue for energy storage is production capacity, TSLA opened its megapack factory in Lathrop to curb this. TSLA has also announced its plans to build a megapack factory in China to assist with production capacity ([SOURCE](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-22/tesla-acquires-land-for-shanghai-megapack-battery-factory)). As an overarching goal for my forecast, I took into account the TSLA master plan 3.  
  
When forecasting number of dedicated megapack factories opened, I assumed that TSLA would open 1 additional plant every 3 years for the next 10 years, to meet the large surge in demand as countries accelerate their push towards renewable energy.  
  
When forecasting Max Output/Factory, taking into account this article on expected output. ([SOURCE](https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2023/11/tesla-megapack-factory-production-limit-solved-and-capacity-will-be-doubled-to-80-gwh.html)). TSLA’s Lathrop Megapack factory can produce 80GWh/Year in part due to them doubling their existing lines and resolving certain issues. Over time I believe that TSLA can massively increase the Max Output/Factory, as TSLA consistently touts their innovations as having an S curve of progression, where progress is slower at the earlier stages before exponentially increasing.   
As a sanity check, in my base case assuming that all Mega packs are still at 4 MWh. TSLA has to produce 406,200 Mega Packs or 81,240 Mega Pack per factory a year by 2038. As of November 2023, the Lathrop factory can produce 20,000 megapack. So, in 15 years I believe it is a reasonable amount of time necessary for TSLA to ramp up their production 4x.  
  
When forecasting %GWh Deployed, I had to assume total output which is a function of max output and the number of gigafatories. I assumed that over the years as more countries begin phasing out ICE vehicles in favor of EVs, there is a larger need to deploy more energy storage so this % increases to a large extent.  
  
When forecasting Avg Sales/GWh Deployed, Elon Musk does not like to increase sales through increasing pricing which was why when TSLA enjoyed economies of scale from increasing output in their Lathrop factory the Avg Sales/GWh Deployed decreased. So, applying this principle of TSLA slashing prices when costs decrease due to economies of scale, I assumed that TSLA continued slashing prices before increasing by the perpetual inflation rate.

# Cost:

“predicting auto gross margins is extremely challenging since there are many moving parts to this equation, some of which are out of our control like the change in tariffs or local incentives to name a few. While the teams are focused on cost reductions, we are approaching the limits within our current platforms.” - 2023 Q4 Earnings Conference. 

  
When forecasting Automotive and Non-Automtoive COGS, COGS as a %revenue for 2021 and 2022 are likely to be lower due to TSLA pre-emptively increasing sales price to deal with inflation. However, in 2023 COGS as a %revenue increased as TSLA cut back on sales price. Going forward, I’ll assume that TSLA tends towards historic pre-covid average. However, in the long run, as TSLA successfully implements their manufacturing technology this % will decrease even further.  
When forecasting R&D, SG&A, and Others, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic averages.

# WACC:

US 10Y T-Bond (1M Avg) = 4.12%  
Beta ([SOURCE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/)) = 2.41  
Stable Market ERP ([SOURCE](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/ctryprem.html)) = 4.60%  
COE = 15.21%  
   
TSLA is rated at BAA3 ([SOURCE](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DBAA))  
COD (1M Avg) = 5.72%  
Marginal Tax Rate = 21.00%  
AT-COD = 4.52%  
  
Market Price (5D Avg) = $178.50  
Shares O/S = 3184.79M  
Market Value of Equity = 568485.02M  
  
Weighted Average Maturity = 2 Years  
FY23 Interest Expense = 156M  
Market Value of Debt = 4578.78M  
%Debt = 0.80%  
%Equity = 99.20%  
WACC = 15.12%  
  
Currently, TSLA has a very large beta as its stock has increased in volatility in the past few years. However, I believe that this volatility will not persist for very long as most big tech stocks enter a stable stage where their beta tends downwards. So, as a proxy for how low TSLA’s beta will tend to, I looked at other big tech stocks.



|Name|Beta|
|:-|:-|
|Google (GOOG)|1.04|
|Microsoft (MSFT)|0.89|
|Meta (META)|1.21|

Taking the average beta, we arrive at a beta of 1.05. Assuming similar D/E composition and bond rating. I assumed that it took another 10 years for TSLA to reach the stable state.  
  
Stable State COE = 8.95%  
Stable State AT-COD = 4.52%  
TSLA’s stable stage WACC = 8.90%  


# Conclusion:

Ultimately in my base case, I value TSLA at $186.88 per share. I believe that there is still room for TSLA to grow, having such a strong first movers advantage in the renewable energy market means that TSLA is heads and shoulders above its competitors. I believe that the market is undervaluing the Energy Storage arm of TSLA's business, and less emphasis is placed on this potentially disruptive segment of business.

2024-03-11 09:33:53,Apple,AAPL,Why Apple simply doesn't provide a cloud service?,"With AAPL growing now at what I consider to be a  ""GDP premium rate"" ~ 5% and with the iphone growth slowing down, what is left now for Apple is to capitalize on its services. This is now under attack in the EU. I am not a financial specialist but as a European I do however foresee a hard time for Apple to grow services revenue in the EU. Now that Apple has to offer search choices, that revenue with Google might also see some decline. With the self-driving car cancelled, it is hard to picture any sectors where Apple could still push double digit growth. VisionPro? too expensive at the moment, it would still to be at least in the $1000 range for the mass. While we have seen positive news on the tech, it is still unknown how many people who bought the device hasn't yet returned it.

GenAI? They reshuffled the entire team working on Titan to focus on GenAI. How is that possible? are the skills really transferable? Vision Problem != LLM but again not an expert.

This led me to wonder, why isn't Apple competing in the cloud business? I don't mean like AWS or Azure but for its developers? When a developer onboard on IOS, they make use of the store and the SDK but all cloud services the app uses is running somewhere else. Wouldn't Apple be able to justify 30%+ cut of the developer's revenue if part of the deal was access to Apple cloud infrastructure to run the App services?

Do you guys think this is far fetched? What other sectors do you guys think Apple can still tap in to to go back to double digit growth?

Leadership wise, i am a bit split. Post Steve Jobs, all they had truly done was innovate on the iPhone and in a way that phone was conceptualized during Steve's time. So what exactly did Tim Cook do? I would still pick Tim Cook over Sundar but he is not Satya who was more of an opportunist that turned Microsoft around.

Anyway, lots of questions and a bit of a rant. Curious what you geniuses think of what lies ahead of the big Apple.",259,186,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bbz8zd/why_apple_simply_doesnt_provide_a_cloud_service/

2024-03-05 13:00:28,Apple,AAPL,AI Madness and profitablity,"This isn't a post about AI bubble or why the chip and cloud hardware supplier is on a nutty uptrend. Their revenue in cases like NVDA has grew 120%+ YoY with insane profit margin, and since market is short sighted, it makes sense why the insane run. Lot of people kicking themselves for not see this coming, or someone like me who saw it coming but exited earlier because couldn’t value the “shovel” correctly in this gold rush.   
Now lets take a step back and look at this trend from a different angle. Main buyers are the big 5 Google, OpenAI, META, AAPL, AMZN, MSFT (GOMAM).  
In order for your you all to understand my next points we all first have to agree on few basic things  
**1). Companies have FINITE capex amount**  
**2). Every company at the end of the day WANTS to make money**  
**3). Every company wants to find a way to REDUCE their capex and still grow**  
For point #2, the way these company will eventually make money is by selling the products to consumer and business. So in next 5-10 years we will see leap in software and services innovations. We will see so many new small and midsize companies using these applications to build more complex solutions on cloud. Now take your guess who will benefit the most from this? if your answer is GOMAM, thats correct. If your answer is NVDA then you are an idiot.   
I would say point #1 and point #3 go hand in hand, we are seeing lot of capex diverted within the company itself. So to no surprise, GOMAM are already building and some have built their own silicon. Its just matter of time when they start to reduce their exposure to external company. This isn’t to say that NVDA will ever become irrelevant. The point is they will always have to outgrow and justify for GOMAM to spend their capex on them. This is the bet you are making for going LONG nvidia at these valuation. Because again, market is short sighted, they are seeing 6-12 month guidance and pumping.  
Now i am seeing crazy amount of doom and gloom for companies like AAPL and GOOG lately on reddit and also on media. I just have one question, that goes to #2. How do you guys think every software and services that will leverage these new silicon will reach the end users? Think for a second form a consumer standpoint. They don’t know wtf is NVDA, AMD. All they know is smartphones, tablets, wearable, laptops. I am not saying where you should invest your money. I am just saying don’t go with the trend like a madman. if you miss the shovel rush, you can still make plenty of money on factories that will make gold products for end users.   
**in summary,**   
**I see there is more value in going long on GOMAAM (Added AAPL) than NVDA,AMD**",96,78,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b74mw7/ai_madness_and_profitablity/

I Google'd ""AAPL stock"" to see how it was doing, and the first news link was from ""The Motley Fool"" titled *""Warren Buffett Sells Apple Shares. Should You Follow His Lead?""* ([link](https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/02/26/warren-buffett-sells-apple-shares-should-you-follo/)). As an investor in the AAPL stock, I was a bit concerned and wanted to check the article out.

The article mentions that ""Berkshire Hathaway sold some AAPL shares"". This made me actually go look at the form 13F to see what ""some"" means.  


In the Q4 2023 13F, Berkshire Hathaway owned 905,560,000 shares of AAPL. ([source](https://13f.info/13f/000095012324002518-berkshire-hathaway-inc-q4-2023))  
In the Q3 2023 13F, they owned 915,560,382 shares of AAPL. ([source](https://13f.info/13f/000095012323011029-berkshire-hathaway-inc-q3-2023-restatement))  


This means, ""some"" equals 1.092%.  


Also, AAPL still accounts for 50.19% of their total investment portfolio, down from 50.04% compared to the previous filing which is a 0.29% relative decrease.",419,79,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b1fbiz/psa_for_people_subscribed_to_the_motley_fool/

2024-02-15 12:25:08,Apple,AAPL,Google (GOOG) DCF Analysis,"**NOTE NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE**

# Introduction:

GOOG has a very simplistic goal in their business, yet this simple goal managed to carry GOOG's market cap to a trillion dollar. GOOG's main business model is centered around helping consumers sieve through large chunks of data to find what they need or want to find. Recently, with the announcement of Gemini, GOOG's GenAI, it led to a temporary spike in stock prices as investors believed that Gemini would be able to compete with ChatGPT. I believe that the advancement of GenAI is necessary for GOOG given how reliant they are on Search revenue.

# Revenue:

The success of GOOG’s advertising is hinged on 2 criteria, being able to attract and retain users and being able to monetize advertisers.

***For attracting and retaining users,***

1. GOOG released Gemini their generative AI to help complement Search. This allows users to process information faster or seek answers more efficiently.
2. GOOG has entered into a deal with AAPL to make Google the default search engine on Safari. This deal is estimated to be worth about 18 billion per year.
3. There is a large switching cost for long-term users to switch over to a rival search engine. This is so because using the Google search engine means that there is a high chance users will be indoctrinated into the GOOG ecosystem (E.g. Gmail, Google Drive, etc.).

***For monetizing advertisers,***

1. GOOG is one of the largest platforms that advertisers can advertise on. The type of information that users receive is dependent on GOOG, GOOG controls the information flow to consumers and hence is a powerful platform for advertisers to advertise on.

Apart from these factors, GOOG has begun targeting SMBs (Small and Midsize Businesses).

How GOOG sees SMBs (Small, Medium Businesses) advertising with them is that GOOG will provide Gen AI to generate images/captions for their ad campaign then SMBs use these advertising materials and advertise on Search.

When forecasting advertising revenue, opting for less granularity, and due to a lack of public data, I lumped both search and YouTube together. Taking the number of YouTube users as a proxy for the popularity of GOOG’s advertising tools.

So, I assumed that it would take 1 year for GOOG to finish and get Gemini up to speed. I assumed that it takes about 2 years for consumers to get used to Gemini and for advertisers to notice this shift. This quick adaptation is because ChatGPT took off very quickly within the year it was released.

When forecasting revenue/users, due to the macro constraints and pessimism advertisers are cautious about advertising so the revenue/users have been dropping for the past 2 years. I assume it takes 2 years for the macro outlook to improve and during the high growth period, revenue/users grow as well as more advertisers start spending more.

&#x200B;

When forecasting Google Subscriptions + Others, which entails YouTube premium, GOOG devices, and Google Play revenue. I assumed that the success of this category is based on YouTube Premium so I forecasted this revenue segment based on the number of subscribers to YouTube Premium. Number of Subscribers in 2022 ([SOURCE](https://www.billboard.com/business/streaming/youtube-music-premium-subscribers-how-many-1235594920/#:~:text=That's%20up%20from%20the%2080,at%20the%20end%20of%202021)). Comparing Youtube Music to its strongest competitor Spotify, Spotify has a large switching cost due to years worth of playlists built that would be lost by switching over. On top of that, having to learn the new UI of YouTube Music and the lack of certain features that Spotify users are used to.So, the main driver for this segment would be YouTube Premium, given the indispensable nature of YouTube due to the strong network effect and new frontiers such as YouTube Shorts that are driving people to YouTube, and the longer unskippable ads, all these factors are driving people to subscribe to YouTube Premium. However, I’m cautious about how much or how fast YouTube Premium will grow. Due to strong competitors such as TikTok and Spotify, I’d assume the historic large growth will taper downwards as the high historic growth was due to the low-hanging fruits being picked.

&#x200B;

When forecasting Revenue/Users, as GOOG wants to keep their prices low to attract users to YouTube Premium, historically the revenue/users have been declining. However, as recently as July 2023 GOOG started hiking prices. So, I’d assume that in my forecast from FY24 onwards, the Revenue/Users begin rising.  Historic price hikes have been at around 16%, I’d assume that GOOG no longer pursues such aggressive price rises and begins tapering down their price increases. Their perpetual Revenue/users growing in line with the perpetual inflation rate.

&#x200B;

When forecasting Google Cloud revenue, since there isn’t available relevant data to create a bottoms-up revenue model I forecasted it as Y/Y growth. Taking into account ([SOURCE](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/cloud-computing-industry)). Given that GOOG mainly offers IAAS and SAAS for cloud computing, as businesses begin ramping up their digital efforts in line with the global push towards digitalization there is an increasing demand for IAAS and SAAS cloud computing, especially for IAAS which is stated to have the highest growth rate. I assumed that GOOG’s cloud revenue grew at a Y/Y CAGR of 19.3%.

# Cost:

When forecasting COGS, TAC accounted for about 40% of COGS as per 2023 10-K. I assumed that TAC would tend slightly upwards due to the competition for traffic increasing from competitors such as TikTok.

When forecasting R&D and marketing, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic averages.

When forecasting G&A, management has stated that there is a potential usage of AI to reduce the need for labor. I’d assume that G&A tends downward slightly.

# WACC:

RFR (1M Avg) = 4.14%

Beta ([SOURCE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG/)) = 1.06

Stable market ERP ([SOURCE](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/ctryprem.html)) = 4.60%

COE = 9.02%

GOOG has a bond rating of AA ([SOURCE](https://www.moodys.com/credit-ratings/Google-Inc-credit-rating-820429365?lang=es-ar&cy=arg#:~:text=Moody's%20assigns%20Aa2%20rating%20to%20Google's%20senior%20unsecured%20debt))

AA bond yield (1M Avg) = 4.80%

Marginal Tax rate = 21.00%

AT-COD = 3.79%

Stock price (5D Avg) = $147.05

Shares O/S = 12433M

Market Value of Equity = 1828272.65M

Weighted Average Debt = 10 Years

FY23 Interest Expense = 308M

Market Value of Debt = 12769.72M

%Debt = 0.007%

%Equity = 99.003%

WACC = 8.93%

# 

Conclusion:

Ultimately, in my base case, I value GOOG at $143.16 per share. I believe that GOOG is a company with strong growth potential. However, given that GOOG is a household name and especially with the recent hype when they announced gemini it has led to a lot of enthusiasm and bullish outlook that caused their prices to temporarily spike upwards.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Anyone who was around at the time can testify that this really did represent consensus opinions in this sub at that time, which you can see in the comments of that post.  Note that the game store madness did not really begin until a couple weeks later, which is why it did not appear here.

I felt like it was going to play out poorly so I bookmarked it, and now have been doing yearly updates to see how the sharp, financial geniuses of the time did.  After all, for something like this, you really need to give it a multiple year timeline at least.  All 2024 prices use the closing price Friday.

2024-01-14 21:49:52,Apple,AAPL,An Exploration of Analyst Ratings and Stock Market Bias,"TLDR - Potential heavy bias on aggregated ratings towards buy/outperform ratings with virtually no sell/underperform ratings on aggregate. Is this justified in your opinion?  
Hello everyone,  
I’ve embarked on an interesting project recently. I wanted to build a neural network model. The goal? To analyze stock data (fundamentals and price data) from Thompson Reuters and respective analyst ratings.  
The idea was to identify companies that are either unrated or not followed by analysts, and use the model to assign them theoretical ratings. Additionally, I wanted to spot companies with changing fundamentals that are likely to be re-rated soon, potentially leading to significant price movements.  
My dataset primarily consists of US-listed stocks across major exchanges and pink slips. However, it also includes stocks listed on the Frankfurt and London stock exchanges, as these are the three regions where I trade/invest. For more international exposure, I use ETFs.  
In total, my investable universe comprises around 17-18K stocks, with 7624 of them having an analyst following. Thompson Reuters provides a “score” from 1-5 for each stock, where 1 is a strong buy/overperform and 5 is a sell.  
To quickly clarify and avoid any confusion this initial test is only for aggregated ratings for stocks for example AAPL was recently given a downgrade by Barclays which led to it losing a considerable amount of market cap. However, the aggregate rating given for AAPL is still a ""Buy"".  
On aggregate, there’s a heavy skew to the upside, as seen below:  
Rating Number Percentage  
Hold 1488 19.5%  
Buy 3882 50.9%  
Overperform 2120 27.8%  
Underperform 117 1.5%  
Sell 17 0.2%  
This leads me to question the validity of these results. Should nearly 80% of stocks have a buy or outperform rating? Especially in a market that is relatively/historically quite expensive, this seems incredibly high.  
While I wouldn’t trade/buy based on any given analyst ratings, this project was more of a fun side venture. However, I’m somewhat disappointed with the results of this data-gathering stage, as any model trained in this way will be heavily biased and statistically insignificant unless you believe that the analysts on aggregate are correct.  
I plan to start gathering this data over time, but unless something significant happens to the economy, I’m not sure if the aggregate data will be that interesting, other than indicating a potential heavy bias.  
My next step is to examine the individual numbers for each stock in terms of the number of buys/holds/sells, etc., and see if I can derive something more meaningful to model as well as maybe try and explore the validity of the aggregated ratings. I enjoy creating models, even if they’re not always for practical purposes.  
This exploration has shown why downgrades seem to hit a company a lot harder than upgrades.  
I’d love to hear your thoughts on analyst ratings/reports in general as well as if you think that analyst ratings are justified or not.",16,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/196rajd/an_exploration_of_analyst_ratings_and_stock/
2024-01-14 16:47:14,Apple,AAPL,Is it normal for the index funds to be weighted this heavily by mega caps?,"For reference, I have positions in both QQQ, VOO, and an American Capital Group Index Fund. I looked at the top 10 holdings of each and they were all very similar: META, AMZN, Alphabet,

The world's largest contract chipmaker, whose customers include Apple (AAPL.O) and Nvidia (NVDA.O), has benefited from a boom in artificial intelligence applications that has helped it weather the tapering off of pandemic-led demand.  
Revenue in the final three months of last year came in at T$625.5 billion ($20.10 billion), according to Reuters calculations, compared with $19.93 billion in the year-ago period.

That beat Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co's (TSMC) previous prediction for fourth-quarter revenue being in a range of between $18.8-19.6 billion, and also beat an LSEG SmartEstimate of T$617.1 billion drawn from 21 analysts.

2024-01-02 22:45:10,Apple,AAPL,Deciding REITS for my portfolio. But lack the confidence in knowing how to valuate each choice.,"Obviously I want the best to profit the most and don't want to waste time trying learn through experience unless I have the tools to do it efficiently.

I am trying to be a combination of investing types or styles. First is Core and Satellite Investing,  GARP Investing, and Passive Aggressive Investing.

My Portfolio so far is QQQM, AMZN, AAPL, and GLD.

The list of REITS I am trying to decide on adding to the portfolio is this

They all provide monthly dividends because of my preference.

* Realty Income Corporation (O) (I know O is popular choice with its consistent growing dividends)
* Stag Industrial, Inc. (STAG)
* EPR Properties (EPR)
* LTC Properties, Inc. (LTC)
* Global Net Lease, Inc. (GNL)
* Gladstone Commercial Corporation (GOOD)

I have some google sheets made by someone online that I bought for cheap to find good stocks by different stock model valuations. But the person has a reit valuation model and a stock valuation model.

This makes me uncertain since I would want it to be O but I don't want to be bias because of the hype of a single stock.

From my REIT model GNL and GOOD are considered a buy. while the rest at the moment are considered a sell.

But compared to stock valuation O, STAG, EPR, and LTC are considered a buy

This leaves me uncertain is GNL and GOOD considered undervalued? or are both valuation models ineffective?

Then I try using finviz screener and STAG is the only one to show some good fundamentals.

What am I supposed to be looking at fundamentally?

Is there a difference for fundamentals for a reit versus a common stock?

I understand fundamentals as far as personal experience and having a major in finance. But I am seeking reassurance as for what values , ratios, and other data. I should be looking at to find profitable opportunities to buy.

&#x200B;

This is what I have been told to pay attention to or learned online.  All of these fundamentals are from FINVIZ because that is my main stock screener.

P/E , PEG, P/S, P/B, Price/ cash, Price/FCFF, eps growth past 5 years, dividend yield, debt to equity, and operating margin.

I am seeking reassurance or help for me to understand this better. I am honestly just being lazy and just want to make sure I am learning the correct or important stuff. 

&#x200B;

edit: I learned a little bit of fundamentals but not much. It is just smarter to go towards the benchmark since a stock would not be capable of consistently beating the benchmark.  so this helped narrow down my choices with  new ones

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

2023-12-19 10:39:22,Apple,AAPL,"Is Tesla the Ultimate Investment? Garry Breaks Down the Numbers, Growth, and Unveils the EV Game-Changer!","According to Garry, Investment advisor,Tesla ($TSLA) currently sits at $250 per share, trading at 58 times his estimated 2024 Adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $4.30. Garry's take on this? He believes it's a reasonable valuation, especially when considering the projected +28% increase in volume and an impressive +32% growth in EPS between now and 2030. This positions Tesla's Price/Earnings-to-Growth (PEG) ratio at 1.8x, notably lower than Apple's ($AAPL) 3.0x PEG.

Garry's outlook extends to global EV adoption, forecasting a rise from the current 13% to a substantial 60% by 2030, sporting a +24% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CGR). With faith in the Cybertruck and Tesla's $25,000 next-gen vehicle, Garry expects Tesla to boost its global EV market share from 16% to 20% by 2030. The outcome? Tesla's vehicle volumes surging from 1.8 million in 2023 to 2.4 million in 2024 and an impressive 10.2 million by 2030 (+28% CGR).

Factoring in aspects like auto gross margin expansion, contributions from energy, operating leverage, and cash reinvestment, Garry foresees Tesla's Adjusted EPS climbing from $3.20 in 2023 to $22 in 2030 (+32% CGR). Interestingly, Garry's projections don't include potential revenues from Full Self-Driving (FSD) licensing, robotaxi ventures, or other futuristic elements. However, they do consider FSD at a 15% global take rate and energy revenues rising by a factor of eight.

The central question, as per Garry's analysis, is whether a P/E ratio of 58x is too steep for the premier EV player, set to experience a +28% CGR in volume and +32% CGR in EPS. Garry challenges you to find another mega-cap stock with this level of growth and valuation, particularly with traditional automakers pulling back from their EV commitments. In his view, Tesla stands out as the primary investment opportunity in the evolving EV landscape.",0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18lyz17/is_tesla_the_ultimate_investment_garry_breaks/

I am looking to hold companies that have the highest average rankings in the following traits and market cap weight across the top 100 ranked companies:

&#x200B;

* Low Debt
* Low Dilution
* High growth on a per share basis
* High gross margins
* High Return on Assets (Gross Profit / Assets - Marketable investments)

High Yield of Gross Profit / (Market Cap - Marketable Investments)

Every quarter it re ranks the securities and targets the top 100 ranked securities based on the above critera that are in the Russell 1000 index. Portfolio123 also adjusts for look ahead bias, spin offs, delistings, etc.

The company consistently outperforms its peers and is one of only five US companies valued at over $1 trillion. Notably, on December 6, 2023, Apple surpassed a $3 trillion total market valuation.   
  
Throughout 2023, Apple increased its market cap by $1 trillion, reaching a total valuation of $4 trillion expected in 2024 if the pace continues.   
  
Other companies with over $1 trillion valuations include Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Nvidia. The gap between Apple and Microsoft is around $220 billion.   
  
While these figures are interesting to observe, they don't mean much unless you're a stockholder. Apple's market cap is likely to reach $4 trillion in 2024 if its pace doesn't slow down, and with Apple Vision Pro on the horizon, anything is possible

2023-12-08 00:55:11,Apple,AAPL,Will this Backtest work in the real world?,"
I was recently inspired by Charlie Munger and decided to use his philosophy of inversion to build a back test. The question I asked myself is what makes a bad investment? To that I answered:


* They take on a lot of debt which adds risk to the company if things go wrong.
* They give away the company to employees or in acquisitions diluting existing owners.
* They don’t grow
* Earnings don’t arrive in cash
* They have a business model that can easily be recreated
* They sell at a high price

  
To make a good company I reasoned I want to invert the bad company metrics. To model these factors I back tested through Portfolio 123 by ranking the following data:
 
* They take on a lot of debt which adds risk to the company if things go wrong.
   * Low Debt to Assets: Reviewed Quarterly
   * High Interest Coverage: implies debt load can be covered by earnings
* They give away the company to employees or in acquisitions diluting existing owners.
   * Low Equity Dilution: Kinda obvious
* They don’t grow
   * High Sales Per Share Growth
* Earnings don’t arrive in cash
   * High Free Cash Flow per Share Growth
   * High Operating Cash Flow Growth per Share: Companies showing an upward trend in cash flow growth are preferred, as this signals ongoing operational success and growth, avoiding those that have become static.
* They have a business model that can easily be recreated
   * High Average Gross Margins: High gross margins suggest a company can add a lot of value to the raw materials or by the info they have. Economic theory would suggest if others could do the same, the price charged would not be that much higher than the inputs.
* They sell at a high price
   * High Yield of Gross Profit to Market Cap: Going down an income statement or cash flow has messier and messier financials. Focusing on the top level should give a cleaner Yield and I believe would allow for better valuation of earlier stage companies.


  
Here were the results:

* The back test tab selects the higher ranked securities and market cap weights them subject to a 6% max weight and owns 100 stocks at a time from the Russell 1000 index.
* The Ranking Score Tab shows an equal weighted average annualized return.

 
Portfolio123 adjusted for look ahead bias and delisted securities and all that.
  
The big question of course is, does anyone think this will work in the real world? To me it’s a very intuitive strategy and has promise. I would like to hear your thoughts and in particular connect why my assumptions of what a bad company and good company is could be wrong.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Maybe they bought AAPL at $190 and NVDA at $500, adding fuel to the rally.

They must know they are paying too much.

those of you who are familiar with how money managers behave, what do you think is their exit plan after buying this high?

2023-11-20 17:13:05,Apple,AAPL,Bought my first individual stock today.,"I bought MSFT around 10:30am, which I plan to hold for a long time.   It's already gone up 1%, not that it won't go down again.  It will be fun to watch.

I hope this kind of post is okay.  I'm just excited.

(Up until today its all been in managed accounts.  This was an impulse buy driven by my personal interest (AI), so I hope this wasn't too irrational of a purchase.  Technically I had some MSFT in my managed account, but this was the first time I bought on my own, separately.  I'm usually too much of a chicken to buy stocks.  This is less than 1% of my total.)

----

UPDATE: Since I'm getting some salty and sarcastic comments, I'll explain my thinking, although it'll likely attract more saltiness:

I'm gambling Microsoft will become the leader in AI given what's happened in the last 24 hours. OpenAI's loss of staff (up to 70%!) and leadership will cause it to go into permanent stagnation and lose its lead (unless they pull off some miracle this week).

 MSFT is perfectly positioned to take over OpenAI's near monopoly on consumer AI in less than a year. They already know how to operate OpenAI's hardware infrastructure and have poached many of OpenAI's employees and leadership.

AI is the ""next big thing"", as big as the PC, the Internet, or the iPhone, and AGI, in whenever year it comes, will be even bigger.  AI hasn't fully saturated all domains, yet, so the full impact hasn't been felt by most people or industries... yet.

People are commenting, ""but it's at ATH"", which is true.  AAPL was at an all time high in late 2006 (if I have the timing right), and then the iPhone happened.

And all that said, this is 1% of my portfolio.  Calm down.  This was for fun.  I was hoping this would be a friendly community.

edit: removed how many shares I bought as it bothered some people.",55,135,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/17ztgcw/bought_my_first_individual_stock_today/

But is anyone else scared to keep adding to them while they’re hitting ATH’s during an economic tightening (QT) phase? Rates are around 5.5%, yet these stocks keep hitting ATH’s. I don’t expect them to crash or anything, but hitting new highs just doesn’t feel right to me lol.

2023-11-16 10:38:24,Apple,AAPL,"""Magnificent 7"" vs S&P 500?","I really don't like the *""Magnificent 7""* name at all, but since everyone has adopted it, let's just roll with it. For those who don't know the Magnificent 7 are: **AAPL, GOOG, MSFT, AMZN, META, TSLA, NVDA.** With a combined market cap of **more than $11 trillion**, they currently make up approx. **29% of the S&P 500's market cap.** 

The 7 giants have gained **71%** so far this year while the rest of the 493 stocks included in the benchmark index have gained 6%. They have also outperformed all other stocks in terms of growth, profit margins and forward EPS growth, and have stronger balance sheets. 

Most analysts expect that the M7 will continue to outperform all other companies until 2025 at least. 

Now I know this is a ""stocks"" subreddit but just like the majority of retail investors, a large chunk of my portfolio is alocated to an S&P 500 ETF.

So I am actually considering instead of DCAing into a broad index ETF, why don't I just DCA into those 7? Maybe even swap META & TSLA since I am not rly a big fan of, with other 2-3 large caps that I favor, like AMD, and ADBE.

Should we expect these 7 to continue outperforming the rest of the world? Should we consider cyclicality? There's no doubt that all 7 of these companies are leaders and are probably not going anywhere in the near future. Nowdays it's as difficult as ever to overtake these giants, imo.",517,331,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/17wju7x/magnificent_7_vs_sp_500/
