2025-04-29 04:07:40,Meta,META,What should I be looking at in the upcoming META earning call?,"For Meta Platforms (META), the upcoming earnings call (scheduled for April 30, after market close) is highly anticipated, especially with big tech volatility and renewed focus on AI, advertising, and cost control. Here are the most important things to watch and key questions the market will focus on:

# 1. Advertising Revenue & AI Initiatives

* **Core Focus:** Analysts expect AI-driven improvements in ad targeting and engagement to drive modest revenue and EPS beats, with estimates at $41.36 billion in revenue and $5.21 EPS.
* **Watch for:**
   * Specific numbers and commentary on AI’s impact on ad efficiency and pricing.
   * Competitive positioning versus other social platforms and Google.
   * How AI tools are translating into measurable monetization gains.

# 2. Cost Controls & Margins

* **Key Metrics:** Operating margin, net margin, and cash flow are in focus as META’s cost discipline has been a major driver of stock gains recently.
* **Watch for:**
   * Updated cost guidance, especially R&D and infrastructure spend for AI.
   * Is cost discipline sustainable, or is spending ramping up again (especially for Reality Labs and AI infrastructure)?

# 3. Reality Labs / Metaverse Segment

* **Trends Analysis:** There’s been a major spike in public interest in Reality Labs in the last few months, likely tied to new product launches or AI innovations.
* **Watch for:**
   * Progress on AR/VR devices, user engagement metrics, and revenue/cost breakdowns.
   * Management’s view on the timeline for profitability in Reality Labs.

# 4. Regulatory Risks & Shareholder Proposals

* **News Focus:** Ongoing regulatory scrutiny (antitrust, privacy, content) and a notable shareholder proposal addressing online antisemitism and hate speech risks.
* **Watch for:**
   * Management’s commentary on legal and regulatory headwinds.
   * Updates on how META is addressing shareholder concerns regarding platform safety and governance.

# 5. AI Spending & Geopolitical Headwinds

* **News Focus:** Investor concerns about Meta’s AI capex amid tariff and trade policy uncertainty (especially with recent political headlines).
* **Watch for:**
   * Any adjustments to AI/data center spending plans.
   * Management’s assessment of tariff/trade impacts on supply chain and costs.

# 6. Valuation & Guidance

* **Current Valuation:** META’s trailing P/E is \~22.3, with strong growth (EPS up 62% YoY, revenue up 22% YoY) but recent stock price pullback (down \~28% from peak).
* **Watch for:**
   * Updated guidance for Q2 and full-year—are growth and margin targets intact?
   * Commentary on buybacks or potential capital returns (dividends, repurchases).

# What Analysts & the Market Want to Hear

* Evidence that AI is not just a buzzword but is materially driving revenue and efficiency.
* Confidence that META can navigate regulatory and cost challenges without derailing growth.
* A roadmap for profitability or meaningful traction from Reality Labs.
* Clarity on spending discipline and capital allocation priorities.

# Trends & Sentiment

* Public and market interest in Reality Labs is surging, while the core Family of Apps sees steady but less dramatic attention—pointing to high expectations for innovation and new product cycles.
* Sentiment remains cautiously optimistic but sensitive to any negative surprises, especially on costs or regulatory issues.

**Action Item:** Listen for specifics on AI monetization, cost outlook, regulatory strategy, and Reality Labs progress. Management’s tone and detail on these fronts will likely drive META’s post-earnings price action.",0,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kaf5pp/what_should_i_be_looking_at_in_the_upcoming_meta/
2025-04-28 22:32:06,Meta,META,"Stock market today: Dow, S&P 500 erase slide to rise for 5th straight day in lead up to Big Tech earnings","Stocks closed mixed on Monday but recovered from sharp losses to begin a big week of heavyweight earnings reports and macroeconomic data that will continue to paint an early picture of the US economy's response to President Trump's tariffs.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) erased losses of as much as 1% to rise just above the flatline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) edged up 0.3%, notching its longest win streak of 2025. Both indexes ended in positive territory for the fifth straight day.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell below the flatline, as shares of Big Tech recovered from steep early-session losses.

Wall Street is coming off a rebounding run last week. The gains came as Trump eased pressure on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, and hinted at light at the end of the tunnel for sky-high 145% tariffs on China. On Monday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said it was ""up to China"" to deescalate the trade battle, though he suggested its recent moves to exempt certain US goods from duties represented a positive step.

Earnings are the highlight of the week ahead, with 180 S&P 500 companies expected to report quarterly financial results. Big Tech leads the way, as Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) are all due in the coming days, alongside Coca-Cola (KO), Eli Lilly (LLY), and Chevron (CVX).

Broader economic news will flavor the coming days, as investors eye Wednesday's release of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumer Expenditures (PCE) index, to see the impact of tariffs on the general public's ""core"" expenses. An initial reading on first quarter US GDP is also due Wednesday.

The April jobs report is also in sight, as the labor market has so far remained resistant to signs of economic slowdown.

Broader economic news will flavor the coming days, as investors eye Wednesday's release of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumer Expenditures (PCE) index, to see the impact of tariffs on the general public's ""core"" expenses.

The April jobs report is also in sight, as the labor market has remained resistant to signs of economic slowdown. Economists expect the US economy added 133,000 nonfarm payroll jobs last month, with the unemployment rate remaining at 4.2%.

The most critical reading may be the non-farm payrolls report on Friday, as the market expects an addition of about 125K jobs.

The goldilocks read may be around 100-150K jobs. We don't want a number that is too strong, as it would likely decrease the probabilities for future rate cuts. At the same time, we don't want a number that is perceived as too weak, as it would imply that the economy may be worsening more rapidly than anticipated, raising recession and other concerns.

2025-04-28 12:47:42,Meta,META,"Stock futures drift lower as traders await Big Tech earnings, progress on trade deals","Stock futures fell Monday ahead of a packed week for earnings and economic data. Wall Street is also awaiting any progress on trade deal negotiations.

S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures each declined 0.2%, while futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 56 points, or 0.1%.

On Monday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent offered little clarity on the direction of reaching a possible trade agreement with China, but said that the onus was not on the United States.

""I believe that it's up to China to de-escalate, because they sell five times more to us than we sell to them, and so these 120%, 145% tariffs are unsustainable,"" Bessent said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""

His comments come after President Donald Trump said last week that discussions with China were underway, refuting China's claims of no trade talks between the two countries.

On the positive side, however, Bessent said that they were making progress on other trade proposals, suggesting one with India would be ""one of the first"" to come. South Korea also hinted last week that trade talks were underway.

Investors are looking ahead to the busiest period of the first-quarter earnings season, which will see more than 180 S&P 500 companies report results. Four of the 'Magnificent Seven' companies— Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms and Microsoft — will release their quarterly reports, as will financial, staples and health care stocks Visa, Coca-Cola, and Eli Lilly.

Earnings results have been somewhat strong for the prior quarter, with 73% of companies reporting beating analysts' estimates so far — slightly below the 5-year average of 77%, according to FactSet data. Still, Wall Street is lowering expectations for the second quarter and the full year as companies come out with uncertain guidance because of President Donald Trump's tariffs.

This week will mark the end of April, which has seen stocks whipsaw across a wide trading range after Trump unveiled his sweeping tariff plans and then later walked some of the stiffer duties back.

So far in April, the S&P 500 is down by 1.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is on track to lose 4.5% and the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.5%. The S&P 500 briefly entered a bear market on April 7 and has made a recovery since, but the index has failed to break through key resistance levels.

""While it may be too early to make the technical case for a bottom in beta underperformance, the recent rebound off key support implies investors should remain on high alert for a potential shift back toward risk-on leadership,"" Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for LPL Financial, said.

The week also will see multiple reports on the labor market as well as key data on inflation and economic growth. Topping the list will be Friday's nonfarm payrolls release, while first-quarter gross domestic product and the Fed's preferred inflation gauge will be out Wednesday.

2025-04-27 15:52:41,Meta,META,Big Tech’s Earnings Problem Is Estimates May Be Way Too High,">The last time Big Tech delivered earnings, Donald Trump had just started his term, stocks were soaring on expectations of a pro-growth government agenda and investors’ main worry was how long it would take companies to convert their artificial intelligence spending into profits.

>Three months later, they are facing a far bleaker picture.

>This week’s quarterly results from Microsoft Corp., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc will land in a market obsessed with every twist of a trade war that’s wiped $5.5 trillion from the S&P 500 Index. AI concerns have taken a back seat to angst over the possibility of a tariff-induced recession, while safe havens like gold have become the trade de jour for investors too rattled to buy stocks on the cheap.

>Even with all the uncertainty, Wall Street isn’t giving the companies’ estimates much wiggle room. Analysts expect the so-called Magnificent Seven — which also includes Google-parent Alphabet, Tesla Inc. and Nvidia Corp. — to deliver an average of 15% profit growth in 2025, a forecast that’s barely budged since the start of March despite the flareup in trade tensions.

>That raises the stakes for the four megacaps reporting this week, which collectively have a nearly 20% weighting in the S&P 500. Traders are unlikely to forgive earnings shortfalls in an already fearful market climate, despite steep declines in the stocks’ share prices and improved valuations. Dire outlooks from the industry behemoths would also be poorly received, especially if they bolster fears of muted corporate spending ahead.

>“Any modicum of a weaker than expected number is going to cause a further selloff because of the concern around tariffs,” said Phil Blancato, chief market strategist at Osaic Wealth, who believes this year’s weakness in megacaps is a buying opportunity.

>Markets got an early read on how Big Tech might be faring last week. Tesla reported its worst quarter in years, though traders cheered signs that chief executive Elon Musk intends to step away from his government work and focus more on the electric-vehicle maker. Alphabet beat expectations but offered little future guidance. The Bloomberg Magnificent 7 index jumped 9.1% last week amid a broader market rebound, though it’s still down 15% in 2025.

>A deeper look comes during a two-day stretch that starts with results from Meta and Microsoft on Wednesday. While many executives have declined to predict how tariffs might impact their bottom lines, Wall Street has been doing its own math. Based on a 22% tariff rate modeled by Bloomberg Economics, lower gross margins could result in a net income contraction of about 7% in 2025 for the S&P 500, compared with the current consensus estimate of nearly 12% growth, wrote Bloomberg Intelligence chief equity strategist Gina Martin Adams.

>Another key area of focus will be spending: The four biggest spenders — Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta — are projected to pour roughly $300 billion into capital expenditures in their current fiscal years. While the companies have pledged to maintain that pace in 2025, Microsoft’s sudden decision to pause work on some data centers suggests cloud computing providers may be re-evaluating expenditures.

>Apple, one of the companies most exposed to tariffs due to its supply chain reliance on China, may benefit from a pull-forward in demand from consumers seeking to avoid higher prices. However, those sales are seen as a one-off benefit, with tariffs sapping demand in future quarters. Amazon faces tariff risks to its e-commerce and advertising businesses, though a hit to profits could be cushioned by earnings in its high-margin web services unit, according to Jefferies analyst Brent Thill.

>That said, there’s little expectation that executives will be able to give estimates with any degree of confidence, given the high level of macroeconomic uncertainty. American Airlines Group Inc. and Skechers USA Inc. are among companies that have abandoned forecasts this quarter.

>Michael Shaoul, founder of the ION Macro Fund, said it will be difficult for executives to convince the market that they have a true view into financial performance in coming quarters.

>“I think the more experienced management aren’t even going to try,” he said.

>A bullish argument, of course, is that tech giants’ dominant industry positions and robust balance sheets make them better suited to withstand an economic downturn than other companies — even if the earnings picture is cloudy. The Magnificent Seven are also less richly valued following the recent selloff: Alphabet, for example, trades at 17 times profits estimated over the next 12 months, compared with an average over the past decade of 21 times, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

>That could boost the appeal of the Magnificent Seven to dip-buyers, especially if signs of easing in the global trade war emerge. A flash of that came last week, when stocks soared after Trump said a deal with Beijing would significantly reduce the tariffs he’s posted on Chinese goods.

>But for Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer and chief market strategist at Truist Advisory Services, it all comes down to the denominator in the price-to-earnings ratio.

>“The valuations are getting more interesting down here, but we haven’t pulled the trigger yet,” he said. “There are a lot of questions on the E-side of the equation.”

2025-04-25 13:55:58,Meta,META,Magnificent Seven,"For those who own Mag 7 stocks in their portfolio, out of curiosity, which ones do you own and why?

In my opinion, besides Tesla, the remaining 6 are exceptional businesses and are all worth owning. However, you wouldn’t want your portfolio to be too overweight in them either, in my opinion.

Not to mention with the recent market uncertainty, some great buying opportunities have opened up in these stocks. Besides Tesla which in my view is still overvalued as hell.

I’ll start - I own Amazon, Meta and Google because I feel like I’m able to determine their intrinsic value appropriately.

Skip on Apple because I’m concerned about a lack of innovation and slowing earnings growth.

Skip on NVIDIA because I don’t understand the product enough to determine whether or not it has long term value creation.

Skip on Tesla for aforementioned reasons.

Skip on Microsoft due to stagnation in earnings.


So; which ones do you own and why?

No judgement if you own all 7 either 😆

2025-04-24 19:41:47,Meta,META,Meta is laying off employees in Reality Labs,"Meta has laid off an unspecified number of employees in its Reality Labs division, a company spokesperson confirmed.

The cuts affected teams working in Oculus Studios, Meta’s in-house games division for Quest headsets, as well as some employees involved in the company’s hardware efforts, according to people familiar with the matter. Specific titles impacted by the layoffs include Supernatural, the VR fitness game that Meta acquired for over $400 million and successfully defended from a government antitrust lawsuit attempting to block the sale. A note on the official Supernatural Facebook group states that “these changes are meant to help us work more efficiently on what the future of fitness could be.”

“Some teams within Oculus Studios are undergoing shifts in structure and roles that have impacted team size,” Meta spokesperson Tracy Clayton said in a statement. “These changes are meant to help Studios work more efficiently on future mixed reality experiences for our growing audience, while still delivering great content for people today. We remain committed to investing in mixed reality experiences, including fitness and games, and our drive to deliver the best experiences possible for the Quest and Supernatural communities remains unchanged.” He declined to comment on the cuts outside of Oculus Studios.

While sales of Meta’s smart glasses with Ray-Ban have grown faster than the company expected, Quest sales have continued to struggle. The latest Quest 3S, which Meta released last fall, is currently on sale for roughly 10 percent off in some configurations.

I see frequently people post portfolio of SP500 + some individual stock, but that stock is Apple or NVDA. So the question is why would you hold Apple (and similar) and SP500? You are already over exposed to Apple by buying SP500, so why add to the concentration?

2025-04-24 01:06:57,Meta,META,"IBM beats Revenue & EPS, Outlook decent, stock down 6% AH over cancelled government consulting contracts overshadowing results","Link to the recap: [https://happybull.net/2025/04/23/ibm-ibm-software-shines-and-z17-looms-as-big-blue-navigates-shifting-tides/](https://happybull.net/2025/04/23/ibm-ibm-software-shines-and-z17-looms-as-big-blue-navigates-shifting-tides/)

Key Notes:

* During the Q1 2025 earnings call, management painted a picture of a company reaping the benefits of its strategic pivot towards hybrid cloud and AI. However, the initial after-hours stock reaction was notably negative, with shares dropping over 6%. News that several government consulting contracts were shelved appeared to overshadow the otherwise solid results and upbeat forecast, suggesting investors are weighing near-term headwinds—particularly in consulting and perhaps the pace of Red Hat’s growth—against longer-term catalysts like the upcoming z17 mainframe launch. Despite the market’s skepticism, the narrative from management focused on confident execution, leaning heavily on software momentum.
* The clear standout in the quarter was IBM’s Software segment, posting a solid 9% constant currency growth. This performance underscores the ongoing shift in IBM’s revenue mix towards higher-growth, recurring revenue streams. CFO James Kavanaugh, during the call, emphasized this point, noting that software now constitutes about 45% of IBM’s business, with roughly 80% of that being recurring. Strength was broad-based, with Automation up 15%, Data & AI climbing 7%, and Red Hat growing 13%.
* CEO Arvind Krishna revealed during the Q1 call that IBM’s generative AI book of business has swelled to over $6 billion since inception, adding over $1 billion in Q1 alone. Interestingly, about four-fifths of this is tied to Consulting engagements, helping clients strategize and deploy AI, with the remaining fifth coming from Software, including platforms like watsonx. Recent news reinforces this push, with IBM showcasing watsonx-powered features at events like the Masters Tournament, integrating Meta’s Llama 4 models into [watsonx.ai](http://watsonx.ai), and expanding collaborations with partners like NVIDIA.
* IBM Consulting delivered a flat year-over-year revenue performance in Q1, which marked a sequential improvement but appeared to be a key point of concern for investors, contributing significantly to the after-hours stock decline. 
* The Infrastructure segment saw a 4% revenue decline in Q1, largely anticipated as IBM wrapped up the final quarter of its successful z16 mainframe cycle. The z16 program itself was highlighted on the call as the most successful in IBM’s history.
* Despite the macro crosscurrents and a skeptical initial market reaction fueled by the consulting contract news, IBM confidently reiterated its full-year guidance. The company targets revenue growth of 5%-plus at constant currency and free cash flow of approximately $13.5 billion. In a move explicitly aimed at bolstering investor confidence and providing clarity amidst the market uncertainty, IBM broke from its usual practice and issued specific Q2 revenue guidance. As Kavanaugh explained, “We’ve chosen now, in light of the very unprecedented dynamic of uncertainty going on in the market, to give a second-quarter revenue guidance range… We felt incumbent upon ourselves to give as much transparency as possible.”",47,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1k6fopv/ibm_beats_revenue_eps_outlook_decent_stock_down_6/

2025-04-23 15:38:06,Meta,META,"Change my mind: Holding cash is foolish, you should be DCAing","I can't believe I need to be saying this, but the discussions here in this subreddit has led me to believe I am being gaslit, people here are young investors with no notion of being long-term investors, or maybe I'm the  fool that's only been in the market for 8 years so I'm the guy who has no idea what I'm talking about. If it's the latter of the three, feel free to correct me.

For the past weeks I have seen so many people saying they are holding cash because they point out it's plainly and clearly obvious that in the coming months tariffs will finally take effect and that's when the true hurt will begin. The stock market is still overpriced. The V shape recovery after a crash is a lie this time! A true recession is where stocks will be down for years. Europe hasn't even retaliated yet. The true people who are 20+ aged investors and lived through 2008 know it's time to hold cash and wait. Even Warren Buffet is holding cash!

All pure speculation in my view. If I asked you right now what Trump's next move is, what Xi Jinping's next move it, if there will be a trade deal between USA and China, if Trump is backing down now due to advisors, can you answer any of these with certainty? Can you also tell me that when GOOG, NVDA, UBER, META, AMZN, XOM, etc all report earnings they will tank rather than go up and bring the markets up? Where exactly is the market bottom?

Just stop. Just like how today I can't tell you we are going back to a bull market with reaching ATH by the end of the year because we just had two massive days of rallies and Trump saying he is going to be soft on China with reports that his advisors were shitting the bed about the economy, you equally can't call the opposite about bull traps or whatever. What I can tell you is that you just missed a bunch of blue-chip stocks that were trading for one of their most undervalued prices ever. You should have been buying a week ago, you should be buying now, you should be DCAing stocks you have conviction in until they reach a price you believe is overvalued and you find a better opportunity in another. 

If you are an investor and stock holder, you are in this for the long-run. You are in this 10+ years. Even if your recession thesis plays out the market will recover. If you on the other hand are looking for a short-term, 10x my money in 2-3 years and retire, you're in the wrong place.

The research note said that Chinese companies paid Meta/Facebook $18 billion in 2024 for ad revenue, which was 11% of Meta's total ad-revenue.

The note mentions that Beijing can instruct companies that are heavy spenders like Temu and Shein to pause ad spend with the American ad company, potentially costing Zuckerberg's ad giant up to $7 billion this year. I guess this is similar to telling the airlines to not accept Boeing planes anymore?  
I wonder if Google will also experience ad-cuts?

Apple (AAPL.O), was fined 500 million euros ($570 million) on Wednesday and Meta (META.O), 200 million euros, as European Union antitrust regulators handed out the first sanctions under landmark legislation aimed at curbing the power of Big Tech.

The EU fines could stoke tensions with U.S President Donald Trump who has threatened to levy tariffs against countries that penalise U.S. companies.

2025-04-19 15:25:48,Meta,META,The era of American stock market exceptionalism is over,"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/investing/american-exceptionalism-over/?ICID=continue_without_subscribing_reg_first

Nearly three quarters of fund managers think that US exceptionalism has peaked. The prevailing trend of the last decade – a belief in the continued success of US markets far beyond that of other regions – is over, according to the Bank of America’s latest survey.
Over the past two months, fund managers have dumped US equities at a record pace as President Trump’s tariff war and uncertainty over global economic stability continue. For those watching closely, it should not come as a shock, although it has happened perhaps a little faster than anticipated.

While it has come to feel like business as usual, US exceptionalism isn’t the historic status quo. In the 1980s, for example, the rapid rise of Japanese stocks challenged the US dominance of global markets.
Tom Stevenson, investment director at Fidelity Personal Investing, explains that ultimately, the stock market bubble was over-inflated and had a long way to fall – a scenario today’s US market is particularly vulnerable to.
One of the most notable pinpricks came at the start of this year with the release of DeepSeek, a sophisticated AI tool developed in China. The extremely cheap development cost of the model has sparked concerns that the AI moat of the American tech giants may not be as wide as had been assumed.

Since 2012, average earnings from US stocks have risen 145pc – over the same period, European and UK markets have each seen earnings increase by just 37pc and 30pc, respectively.

Hugh Gimber, global market strategist at JP Morgan, says: “Technology has been the leading sector globally and the US has been overweight in that sector. In an environment where technology [stocks] have been standout it has been hard for other regions to out perform.”
However, the performance gap between the Magnificent Seven (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Tesla, Meta and Nvidia) and the rest of the S&P 500 has narrowed of late. A year ago, the tech giants were outgrowing the rest of the US market by 30pc, a figure that has plummeted to just 6pc. That is expected to halve to just 3pc in 2026.

The upset is apparent in other metrics, too. While the Magnificent Seven accounted for 50pc of the S&P 500’s earnings in 2024, this share is projected to fall to a third for 2025.

All of this adds up to a simple fact: US equities are unlikely to outperform the rest of the world to the extent that they have done in the recent past.
In fact, Mr Stevenson warns they may underperform.
Markets are also becoming suspicious of US government debt, which could have dramatic consequences for the stock market.
Mr Gimber explains: “One of the big parts behind the US economic outperformance is the size of the government deficit that has been running.
“This has been an expansion built on US government debt, and although levels are still rising the market is getting wary of US government debt, especially in the context of inflationary pressure from tariffs.”

What I'm wondering is what will happen in the next months. I assume their revenue growth might slow a bit, but not substantially, at least in the Q1 and Q2 earning reports. Therefore I can hardly understand why the tech and semi companies are falling even harder than the overall market. 

Additionally, the trend is towards more digitalisation, automation, and AI usage, which should all speak for rather more need for such companies, and not less. 

I'm of course aware that the WH is currently an attention seeking drama queen. And that the dot com bubble bursted even though the internet is insanely useful.

[Gold](https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/investing/article/gold-price-today-wednesday-april-16-2025-gold-opens-with-new-high-134956304.html) has surpassed the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks as the most crowded trade on Wall Street as the precious metal surged to record highs this year amid volatile markets and an uncertain economic backdrop.

According to the latest Bank of America fund managers survey published this week, nearly half of the fund managers surveyed (49%) see long gold, or bets that gold prices will rise, as the most crowded trade in the market right now. This marks the first time in two years that fund managers did not see the Magnificent Seven as Wall Street's most crowded trade, according to the survey.

Gold futures ([GC=F](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GC=F/)) on Wednesday rose to an all-time high of $3,334 as investors continued to [favor the safe-haven asset](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-notches-best-week-since-2020-amid-shaken-investor-confidence-in-us-201546983.html) amid a falling US dollar ([DX-Y.NYB](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/DX-Y.NYB/__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!HIhgXKgPRojUSTTqYlaKSTMqCnabU-_BFJYcQNg1l9bJcllZ1Gp3LtN-1O0pcbknpYvKz0DBczt7-zHHf99GDzXJ1VfxDc7wuw$)) and tariff uncertainty.

Gold prices have surged more than 27% year to date, while the Magnificent Seven tech stocks — Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)), Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL), [GOOG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG)), Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)), Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)), Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)), Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)), and Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) — are down considerably.

Tesla stock has led Magnificent Seven losses and is down about 38% since the start of 2025. Apple stock has fallen 21%.

Nvidia stock has also declined 21% year to date. On Wednesday,[ the AI chip giant warned of a multibillion-dollar ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-dives-as-chipmaker-sees-55-billion-hit-from-surprise-china-chip-controls-130319576.html)impact from US export controls on China, which weighed on shares.

Shares of Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon — the remainder of the Magnificent Seven — are all down by double-digit percentages since the start of the year.

Gold's rally comes as [central banks' demand hit all-time highs](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-demand-hits-record-levels-as-central-banks-buy-at-eye-watering-pace-205945413.html) last year and as investors increased inflows into physical gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

""The new highs in gold are signaling a shift in appetite for US assets,"" Ryan McIntyre, senior managing partner at asset manager firm Sprott, recently told Yahoo Finance.

""Confidence in the US has clearly been shaken, so people are looking to diversify.""

Wall Street analysts have remained bullish on gold, [upping their price forecasts ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-keeps-upping-its-bullish-calls-on-gold--heres-why-162732492.html)on the precious metal even amid its fast ascent.

Some 42% of fund managers expect gold will be the best-performing asset of 2025, up from 23% in March, according to Bank of America.

[**NVDA (Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\- Nvidia announced it expects a $5.5B charge in Q1 2026 due to new U.S. export restrictions on its H20 AI chips to China. These chips were lobotomized versions initially designed to comply with earlier export controls but are now subject to stricter licensing requirements under the Trump administration's policies. I'm mainly interested if NVDA breaks $100 to the downside. The semis industry is volatile due to escalating U.S.-China trade tensions, affecting AMD and INTC (not as much) as well. Export policy volatility regarding semis exports will likely be in flux rather than having some kind of set policy and affect global AI chip demand. He who controls the spice controls the universe!!!!

[**IBKR (Interactive Brokers)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=IBKR&p=d)\- Reported Q1 adjusted EPS of $1.88 vs $1.92 expected. Revenue of $1.43B vs $1.42B expected. Despite the earnings miss, they announced a 28% dividend increase and a 4-for-1 stock split effective mid-July. Most of these brokerages have been selling off from the market peak around mid Feb, but I don't consider these to be interesting at the moment for outperformance, unless they fall further. Risks to watch out for in these include decreasing retail trading activity, fee compression, and competition from zero-commission platforms. (Also worth noting HOOD also fell from the Feb market peak)

[**META (Meta)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=META&p=d)\- Zuck testified in an FTC antitrust trial about Meta's acquisition of Instagram, with internal emails suggesting shady motives. The FTC alleges the moves were to neutralize competition and monopolize the social media space. We've had a significant selloff for the past 2 months from 750 to 500, and while not extremely liquid due to price/volume, it's still worth pursuing if there is some catalyst for a forced sale of Instagram (unlikely). Risks include potential breakup rulings (this is the white whale trade), broader regulatory clampdowns, and increased oversight of tech M&A (we've seen less M&A already this year in the Trump admin mainly due to volatility).

[**ASML (Advanced Semiconductor Materials Lithography)-**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASML&p=d)  Reported Q1 net sales of €7.74B vs €7.8B expected, and net profit of €2.36B vs €2.3B expected. **Net bookings came in at €3.94B vs €4.89B expected, well below forecasts.** CEO flagged tariff-related uncertainty as a key risk to forward demand. Order shortfall is a bad sign (and also an explanation for why the rest of the semis fell as well). I typically don't trade super high priced stocks like this due to the spread but ultimately interested if we fall further to last week's levels (\~$600).",21,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1k0k38d/0416_interesting_stocks_today_he_who_controls_the/

# Key Takeaways

* Netflix shares jumped Tuesday after a report company executives laid out ambitious targets at a business review meeting last month.
* The streaming giant aims to double its revenue by 2030 and reach a market capitalization of $1 trillion, *The* *Wall Street Journal* reported Monday.
* Netflix is set to report first-quarter results after the market closes Thursday.

Netflix (NLFX) shares jumped Tuesday following a report company executives laid out ambitious targets at a business review meeting last month.

Executives said the streaming giant aims to double the $39 billion in revenue Netflix brought in last year, with a global ad sales target of $9 billion by 2030, *The* *Wall Street Journal* reported Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The streaming giant also aims to reach a [market capitalization](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp) of $1 trillion by 2030, the report said, up from roughly $419.2 billion. The only U.S. companies with a market cap above $1 trillion today include Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B).

Netflix did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Shares were up more than 5% in recent trading Tuesday, leading gains on the S&P 500. They've added about 60% of their value over the past 12 months. (Read *Investopedia's* live coverage of [today's market action here](https://www.investopedia.com/dow-jones-today-04152025-11715325).)

The streaming giant has shown ""momentum” in its core subscription business, the analysts said. That momentum lowers the company’s overall risk, the bank added, even if the advertising market struggles amid rising trade tensions.

>According to Wynn-Williams, the company now known as Meta worked directly with the Chinese Community Party (CCP) to “undermine U.S. national security and betray American values,” she said.

>She alleges that Facebook created custom-built censorship tools for the CCP, which gave a “chief editor” extensive power over content moderation to the point that they could choose to shut off service completely in certain regions of China or on certain dates, like the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre.

>Meta denied Wynn-Williams’ allegations.

>“Sarah Wynn-Williams’ testimony is divorced from reality and riddled with false claims,” said Ryan Daniels, a Meta spokesperson, in a statement to TechCrunch. “While Mark Zuckerberg himself was public about our interest in offering our services in China and details were widely reported beginning over a decade ago, the fact is this: we do not operate our services in China today.”

>Wynn-Williams’ testimony was highly anticipated. In March, she published a book about her time at Facebook called “Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed, and Lost Idealism.”

>The day after the book was published, Meta won an interim decision from an arbitrator, which said that Wynn-Williams violated a non-disparagement clause that she signed when she left the company. But Meta’s desire to limit the book’s reach seems to have had the opposite effect — now, the book is No. 2 on The New York Times Best Sellers list under non-fiction.

>Meta told TechCrunch that the arbitration order does not prohibit her from speaking to Congress and that the company does not intend to interfere with her legal rights. The company also said it’s not a secret that it does business in China.

>Toward the end of Wynn-Williams’ tenure in 2017, Facebook had launched a photo-sharing app called Colorful Balloons in China, as well as an app called Moments. Meta points out that this has been [previously reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/11/technology/facebook-china-moments-colorful-balloons.html) and that it discloses in government filings that it generates advertising revenue from China, even though its services like Facebook and Instagram are banned there.

>Per Meta’s own 10-K [filing](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001326801/a8eb8302-b52c-4db5-964f-a2d796c05f4b.pdf), it made $18.3 billion in revenue for 2024, up from $13.69 billion and $7.4 billion in 2023 and 2022, respectively.

>Wynn-Williams claims that Meta’s relationship with the Chinese government runs deeper, though.

>She shared documents with Congress, and Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) showed some redacted versions of these documents in the hearing.

>In one email, it appeared that Facebook executives had discussed granting the CCP access to user data from China and Hong Kong.

>“Facebook appears to have been willing to provide the data of users in Hong Kong to the Chinese government at a time when pro-democracy protesters were opposing Beijing’s crackdown,” Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) said, then asked Wynn-Williams if that is true. She said it is.

>“As part of the censorship tool that was developed, there were virality counters — so any time a piece of content got over 10,000 views, that would automatically trigger it being reviewed by what they called the chief editor,” she said. “What was particularly surprising is that the virality counters were not just installed, but activated in Hong Kong and also in Taiwan.”

>Senator Blumenthal pointed out that Zuckerberg had previously denied under oath that Facebook had built censorship tools to enter the Chinese market.

>Wynn-Williams added that if Meta were to share Chinese user data with the Chinese government, from a technological perspective, she doesn’t think there would be a way to avoid sharing user data from Americans who had interacted with Chinese users.

>She also claimed that Meta had briefed China on developments with various technologies like AI and facial recognition.

>“The greatest trick Mark Zuckerberg ever pulled was wrapping the American flag around himself and calling himself a patriot, and saying he didn’t offer services in China, while he spent the last decade building an 18 billion-dollar business there,” Wynn-Williams said before the Senate.

>“And he continues to wrap the flag around himself as we move into the next era of artificial intelligence,” she added.

**Thoughts:** Overall pretty interesting whistleblower news on META and the business it does with China- it's unlikely this will lead to any significant regulatory/government action but considering that tensions with China are high, I think it's important to think about possible data breaches or security issues that other META's users face. This could also affect government contracts/AI expansion in the future they're gunning for.

2025-04-09 20:49:35,Meta,META,I warned everyone tariffs were a negotiating tactic 5 days ago. Nobody listened,"[This was my post verbatim](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/s/S6dzbSZx1I), it was downvoted and criticized to oblivion. Never trust the Reddit mob.


“Tariffs will be negotiated away. Buy as much stocks as possible!

Everyone here is panicking and thinking these tariffs are going to destroy everything. It’s not an incorrect thought… IF they stay in effect for a long period. 

However it’s important to listen to what Trump has said. Trump said he’s open to tarrif cuts if countries offer something phenomenal. He also said now these countries will be coming to us to negotiate rather than the other way around. He used tik tok as an example to say he may cut tarrif on china to close a tik tok deal. 

Trump put these tariffs in effect to give him huge leverage over every country. He even bragged that every country has called him to negotiate. Acting tough like the tariffs will be in place for a few years, is ONLY to increase their leverage. The more difficult it seems to remove tariffs the more negotiating power Trump has. 

This is a rare stock crash where it’s completely self inflicted with the signing of a pen from the president. This means to end this pain will ONLY take the president to end the tariffs- which can be done instantly. 

I am very sure this will be exactly like the Covid crash. He will keep talking a big talk and more and more terrible news will come out. But then there will be cracks as exceptions are made and deals are negotiated. This is literally the man who wrote “Art of the Deal”. He is 100% transactional and is always aiming to make a deal.

Personally I am buying AI stocks like crazy. This is probably the last chance to get on the AI boat before this stuff rockets. SMH, ASML, NVDA, AMZN META—- all these big tech names will come out fine long term. No matter how scary it gets just keep buying. “",0,56,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jvgeuy/i_warned_everyone_tariffs_were_a_negotiating/

I have about 1-2k that I could invest which yeah people might laugh at that cause maybe its not a lot but its just what I have and what I can do, and I would be ok with investing it knowing that the stocks potentially go even lower, knowing eventually it will hopefully recover but I figure might as well do it now instead of waiting trying to time the market and losing out on the ""sale"". I figure I could buy a bit of Apple, NVidia, Meta, Google stuff like that that's generally pretty safe but is on sale, am I right about that, or the S&P500.

So a couple questions I have:

1. What platform or app should I use to buy stocks, is robinhood good? Some of my friends use it, if not what to use

2. Lets say I have 2k to invest should I do it separately over 2 weeks, or over 2 months, or $500 a week, or all at once?

3. Is there any measure I need to take when buying a stock, do I just buy it and its there in the platform until the day I take it out?

4. Best things to invest in, or from your experiance best thing to invest in? As I mentioned above those are kind of the stocks I figure id try and get a couple of

5. Any other general advice you can give id appreciate, again not trying to do to much or go all in on stocks but I figured again I have some extra money id rather invest while the market is down then just have it be sitting doing nothing

2025-04-07 02:59:54,Meta,META,Lets speak about inflation S&P 500 points and how all this is gonna play for the small investor,"So basically, I'm crunching numbers tonight to figure out my approach for the coming months.

The S&P 500 closed at 4,766 points on December 31, 2021. Today, it's at 5,075—though we could be much lower by tomorrow night. That’s a gain of just 6.46% over 3 years and 97 days.

On the inflation side:

* In 2022, the US inflation rate peaked at 8.00%,
* Then dropped to 4.12% in 2023,
* And further eased to 2.9% in 2024.

**SOFT LANDING**… I honestly miss hearing those two words.

If we compound those three numbers, the average American has lost about **15.7%** of their purchasing power.

So, if you bought the index in the last days of 2021, you’d be roughly **-9%** in real terms today—and probably worse off in the coming weeks or months.

I wouldn’t be surprised to see the index drop to 3,800 or even 3,500. But it simply *can’t* go much lower. The earnings are solid, and inflation has inflated those earnings too. Many companies will maintain their value, especially since a lot of them generate revenue outside the US.

That said, the system will recover. Practically the entire world relies on US companies. Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Google are in homes across the globe—billions of people use them daily for work or socializing. The same goes for manufacturers like CAT, Deere, KO, Pepsi, etc.

We’ll be fine. The system will reset, and eventually, we’ll return to profitability. Again, billions of people depend on a healthy US economy. Capitalism isn’t collapsing anytime soon.

Well, this ended up becoming a little trilogy. The market has went down, a lot, and the big question is: 

Is this time to buy?

I think so. I have been, over Thursday and Friday. 

Why?

1. Because these tariffs are bad. They are so bad that, if unchanged, they will cause not only a recession, but I think there will be riots on the streets within 6 months. 

2. Trump -- and the republican party -- are on a timer. Midterms are next year. They need to show results, not a crashing economy. Republicans are already starting to voice discontent. Ted Cruz *openly* stated this could be a ""political bloodbath"". If tariffs stay on, republicans will break ranks. Anything else is political suicide. 

3. This leads me to conclude that tariffs will be removed. Either via Trump or through congressional action. Maybe even impeachment. The result? Markets moon. 

This leads me to 3 scenarios: 

1. Tariffs end quickly via renegotiation or Trump just backing down. I mean, islands with penguins? Seriously? Trump declares victory.

2. Some tariffs (China) stay, many others are removed. Certain industries benefit, others feel pain.

3. Tariffs stay on long enough to necessitate public/congressional intervention. Political chaos, recession, Maga goose cooked.

In scenario 1 and 2, damage is limited and markets ascend quickly. Remember, most gains come from certain days. 
In scenario 3, damage includes a recession. Earnings go down and valuations may retreat to ~16, which is ~4400 on the S&P. We are at 5070 now.

I'm deploying 80% of cash to buy. Keeping 20% safe, just in case.

So far, I've bought financials (KRE, WAL), tech (INTC, NVDA, META), retailers (NKE, RH) and SPY. Also, some LCID and RKLB for funsies. 

Is this the low? I don't know. China and the EU can wait Trump out, I think. Standing up to Trump and tariffs will be domestically popular for them. Which means they will not renegotiate. Which means action must come from the US. 

But, sitting on cash for too long is foolish, unless you live in Omaha. Spy has already fallen from 613 in Feb when I went short; and from 560 in March when I went cash. Things are now a lot more attractive. 

To summarize my theory, I hope that the adults in Washington step up, stop executive overreach, and we all benefit. It might take some time. I suggest writing to your representatives in Congress. I have.

What do you guys think?",6,44,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1js2qwm/convince_me_not_be_a_bear_now_part_3/
2025-04-04 23:34:15,Meta,META,Technology stocks,"Everybody is saying that we can now buy certain stocks discounted.

However, I noticed that most of them went down around 20-25 percent ( Amazon slightly more), which seems everything went down the same. And that is not 100 percent logical.

If stock prices are going down because of probable less revenue and less profits, these drops in my view should not be the same.

1. Apple - 75 percent revenue are hardware. Almost all of it done abroad. Apple should be heavily negatively influenced from tarrifs, and in fact its one of the “better” ones with a fall of around 20-22 percent or so. 

2. Amazon - as mentioned Amazon went down more than Apple from a similar stock price of cca 230 dollars. This is because of the China trade war, and for Amazon I see an exception to my analysis.
3. Alphabet - I did not really check in detail. Shouldnt most od their revenue be services and nothing to do with tariffs? 
Alphabet/Google went from 200 to now 144. Thats again more than 25 percent.

4. META - again, what do they have to do with tariffs?
Drop around same like Google, a bit less.

5. Microsoft - again same as Alphabet and Google. Should it be really?

Tesla is out of my analysis since it was never really deeply connected to the rest in growth and fall.

Point of my quick and short analysis, am I the only one who believes not every tech stock should have suffered the same recently ?

However it’s important to listen to what Trump has said. Trump said he’s open to tarrif cuts if countries offer something phenomenal. He also said now these countries will be coming to us to negotiate rather than the other way around. He used tik tok as an example to say he may cut tarrif on china to close a tik tok deal. 

Trump put these tariffs in effect to give him huge leverage over every country. He even bragged that every country has called him to negotiate. Acting tough like the tariffs will be in place for a few years, is ONLY to increase their leverage. The more difficult it seems to remove tariffs the more negotiating power Trump has. 

This is a rare stock crash where it’s completely self inflicted with the signing of a pen from the president. This means to end this pain will ONLY take the president to end the tariffs- which can be done instantly. 

I am very sure this will be exactly like the Covid crash. He will keep talking a big talk and more and more terrible news will come out. But then there will be cracks as exceptions are made and deals are negotiated. This is literally the man who wrote “Art of the Deal”. He is 100% transactional and is always aiming to make a deal.

Tech stocks plummeted on Thursday, with Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)) leading ""Magnificent Seven"" names lower following President Trump's[ reciprocal tariff announcement](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-every-country-facing-reciprocal-tariffs-announced-by-trump-on-liberation-day-231329935.html) the day prior.

Shares of Apple, on track for their worst day since March 2020, cratered over 8% in afternoon trade as the stock erased $300 billion from its market cap. The largest risk, according to analysts, centers on the iPhone maker's overseas production hubs, which are particularly vulnerable to the tariffed countries.

On Wednesday, Trump announced tariffs that will impact some 185 countries, including the United States's largest trading partners. Additional reciprocal tariffs, for instance, will include 34% tariffs on Chinese imports, a 20% tariff on European Union imports, a 46% tariff on imports from Vietnam, 32% on imports from Taiwan, and 26% on India — all set to take effect on April 9.

Notably, the additional 34% tax on China will be added to the country's existing 20% tariff, meaning its total tariff rate will rise to 54%. China is Apple's most important [production hub](https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook-apple-supply-chain-trump-tariffs-china-diversify-iphone-2025-1?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=yahoo.com), with about 85% of its iPhones manufactured there.

""Apple produces basically all their iPhones in China, and the question will be around exceptions and exemptions on this tariff policy if those companies are building more operations, factories, and plants in the US[ like Apple announced in February](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-will-spend-more-than-500-billion-usd-in-the-us-over-the-next-four-years/),"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients following the announcement.

As trade tensions escalate, Apple has moved to increase its supply chain beyond just China, boosting manufacturing in places like India and Vietnam. But with the new tariff announcements set to impact those countries too, there's now limited room for reprieve.

""The worry will be around pricing and margin impacts along with what this means for the global supply chain looking forward,"" Ives said. For now, the analyst continues to believe major negotiations will happen over the coming months as companies attempt to navigate ""this new world of tariffs.""

Until then, he warned, ""tech stocks will clearly be under major pressure.""

Other Magnificent Seven players also faced significant selling action. In aggregate, that cohort of stocks is currently on track to eliminate over $800 billion from their collective market caps.

In afternoon trade, Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)) and Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) each fell 7%, followed by a 6% drop in both Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL)) and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)). Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)) dipped 3%, while Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)) was off just under 2%.

Outside of the Mag Seven, chip stocks faced similar declines, despite the exemption of semiconductors from Trump's additional tariffs. Nvidia competitor Broadcom ([AVGO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AVGO)), for example, erased well over $50 billion from its market cap following an 8% drop in shares.

""The implications \[of the announced tariffs\] are broad-reaching, and we see negative implications for the whole \[chip\] sector,"" KeyBanc analyst John Vinh wrote in a note to clients. ""These are most notably going to negatively impact end-demand in key markets including smartphones/iPhones and PCs, as a significant amount of manufacturing is done within China.""

Stacy Rasgon, Bernstein's managing director and senior analyst, added in an interview with Yahoo Finance that the biggest headwind for semiconductors is not necessarily the direct impact of tariffs. Rather, it's the risk of demand destruction as these products become more expensive.

He added, ""The other risk for semis is that they are very cyclical, very global, and very correlated to the macro and to GDP. [So if this tips us into recession, ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-economy-dangerously-vulnerable-to-recession-wall-street-reacts-to-tariff-fallout-155837444.html)that's probably not going to be great.""",211,63,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jqpre5/apple_sheds_300_billion_in_tarifffueled_selloff/

A sign of escalation and a warning, China is essentially responding in kind that it will give tariffs back (just like 2018). Reduced Chinese investment could result in less liquidity in the markets overall and larger volatility. If you want to see a reminder of how Chinese stocks performed when we got into a trade war, look at 2018-2019. We haven't a seen a meaningful move in these stocks yet, but if there are responses from China in kind to the tariff announcement today, things are going to get volatile,

[**SPY (S&P 500 ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SPY&p=d), [**QQQ (Invesco QQQ)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=QQQ&p=d), VXX, etc. - President Trump is set to unveil new tariffs today but is still finalizing details. Options include a tiered system (10%-20%) or a flat 20% global tariff. We're likely going to see a LOT of incremental headlines today on this until Trump speaks in the Rose Garden; I'll be watching what he says on the websites he posts on, and going for the speed trade on this. He is expected to talk at 4PM Eastern. Obviously, a lot of volatility and uncertainty due to no one knowing what exactly the tariff plans are going to be. The imposition of new tariffs could escalate trade tensions, leading to retaliatory measures from affected countries (which we don't know the extent of how many are affected) and impacting global economic growth.

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\- Tesla reported preliminary March China deliveries of 78.8K vehicles vs 89.1K YoY. The company has delivered 336,681 cars in the first quarter, far fewer than the 390,000 expected. The decline in Tesla's China deliveries was a bit of a signal that the global sales would be bad, but frankly this wasn't as terrible as I expected. Currently short, will cover if we break $260 to the upside. Also interested in the $250 level. You guys know the risks by now (BYD and competitors, Musk, politics, etc).

No real move in these stocks yet but I expect any news headline that is negative for TikTok to be great for the companies I'm watching (social media rivals). A ban on TikTok could alter the membership for the social media sites mentioned (they have to go somewhere). Since this is a weekend headline, I'm thinking of buying more GOOG- if TikTok DOES get banned, then these companies will likely gain. Otherwise, business continues as usual and they don't benefit. .",5,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jpoamx/interesting_stocks_today_042/

Two of the three major U.S. stock indexes just wrapped up their worst quarter in well over two years. The third barely avoided the same fate.

The S&P 500 dropped more than 4.5% for the first quarter of 2025 as of Monday’s close, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq plummeted 10.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average settled 1.3% lower and recorded its first back-to-back monthly loss since October 2023.

The declines on all three indexes come days before President Donald Trump is set to unveil a new slate of wide-ranging tariffs, extending ongoing trade policy turmoil that has kept investors guessing for months.

The broad-based S&P 500 fell briefly into correction territory Monday, meaning a 10% slide from its last high. The index regained some ground late in the day, but not enough to dodge its worst monthly percentage drop since December 2022.

The index’s first-quarter stumbles ended a streak of five straight winning quarters, while the Nasdaq wiped out more than half of last year’s gains over the last three months. Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Nvidia, Tesla and Meta, known on Wall Street as the “magnificent 7,” have lost more than $2 trillion in market value collectively since the start of the year.

2025-03-28 03:07:37,Meta,META,"CoreWeave, the biggest IPO of 2025. (DD on $CRWV)","# I love IPOs.

The last IPO I thought was amazing was ARM (and how far we've come!).  Coreweave (IPOing on the 28th!) is another one I think has a ton of potential. (I wrote the majority of this before the reduced IPO sizing so please forgive me if my math is incorrect).

CoreWeave is a cloud infrastructure provider specializing in GPU computing, called an “AI hyperscaler.” They run data centers full of GPUs and rent out that computing power to customers via the cloud. Similar to AWS/Azure, but they're focused on AI/ML/GPU tasks like making stupid Studio Ghibli pictures of yourself.

CRWV started in 2017 mining ETH but pivoted to being a GPU farm in 2019 after the crash. By 2022, they fully exited crypto mining and doubled down on enterprise GPU cloud services​. This early mover advantage in GPU hosting, (along with all the GPUs they bought from NVDA), have made it a player in the the cloud services space.

CRWV makes money by charging for usage-based cloud compute - clients pay for GPU hours on their servers.​ Initially, they served niches like VFX studios (movies like Interstellar take millions of GPU hours to render), but now AI training and inference workloads are the main growth driver​.

Companies like META/IBM/MSFT have used CRWV for AI compute needs in the past​. CRWV's differentiator is through software- they claim custom scheduling software (e.g. a system called “SUNK” and an optimizer “Tensorizer”) that yields better hardware utilization, faster container spin-ups, and higher throughput than general-purpose which makes them more efficient to use.

In practice, that means a customer training a large ML model might get results faster or cheaper on CRWV than on AWS. CRWV currently operates 32 data centers with 250k+ NVDA GPUs and are very aggressive in acquiring them- they deploy A100, H100, and H200s and are prioritized as customers of NVDA.

**The NVDA Relationship**

NVDA backs CRWV, and they're strong partners (which means they prioritize each other over other customers). Due to this, I dismiss the possibility that CRWV will ever have troubles on the supply side of obtaining GPUs. Something that is fairly common knowledge is that NVDA (and other companies) prefer selling GPUs in bulk because it simplifies customer service and they can charge for enterprise support and  sell thousands at a time. It's also why NVDA spits on the face of their gaming customers.

**Isn't it kind of shady that NVDA both invests and is a customer of CRWV? Why doesn't NVDA use their own chips instead of renting capacity from CRWV?**

Kind of. Nothing they've done is outright illegal (even using their GPUs as collateral is within the law). Even companies that build GPUs need to rent compute when there's a massive amount of demand. MSFT did it, NVDA did it, OpenAI WILL do it. CRWV signed a direct deal with OpenAI: a multi-year commitment up to $11.9 B for GPU cloud capacity​. They have ties to the major AI players. This entire DD going forward assumes that they will continue to keep their relationship with NVDA because NVDA needs them so AWS doesn't swallow the entire market. 

**The Financials**

CRWV has had ridiculous growth- In 2022, they had revenue of $15.8 M (the majority of which came from ETH mining). In 2023, their GPU computing pivot led to revenue of $229M, then $1.9B in 2024. This was obviously fueled by the release of ChatGPT as demand for GPU compute exploded as other companies scrambled to compete with their OWN LLM models.

By 2024, CRWV neared $2 B in annual sales, transforming from a niche player to a major cloud provider in two years.

The financial issue is that CRWV is unprofitable as it scales. In 2023, it lost \~$600M, and in 2024m \~$860M. For every $1 of revenue in 2024, they spent about $1.45 for huge investments in data centers, GPUs, and the associated operating costs (plus interest on debt they've taken out which they have a ton of).

The S-1 shows operating costs close to \~$1B from tech/infra in 2024, which includes data center space, buying/depreciating their GPUs, electricity costs, maintenance staff, etc. The capex is massive and is funded largely by debt.

The cash burn is brutal as well- at the end of 2024 CRWV still has negative FCF (which is normal for a pre-ipo high growth tech startup) and is betting that they will eventually claw their way to profitability despite the brutal looking financials (like Uber, Snowflake, Robinhood, insert your choice of tech startup here lol). The bet is that high upfront investment now will secure long-term contracts and scale to profitability later, like most tech IPOs.

**Customer Concentration**

In 2023, Microsoft accounted for \~35% of CRWV’s revenue​. In 2024, that grew to \~62% of total revenue​. Their S-1 mentioned that close to \~80% of their revenue comes from two customers alone. But this is a warning sign because MSFT wants to build their own (hence their announcement of spending \~$80B in 2025 for AI data centers).

**If MSFT scales back their use of CRWV then they are frankly fucked.** MSFT's CEO also mentioned that using external capacity (like CRWV) for GPUs was a short-term stopgap until their own investment in Azure pays off.

However, the OpenAI deal (remember that OpenAI is 49% owned by MSFT) could take the place of MSFT going forward. The contract is up to $11.9B through 2030​, which averages out to \~$2B/year if used, which is equivalent to all of CRWV's 2024 revenue.  If OpenAI maximizes their usage, CRWV’s revenue could potentially double at minimum if MSFT doesn't pull out. This is a wild hopium optimistic case but I thought it was worth mentioning.

Beyond those two, CRWV has other customers that make up the \~20% of 2024 revenue). These include research labs, VFX studios, and other tech companies but none are individually as large compared to the MSFT/OpenAI. What will make or break this company in the long run is the diversification of the client base because all their eggs are in one basket.

**IPO Technicals**

CRWV sold 37.5M shares at $40/share, getting $1.5B and giving it a $20B valuation. That was below CRWV's official target of offering 49M shares at $47-$55, raising up to $2.7B at $32B valuation​. This signals a lack of interest in the initial offering and is not great news if you already hold the stock, but is excellent if you're a short term trader that wants to see a pop on IPO day- the stock has more room to run. Yes, this means it's good for retail, bad for insiders.

**Valuation/Comparables**

Is a \~$20B valuation reasonable for CRWV? You can do a rough comparison:

|**Company**|Annual Revenue (2024)|**Recent Valuation**|**EV/Revenue Multiple**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**CoreWeave** (CRWV)|$1.92 B|\~$20B (target IPO)|\~10×|
|**Snowflake** (SNOW)|$3.41 B​|\~$52 B (market cap)|\~15× ​|
|**Databricks**\*|\~$3 B by end of 2025|\~$62 B ​|\~20×|
|**AWS** (AMZN)|$107.6 B​|\~$500 B|\~4-5×|

(That's not a typo- AWS is valued at \~$500B, it's the main driver of AMZN's growth, yet struggles to grow because it's already massive). \*Also note that Databricks is a private company

I think that if the company can maintain a hyper-growth trajectory (e.g. 2-3× growth for a couple more years), then an 10× multiple now could look cheap in hindsight. For instance, 2025 revenue could hit \~$4 B+ with the OpenAI ramp and other clients. Of course, we have risks like growth decelerating, and tariffs and Trump and China that could come in and decimate growth. And of course, they're not profitable (for now). Ironically, CRWV and other US firms would BENEFIT from chip restrictions because they'd be prioritized over the overseas ones that use NVDA chips.

CRWV’s valuation is aggressive (dare I say fair for a hyperscaler), but in line  with other cloud providers. The entire short term bull thesis depends on them retaining MSFT as a customer and also keeping OpenAI- if that occurs then investing in it now looks like a no-brainer. If not, **it's completely possible we see an 50%+ selloff. I think that's the reason why we're seeing such hesitancy in this valuation.**

This valuation is also dependent on entirely dependent on AI spending GROWING, society seeing greater integration in AI (more than we have now), and AI firms willing to continue spending on compute they can't harness themselves. We are still supply constrained on GPUs in general, and if we ever experience NVDA building more GPUs than there is demand for, then Coreweave's margins are threatened and profitability can vanish. For now, it looks like that is unlikely to happen.

**IPO Trading Details**

37.5M shares is decent IPO volume so I don't expect this to be illiquid when it trades. The main things I watch for are indication price (whether there are people who want to buy the print of the stock higher than what we IPO at) and share paired (which somewhat signal when the IPO will open for trading).

Overall, this is a pure AI play on GPU compute, a bet that demand for GPUs will continue to outstrip supply,  and that MSFT/OpenAI/every other tech firm involved won't slit their throat in in the eternal game of thrones that is capitalism.

**TL;DR:** There's a hell of a lot of risk, but I like the stock. It's completely possible it could open and sell off because the insiders just want to bail. It's possible that it skyrockets. Anything is possible in the wild and crazy world of IPO trading.

2025-03-26 21:22:13,Meta,META,"Meta Investing Thesis: Still Compounding, Still Dominating","Meta has staged one of the most remarkable comebacks in tech history. After being written off in 2022 amid Apple’s privacy changes, TikTok competition, and an uncertain metaverse pivot, the company has bounced back stronger than ever. Its ad engine is running hot again, user engagement is rising, and it's making massive AI infrastructure investments to future-proof the business. With durable moats, expanding monetization surfaces, and strong financial discipline, Meta is no longer just a recovery story — it’s a mature compounding machine with clear upside potential from here.

* **Financial resurgence:** $164.5B revenue (+22% YoY), $62.3B net income (+59%), 42% operating margin, and $52.1B in free cash flow in 2024. ROE stood at \~34%, showcasing strong capital efficiency at scale.
* **Durable moats:** Meta’s 4B+ user base powers an unmatched data advantage. Its AI feedback loop, social graph, multi-surface presence (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp), and cross-app identity infrastructure create high switching costs and network effects that competitors can't replicate.
* **AI infrastructure bet:** Meta is investing $60–65B in 2025 to scale its AI infrastructure — including custom silicon (MTIA chips), Llama foundation models, and massive inference-optimized data centers. These are mostly fixed costs, setting up future operating leverage as growth Capex tapers.
* **Next leg of growth:**
   1. **Messaging monetization** — Click-to-Message ads, in-chat commerce, and AI agents on WhatsApp and Instagram
   2. **AI-driven ads** — Automated campaign creation (Advantage+), performance boosts for SMBs and creators
   3. **AR/VR optionality** — Quest 3, smart glasses, and a path toward mass-market AR by 2027. This is more of optionality now. If this works out, can create significant additional revenue. 

* **Valuation (Base Case):** EPS grows to \~$44 by 2029 with steady 10–11% top-line growth. At a 20x multiple, the stock could reach \~$875 → **\~6.9% CAGR from today**.
* **Valuation (Bull Case):** If WhatsApp hits $20B+ revenue and AI tools gain traction, EPS could hit $50 by 2030. At 25x multiple → **$1,250 stock (\~12.6% CAGR)**.

  
In summary, Meta has transformed from a struggling giant in 2022 to a cash-generating, AI-powered compounding machine in 2025. With $62B in profit, 4B users, deep data moats, and massive AI infrastructure bets, it’s positioned for steady, long-term growth across ads and messaging with the Reality Labs optionality.

Major indexes closed slightly higher Tuesday as the stock market continued its recovery from an extended selloff.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite added 0.2% and 0.5%, respectively, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose fractionally. Stocks had kicked off the week with big gains following news that President Trump could scale back some of the tariffs that are due to be imposed next week on U.S. trading partners. With the recent gains, the Dow has inched back into positive territory for 2025, as stocks have rebounded from a month-long selloff spurred by concerns about the potential impact of tariffs and uncertainty about the outlook for the economy.

Investors brushed off consumer confidence data released this morning that came in weaker than expected, with the index hitting its lowest level in more than four years. Investors are closing watching all data points amid worries that tariffs could reignite inflation and cause economic growth to stall. The big economic report of the week comes Friday with the scheduled release of the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which had fallen during the recent stock market rout amid the growing concerns about the economy, was at 4.32% in late trading, down from 4.33% at yesterday's close and from an earlier high Tuesday of 4.37%. The yield, which affects costs on all sorts of loans, notably mortgages, hit its highest level in more than a month this morning.

Mega-cap technology stocks, which helped lead Monday's rally, were mostly higher again today. Shares of Tesla (TSLA) rallied late in the day to finish 3.5% higher, gaining ground for the 5th consecutive session, despite news Tuesday that the EV maker's sales in Europe continued to slide. Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta Platforms (META) each rose more than 1%, while Microsoft (MSFT) inched ahead. Chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) closed slightly lower

2025-03-21 00:54:15,Meta,META,Short sellers have made $15 billion betting against Tesla and Nvidia in 2025,"Short sellers have been cleaning up to start 2025 amid a massive sell-off in some of the market's most popular names over the past two years.

Short sellers have made a combined $15 billion betting against Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) stock thus far this year, according to data from S3 Partners. Tesla shorts alone have raked in nearly $11 billion, while bets against Nvidia have brought in more than $4 billion.

Tesla's 40% year-to-date drop has led the declines of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks. Investors have grown concerned about CEO Elon Musk's focus on government efficiency efforts and how his role with President Trump's administration could be a turnoff to the electric vehicle maker's customer base.

But it hasn't just been Tesla lagging. As an index, the Magnificent Seven — which also includes Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) — is underperforming the S&P 500 this quarter by the most since 2022.

Short sellers have profited off of all of the names in the cohort this year. They've brought in nearly $5 billion betting against Apple stock, which is down nearly 14% in 2025.

The crash in the most popular trade of the past two years comes as investors have been re-rating their growth expectations. Fears of slowing economic growth and the impact of Trump's tariff policies have weighed on markets. Meanwhile, Big Tech has faced growing investor criticism about its ballooning AI spend and whether or not it will eventually boost future profits as much as Wall Street hopes. The year also included a massive drawdown in some large tech names, including Nvidia, following the release of a cheaper AI model from Chinese company DeepSeek.

Now, with most of the names sitting around 20% off their recent 52-week highs, the looming question for markets is whether or not investor appetite for the stocks that led the market higher for the past two years will return.

""Maybe these tech stocks got ahead of their skis a little bit,"" BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski told Yahoo Finance last week.

2025-03-15 17:58:22,Meta,META,Why $RDDT Is A Must Have Stock,"Reddit is one of the premier social media apps out there with a cheap valuation (never judge a growth stock by P/E) for its growth trajectory.

Let's start with the fundamentals:

1. 2024 YE it had a 90.5% gross profit percentage, revenue grew by 62% (NVIDIA like growth??) and it became FCF positive. Next quarter revenue will be growing at 50% to ultimately end at 40% YoY based on guidance. I've been following $RDDT for quite some time and there is always a beat on revenue AND guidance versus what they expected so you can say there is a little bit of conservatism in this numbers.
2. From a balance sheet perspective it only has $26.7mm of debt. This company generated $215mm in FCF this year and is forecast to double to $520mm by next year. Capex spend is only 2% of its revenue. This companies management loves to run things efficiently and as cheaply as possible. On going concern is not an issue.
3. The company is already EPS positive and will turn EPS positive on a YoY basis by 2025 YE. If you look at it from a PEG perspective, it is trading at 0.74 for 2026. Anything below 1 is cheap. The only reason you see negative EPS is because the company has been expensing stock based compensation (US GAAP) requirement each quarter. This has ended in 2024, that is why you see major acceleration in EPS growth QoQ moving forward.
4. Share dilution is very minimal. A lot of growth companies like to pay employees in stock to attract talent, but that is not what reddit does. Diluated shares outstanding actually fell 1% in QoQ. This is great for any share holder.
5. Reddit data is a gold mine. Google pays Reddit $66mm a year for data licensing. This has 85% operating margin - so you need to remember Reddits profitability isn't going away anytime soon because you are starting from a high point.
6. Insider trading has popped up this weekend after the crazy drop. That is a significant buy signal.
7. From a multiple standpoint, price to sales, revenue etc it has gotten cheaper despite the stock increasing in value. Reddit user growth has exploded over time, with 50% international base and is becoming a hit globally. Reddit's top 15 advertisers spent 50% more YoY and international ad revenue grew by 77%.

\- THIS IS IMPORTANT. If US were to go slow down, the international piece provides a buffer on revenue for the company.

8) Advertising approach is incredibly unique. Reddit offers companies the ability to have AMAs to offer product information. I've personally seen this in my time using this reddit. Each subreddit is highly specialized which makes advertising that much easier. People pay Meta and Google top dollar because they are able to use statistical AI inference to generate ad campaigns well. Reddit doesn't need that. If you sell bikes, there's a laundry list of bike subreddits you can target. This is the future as Ad targeting improves on Reddit.

Downside / Bear bases:

1. Highly dependent on Google search. Google search was the reason that Reddit fell after earnings because of the average daily user count fell. Management has said this happens often in its existence and they worked quickly to get back on top of user searches. Management was largely dismissive of this because of their experience and noted higher levels of people asking questions and typing reddit at the end into google.
2. AI Capex slows down. This will erode profitability on the company, but given how ""clean"" reddit data is, this is the least of my concerns.
3. Execution and ad platform growth. Growing is expensive, and if Reddit adopts a spend what you can to get it done it will have investors fearful. Based on their CFO's commentary this is not very likely because how they approach things and history shows.
4. User growth slows down. This is highly possible, but I do believe the international side of things will be a buffer on user growth.

Having said all of this, my PT is $250 for the company. This is an absolute long term hold.

Any dips should be bought and even though Reddit looks expensive at face value, it really isn't. It trades at 50x forward earnings with 50% YoY growth and a net profitability that will approach 30+%.

2025-03-13 00:06:31,Meta,META,Trump’s FTC Moves Ahead With Broad Microsoft Antitrust Probe,">The US Federal Trade Commission is moving ahead with a sprawling antitrust probe of Microsoft Corp. that was opened in the waning days of the Biden Administration, signaling that Donald Trump’s new FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson is going to prioritize scrutiny of tech giants.

>FTC staff in recent weeks have continued to work on the investigation, meeting with companies and other groups to gather information, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named discussing a confidential investigation.

>The FTC sent Microsoft a so-called civil investigative demand, which is similar to a subpoena, late last year. The document, a copy of which was viewed by Bloomberg, compels the company to turn over reams of data about its AI operations, including the cost to train models and obtain data, going as far back as 2016. The agency sought details about Microsoft’s data centers, its struggles to find enough computing power to meet customer demand and the company’s software licensing practices.

>The FTC is also scrutinizing Microsoft’s decision to slash funding on its own artificial intelligence projects after striking a deal with OpenAI, which could be perceived as hurting competition in the burgeoning AI market.

>One company has heard regularly from the FTC on the issue of Microsoft’s licensing practices since the investigative demand was sent, said one of the people. The FTC and lawyers for that company have discussed what information the agency could ask for in a more comprehensive, formal request. The company also received a shorter list of questions several weeks ago asking for documents the company provided to other regulators. The FTC is further seeking information about licensing rule changes Microsoft said will go into effect later this year, the person said.

>The agency said in the information demand that it wants to determine whether Microsoft’s profits from other parts of the business give it an edge over other AI companies. The agency also said it wants details about Microsoft’s data center capacity constraints to better understand the costs behind cloud-computing services. Those details will help the agency determine whether to bring a case.

>Since receiving the FTC demand, Microsoft may have sought to narrow the scope of the information it’s being asked to turn over — a typical move by companies being probed by the agency. Such wide-ranging antitrust investigations can take years and don’t always result in the agency bringing a case.

>“We are working cooperatively with the agency,” said Alex Haurek, a Microsoft spokesman. The FTC didn’t respond to a request for comment.

>The evolution of the probe now rests in the hands of Ferguson and his new head of competition, Daniel Guarnera, who joined the agency from the Justice Department, where he worked on antitrust cases targeting Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Apple Inc.

>In his first public remarks since taking the chair position in late February, Ferguson said investigating the tech sector is his highest priority. Early moves include seeking information on censorship by tech companies.

>Ferguson also backed a filing in January in support of billionaire Elon Musk, who sued to derail OpenAI’s plans to restructure as a more conventional for-profit business.

>The civil investigative demand was crafted by FTC staff and personally signed off on by former Chair Lina Khan after the agency spent more than a year conducting informal interviews with Microsoft competitors and business partners, Bloomberg previously reported.

>Ferguson’s FTC has inherited several other cases against big tech companies from Khan, including lawsuits against Meta Platforms Inc. and [Amazon](http://Amazon.com) Inc. On Wednesday, the agency asked a judge to delay a trial challenging Amazon’s Prime subscription practices, citing resource constraints at the agency. The FTC quickly walked back comments that resource constraints at the agency will hamper its ability to start a trial in September.

>Most of the questions in the information demand relate to how Microsoft licenses its software products, particularly as it relates to the company’s cloud-computing business. Competitors have complained that Microsoft’s licensing terms and bundling of both its popular office productivity and security software with its cloud offerings makes it harder for them to compete.

>About a third of the questions focus on Microsoft’s AI business, highlighting the importance of the burgeoning technology to the company’s future. Underlying the FTC’s requests are concerns that Microsoft canceled some of its own work after deciding to invest in deciding to invest in OpenAI and learning heavily on its GPT software, eliminating potential competition.

>Despite the hefty sum, Microsoft didn’t disclose its investment to competition regulators ahead of time, and the FTC also has been investigating whether the deal was structured as a partnership to avoid a merger investigation, Bloomberg has reported.

>When Microsoft first invested in OpenAI in 2019, the startup was a promising research lab looking for a way to fund the cloud-computing power required to create AI models. Microsoft started with a $1 billion infusion after co-founder Musk withdrew his backing. Microsoft had been working on various AI projects of its own for more than two decades and feared it was falling behind rival Google.

>The company’s efforts were scattered across several divisions and not producing the results Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella had hoped for. In 2023, one month after pumping an additional $10 billion into OpenAI, Microsoft began unveiling a series of products infused with OpenAI technology. Microsoft pulled back on its internal effort to develop the technology, which raised a red flag for the FTC is going to prioritize scrutiny of tech giants.

>FTC staff in recent weeks have continued to work on the investigation, meeting with companies and other groups to gather information, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named discussing a confidential investigation.

Amazon, Alphabet’s Google and Meta Platforms on Wednesday said they support efforts to at least triple nuclear energy worldwide by 2050.

The tech companies signed a pledge first adopted in December 2023 by more than 20 countries, including the U.S., at the U.N. Climate Change Conference. Financial institutions including Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley backed the pledge last year.


The pledge is nonbinding, but highlights the growing support for expanding nuclear power among leading industries, finance and governments.

Amazon, Google and Meta are increasingly important drivers of energy demand in the U.S. as they build out artificial intelligence centers. The tech sector is turning to nuclear power after concluding that renewables alone won’t provide enough reliable power for their energy needs.

Amazon and Google announced investments last October to help launch small nuclear reactors, technology still under development that the industry hopes will reduce the cost and timelines that have plagued new reactor builds in the U.S.

Meta issued a call in December for nuclear developers to submit proposals to help the tech company add up to four gigawatts of new nuclear in the U.S.

The pledge signed Wednesday was led by the World Nuclear Association on the sidelines of the CERAWeek by S&P Global energy conference in Houston.",369,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j9japl/amazon_google_and_meta_support_tripling_nuclear/
2025-03-11 19:48:09,Meta,META,SNAP Stock Discussion Signs of Being Oversold,"SNAP (Snapchat) became profitable in the last quarter and it had plenty of positive news.

On the Earnings Day report SNAP has seen 13.40 USD during after market however after that the price came lower in an unexpected way.

SNAP hasn't seen any 2 consecutive green daily candles since the Earnings Report.

Here is the good and bad news about SNAP:

Good News:

1. SNAP is likely to beat the upcoming earnings report expectations and become more profitable.
2. Price extremely low standing below 9 USD.
3. Due to China Tariffs, TikTok likely will not be sold to the US. Future Ad revenue from TikTok is likely to flow into SNAP and META.
4. SNAP has growing user base.
5. The company does not have political stance (Spiegel was not at Trump inauguration) It is unknown if Trump cares about the markets and the stocks/companies he talks about got negatively affected recently.
6. New Generative Video Announcement
7. 26% revenue increase in India

Bad News:

1. Executives are still selling the stock.
2. The company does not have any political stance. (Spiegel was not at Trump inauguration) Might keep going down because pro republican companies seem like they will be going up sooner.
3. The price is not going up despite being too low. It's almost as if SNAP got decoupled from the market and heading down on its own.
4. Oracle recently announced they would help Tiktok with the operations.

Any thoughts on SNAP? Will the price go back to ATHs at 80 USD any time soon? What are your thoughts?",8,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j8zr7b/snap_stock_discussion_signs_of_being_oversold/

“due too uncertainty companies will halt hiring and due to increased operating costs companies will stop advertising”

But then in the case if companies likes NVDA, the AI front runner. How will tariffs affect the sales of chips?

2025-03-11 01:35:26,Meta,META,Tech megacaps lose over $750 billion in market cap in worst day for Nasdaq since 2022,"It’s gone from bad to worse for tech investors.

With the Nasdaq suffering its steepest drop since 2022 on Monday, the seven most valuable tech companies lost more than $750 billion in market value. Recession fears and concerns about a trade war drove the selloff.

Apple led the megacap losses, with its value plummeting by about $174 billion. Nvidia shaved off almost $140 billion in market value and shares closed down 5%. The leading AI chipmaker has lost nearly a third of its value just two months after notching a fresh high in January.

Tesla had the biggest percentage loss, with shares of the electric vehicle maker tumbling 15%, their worst day since 2020. The company has lost more than half its value since its stock price peaked in mid-December**.** The stock is also coming off its longest weekly losing streak in history as a public company.

Tesla lost $130 billion in value on Monday, while Microsoft and Alphabet lost $98 billion and $95 billion, respectively. Amazon lost $50 billion and Meta lost $70 billion.

Alphabet and Meta dropped more than 4% on Monday, while Microsoft and Amazon dropped at least 2% each. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund fell more than 4%, entering correction territory. Shares are more than 14% off their high.

Heavy selling intensified across the tech, with the Nasdaq falling to a six-month low. Many tech companies rely on parts and manufacturing overseas and new levies could push up prices. That’s also sparked worries of a U.S. recession, which Trump didn’t rule out over the weekend.

Semiconductor makers have also felt the pain, with the sector a primary target of new tariffs. Last week, the president announced an additional $100 billion investment from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and called the company the “most powerful” in the world as he looks to boost domestic production.

The VanEck Semiconductor ETF has plunged 3% over the past week and is down more than 16% since the inauguration. Heavy selling rattled the sector again Monday, with the ETF last down roughly 5%. Marvell Technology shed 8%, while ASML Holding and Micron Technology slumped more than 6% each. Broadcom fell 5%.

TD Cowen analysts in a note Friday said the tech giant had scrapped leases for sizeable data center capacity in the United States, suggesting potential oversupply as it builds out artificial intelligence infrastructure.The brokerage, citing its supply chain checks, said Microsoft has canceled leases totaling ""a couple of hundred megawatts"" of capacity with at least two private data-center operators, the analysts led by Michael Elias said.Microsoft's plan to invest over $80 billion in AI and cloud capacity this fiscal year remains on track, a company spokesperson said.

**Catalyst:** Some catalysts today: Deepseek cuts API pricing by 75%, NVDA is reporting earnings, ChatGPT is doing a limited rollout of ChatGPT 4.5, META considering $200B AI data center.

NVDA reporting earnings is the main catalyst today and decides the immediate direction of the market.

**Technicals:** Mainly interested in seeing if NVDA misses revenue (unlikely) or if they say anything significant due to new export controls which I talked about yesterday (strengthening of CHIPS Act export controls to China).

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** NVDA leads in semis design, is a multi-billion dollar company, etc.

**Risks:** I'm currently positioned defensively (sold calls against my position since I have a decent cost basis from back when DeepSeek news released, so overall will just sit on hands and get out of my position if the earnings are bad).

**Technicals:** Massive selloff since post-election highs- $300 was a significant level I was watching at the time and we exploded past that, so interested to see if we're able to hold above it.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** BYD is a major competitor to TSLA and will likely overtake them in the future, and Musk's political actions are seen as controversial in Europe.

**Catalyst:** The CC market is experiencing a selloff mainly due to proposed tariffs and the hack at Bybit, resulting in the loss of \~$1.5 billion.

**Technicals:** Not too interested in playing this long- still watching to see how we perform but the sell off has continued, waiting for a larger move still.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** China has been going through a spending crisis, and the government's decision to inject substantial capital into its major banks is a move to strengthen liquidity. This initiative aims to enhance the lending capacity of banks, support local government financing, and stabilize the broader economy. It's a (pre) bailout baby.

**Risks:** This does signal that China sees economic weakness, such as lack of demand due to their real estate sector they've traditionally leaned on for consumer growth/investment. Is this a long term fix? Who knows, but it worked for the US!

**Related Tickers:** JD, BIDU

**Ticker: SMCI**

**Catalyst:** They finally filed an hour before the deadline on the final day! Really cutting it close there lol. The company has faced allegations of accounting irregularities. These allegations, along with a failure to file specific financial forms have been a plague for the past year on the stock price. 

**Technicals:** We've seen a 20% move AH, so worth watching at open to see if we move further. Other than that, watching $50/$55 level. We'll see where it goes but worth noting that we've made a significant move back to pre-delisting threat prices already.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Was at threat of delisting from the NASDAQ but now they're safe baby.

**Risks:** People getting out, or the filing being rejected/advised to resubmit. The latter is a massive catalyst but low probability.

News: [Trump Administration Seeks More Restrictions On China Tech Weighs Nvidia Curbs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-25/trump-administration-seeks-more-restrictions-on-china-tech-weighs-nvidia-curbs)

**Catalyst:** The Trump administration is planning to strengthen semiconductor export controls to China, aiming to strengthen the CHIPS act from Biden's term.

Additionally, DeepSeek is accelerating the release of its new AI model, R2, following the success of its R1 model. (Most of their training is done on NVDA chips)

**Technicals:** Mainly interested to see if we can hold above $130 for NVDA- note that earnings are tomorrow so the short-term performance of the stock hinges on that. Currently long and sold 155C to hedge my position against it.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** We've seen the CHIPS act actually affect the way that semiconductor companies sell to China- most of those restrictions are bypassed, so this strengthening of export controls might actually affect the industry.

**Risks:** More export controls may lead to China giving tariffs in retaliation- but again, most semis are supply constrained rather than demand constrained so I don't see it as a significant catalyst until more details are released.

**Catalyst:** BABA has introduced its own AI reasoning model within the Qwen framework (like how META has the Llama framework), while we have a surge of all Chinese stock performance following the Chinese government's announcement of liquidity measures.

**Technicals:** It seems as if we've peaked (BABA has gone up close to 50% since the start of this month) for most Chinese stocks in the past few days, I would be interested in being short but I was on vacation this weekend. Interested in shorting BABA specifically if we make another large up move like we did on 2/20.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** BABA is one of the major competitors that is working on AI models, and is notably using NVDA cards to train its models. 

**Risks:** Mainly tariff news and news from other rivals with better models. Straightforward.

**Ticker:** [**PLTR (Palantir Technologies Inc)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Previously, PLTR faced concerns due to defense budget cuts and CEO Alex Karp reducing his stake in the company. We've seen it make a massive run from retail and fall just as quickly.

**Technicals:** Interested in playing a small bounce- we're up \~10% since last earnings report (and pre-crazy move), there is potential for a small bounce here but only entering a small position since it looks like we bottomed early premarket today. 

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Trump directed the government to make significant cuts to the defense budget. (This is a far more significant catalyst than Alex Karp selling shares)

**Risks:** PLTR lives and dies on defense contract money, so obviously further cuts/expansions will affect stock price.

**Catalyst:** The CC market is experiencing heightened volatility due to proposed tariffs and a significant security breach at Bybit, resulting in the loss of approximately $1.5 billion.

**Technicals:** Not too interested in playing this long- still watching to see how we perform but the sell off resulting in the biggest Coin going to $90K has me watching the stock related proxies that deal with the market. 

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** CC platforms are highly susceptible to regulatory changes and security incidents.

Proposed tariffs affecting digital assets can lead to market vol, while large-scale hacks undermine investor trust and lead to sell-offs in the market as it spreads fear and people wanting to cash out.

**Risks:** Regulatory interventions impose additional compliance costs and operational constraints on CC exchanges.

Security breaches not only result in financial losses but also lead to decreased user adoption and revenue.

Palantir has been on a tear recently, all hyped up on the defense sector growth but no one is really paying attention to Meta Defense and their entry to the space. Last year Meta opened up its AI models to defense agencies and contractors. This is huge for them to get this level of clearance and i think this will will put them in direct competition with Palantir. Im not sure how they build out this branch of Meta, Im calling it Meta Defense but they fired all their woke people and are starting to re-shape the company.

Yes, there is defense spending cuts but its all on waste and overcharged contracts not on things that actually matter for the dept of defense. During the inauguration Zuckerberg was in the front row, Hegseth was somewhere in the back. Just an observation.

Everyone is familiar with their social media business so there isnt a whole lot to talk about there. AI keeps improving, More growth from Reels, Threads, Facebook. Their LLM is impressive and arguably one of the best, putting them up there with OpenAI.

With all there user data they have Meta Analytics could be another source of revenue.

They are sitting on a goldmine with Facebook market place. i get they have ads but i feel they could do more.  Im not sure Zuckerberg realized what he has there but this business if monetized right could be HUGE.

2025-02-14 16:44:21,Meta,META,Meta plans major investment into AI-powered humanoid robots,"[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-plans-major-investment-ai-160000083.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-plans-major-investment-ai-160000083.html)

Meta Platforms Inc., after pushing into augmented reality and artificial intelligence, has identified its next big bet: AI-powered humanoid robots.

The company is making a significant investment into the category — futuristic robots that can act like humans and assist with physical tasks — and is forming a new team within its Reality Labs hardware division to conduct the work, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

Meta plans to work on its own humanoid robot hardware, with an initial focus on household chores. Its bigger ambition is to make the underlying AI, sensors and software for robots that will be manufactured and sold by a range of companies, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the initiative hasn’t been announced.

Meta has started discussing its plan with robotics companies, including Unitree Robotics and Figure AI Inc. At least initially, it doesn’t plan to build a Meta-branded robot — something that could directly rival Tesla Inc.’s Optimus — but it may consider doing so in the future, the people added.

The humanoid effort mirrors exploratory projects at other technology giants, including Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google Deepmind division. A Meta spokesperson declined to comment.

Meta confirmed the creation of the new team to employees Friday, telling them it will be led by Marc Whitten, who resigned as chief executive officer of General Motors Co.’s Cruise self-driving car division earlier this month. He was previously an executive at gaming company Unity Software Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.

“The core technologies we’ve already invested in and built across Reality Labs and AI are complementary to developing the advancements needed for robotics,” Andrew Bosworth, Meta’s chief technology officer, wrote in a memo reviewed by Bloomberg News. He mentioned the company’s advancements in hand tracking, computing at low bandwidth and always-on sensors.

Meta executives believe that while humanoid robotics companies have made headway in hardware, Meta’s advances in artificial intelligence and data collected from augmented and virtual reality devices could accelerate progress in the nascent industry. Current humanoids are still not useful enough to fold clothes, carry a glass of water, place dishes in a rack for cleaning or conduct other home chores that could get consumers interested in the category.

“We believe that expanding our portfolio to invest in this field will only accrue value to Meta AI and our mixed and augmented reality programs,” Bosworth wrote. Whitten, who will report to Bosworth, will have headcount to hire around 100 engineers this year, one of the people said.

Meta’s goal is to provide what Google’s Android operating system and Qualcomm Inc.’s chips did for the phone industry by building a foundation for the rest of the market.

The software, sensors and computing packages that Meta is already developing for its devices are the same technologies that are needed to power humanoids, according to one of the people involved in the project.

Meta has been investing billions of dollars for years into its Reality Labs hardware division, which sells products like the Quest VR headset and the increasingly popular Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta plans to spend $65 billion this year on related products, including artificial intelligence infrastructure and the new robot work.",119,86,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ipetzp/meta_plans_major_investment_into_aipowered/

Questions:

	1.	I currently hold 29 stocks, which seems excessive. Are there any that you’d recommend as an immediate SELL?

	2.	Lately, I’ve been increasing my ETF allocation while reducing exposure to volatile stocks. Does this seem like a solid strategy, or should I continue investing in blue-chip tech stocks to maintain strong returns?

	3.	Any other feedback or recommendations?

**Technicals:** Nothing to do but wait until 1 PM.

**Catalyst:** Trump said that he promises reciprocal tariffs today. This will likely be on China because they are the only country left of the three (Canada/Mexico). He stated he'll give details at 1 PM on Truth Social.

**Risks:** More volatility near that time, going to position accordingly depending on the context of the tweet, but likely will be trading VXX unless something very context specific.

**Ticker:** [**DDOG (Datadog, Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DDOG&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Earnings with an EPS of $0.49 vs. $0.43 expected. Revenue of $738M vs. $714.5M expected.

**Technicals:** Not too interested in this unless we break $130 after the open.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Cloud security sector is overall growing due to enterprise adoption, but DDOG cited $3.185B vs $3.24B of revenue guidance, slightly lower than expected.

**Risks:** More tariffs, rising/flat interest rates when we expected them to be cut, mostly macro factors when faced with more technology spending.

**Related Tickers:** S, CRWD

**Ticker:** [**BIDU (Baidu, Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BIDU&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Baidu announced that its AI chatbot, Ernie Bot, will be available for free starting April 1, citing advancements in technology and reduced costs.

**Technicals:** Had a decent spike premarket, will be watching if this breaks $100 or not.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** AI is getting cheaper and cheaper; this is a decision similar to DeepSeek to attract users. Will be testing capabilities personally to see how it goes. These competitors are rising to meet OpenAI mainly in price, (can you really get better than free?) and are content with being ""second-best"" as long as customers can save in price and they can save in training costs. Ultimately, I see it as a viable strategy because the average white-collar worker doesn't need the highest performing LLMs.

**Technicals:** Overall a blowout, watching the $65 level.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Resurgence in retail trading activity, particularly in cryptocurrencies. Also cited election betting as a major revenue factor. Also announced three major events - new advisory features, crypto events, and the 'HOOD Summit' from the past.

**Risks:** The company's growth is mainly being driven by crypto, which may be curbed by the SEC (but Gensler is gone so I doubt it).

**Related Tickers:** COIN (also has earnings today!)

**Technicals:** Overall the earnings were good - I have no idea why it fell. Also seems like the market agrees; it's recovered some of the move. The only thing I can find was Reddit's daily active users was 101.7M, slightly below expectations of 103.24M.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Reddit cited that their Trends Feature has significant interest from advertisers, but beyond that still not 100% sure as to why the drop.

2025-02-13 13:42:23,Meta,META,Apple’s Stock-Market Performance Is Increasingly Made in China,"* Country is both a significant market and key production hub
* Apple has underperformed other Big Tech stocks this year

>Investors in America’s biggest company are increasingly focused on China, where Apple Inc. is striving to win over a crucial customer base while also facing tariff-related risks.

>The iPhone maker counts China as a significant market and a major manufacturing hub. If it improves its flagging sales in the country with artificial intelligence features in its devices, that could be a key catalyst to revive the investment case. On the other hand, tariffs and the prospect of an escalating trade war represent risks of unknown magnitude.

>Read: Apple’s China Focus Thrusts It Into Center of Geopolitical Fight

>“Apple’s level of exposure to China is a risk relative to much of the rest of the market,” said Matt Stucky, chief equity portfolio manager at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management. The prospect of Apple being in the crosshairs of tariffs or investigations should be on investors’ radars, he said.

>“However, if AI iPhones are a success, that could mean steady growth over the next several years,” he added.

>The shares are down 5.4% in 2025, making Apple the worst performer among the Magnificent 7 except for Tesla Inc. Sentiment has soured in recent months, with tepid demand for the iPhone 16 — the first to incorporate AI features — and tariff risks weighing. The company’s recent results were mixed, featuring disappointing China and iPhone sales, though the forecast was seen as encouraging.

>Improving China sales would be significant. Apple got about 17% of its fiscal 2024 revenue from the greater China region, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, compared with about 26% for Europe and more than 40% for the Americas.

>The potential for improved trends in China was demonstrated this week, when Apple jumped on a broadly negative day for markets following a report that it has started working with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to bring AI features to Apple products in China. The Chinese firm’s chairman confirmed the partnership on Thursday.

>“We would view this as a critical catalyst for Apple’s competitive standing in China,” Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring wrote earlier this week. Citing a survey the firm conducted, he added that Chinese iPhone users are more interested in AI than US or European peers, and that more than 50% said the staggered roll out of Apple Intelligence had “a moderate to significant impact on their decision not to upgrade to a new iPhone this cycle.”

>Any improvement would also come after a period of muted growth compared with Big Tech peers. Apple’s revenue has fallen in five of the past nine quarters, and while analysts expect 4.9% growth in fiscal 2025, this is less than half the 11.6% pace expected for the overall tech sector, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.

>Within this context, geopolitical tensions loom large. The Trump administration imposed 10% tariffs against China, and the country retaliated with tariffs of its own. China is also weighing a potential probe into Apple’s policies and App Store fees.

>Analysts are so far downplaying the risk of tariffs, though they note uncertainties like how long they might be in place and whether Apple will get an exemption. Evercore ISI sees an impact “in the range of 3-4% of EPS,” which it described as “relatively minimal.” Bank of America said the impact on earnings should be “limited” and “manageable.”

>Still, Apple’s valuation suggests limited room for error. Shares trade at 31 times estimated earnings, roughly 50% above their average over the past decade. The stock also trades at a premium to the broader market and the overall tech sector.

>Following multiple downgrades this year, just over 60% of analysts recommend buying the stock, a rate well below megacaps like Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp., Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc., or Meta Platforms Inc.

>Still, investors continue to view Apple as a relatively defensive stock given its strong cash flow, massive buyback program, high-margin services business, and a lack of heavy spending on AI.

>“Apple looks a little problematic in the short term given the valuation and the lack of growth, but you’re not going to find a more impressive cash-cow of a company,” said Wayne Kaufman, chief market analyst at Phoenix Financial Services. “There’s a reason it remains an institutional and retail favorite.”

2025-02-11 22:20:13,Meta,META,TSLA isn't the NVIDIA of EV's anymore,"

I’m no Tesla expert, and I’m sure plenty of people know way more about the company than I do, but I wanted to throw out some thoughts and see what you all think.



Right now, TSLA is sitting around $330 a share, up 75% YOY. But honestly, I see some major red flags:



📉 Shrinking Profit Margins – Tesla’s margins have been steadily declining for years. Not a great trend.



🏴‍☠️ Musk’s PR Nightmare – Elon literally gave a “Sieg Heil” on live TV. Now, a huge chunk of the world sees him (and by extension, Tesla) as a Nazi. That’s… not exactly great for brand reputation.



🚗 Cybertruck is a Mess – Poor build quality, tons of issues, and at this point, it’s basically a meme.



🌍 New Political & Tariff Risks – Tesla is vulnerable to steel and aluminum tariffs, an anti-EV U.S. President, and a California governor who hates Musk and might pull state EV rebates.



⚡ Serious Competition is Catching Up – Tesla isn’t the undisputed EV/FSD leader anymore. Other companies are matching—or surpassing—them in innovation.



🚦 FSD is Overhyped – Despite all the robotaxi talk, Tesla’s self-driving tech is still only Level 2-3. Meanwhile, other companies already have Level 4 robotaxis on the road.



🔋 Rising Costs = Profit Squeeze – Raw material costs are going up, and Trump’s tariffs on China-made batteries could make things even worse.



🤖 Tesla is Struggling to Attract Top AI Talent – Even before Musk’s latest antics, nearly all top AI researchers and recent ML PhD graduates from the top schools were choosing OpenAI, Anthropic, or GAMMA (Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Apple) over Tesla or xAI. Now? Even fewer want to work there, which could hurt Tesla’s AI progress.



🔵 Losing Left-Leaning Consumers – Left-leaning buyers are way more likely to buy EVs than right-leaning ones. And almost every left-leaning consumer has grown to despise Musk, leading them to choose non-Tesla EVs instead.



Tesla used to be the Nvidia of EVs—they were miles ahead of everyone else. But that’s just not the case anymore. There are more non-Tesla EV options every year, and in terms of FSD, several companies already have a better product and better talent. So, to me, a $1.1 trillion valuation feels ridiculous.

Meta up 19% YTD. Strong Q4 results & strong guidance

Alphabet down 7% in the past month. Google Cloud miss & high Capex

Microsoft down 2% for the same reasons. Azure miss & high capex

TSLA down 8% with weak EV deliveries

Apple down 7% YTD. iPhone sales down 1%, China revenue down 11%, revenue growth of just ""low to mid single digits"" for the upcoming quarter 

NVIDIA down 6% YTD. DeepSeek's cost-effective model raises questions

Amazon down 4% after releasing earnings recently. AWS results came in lower than expected & guidance for next quarter's revenue & profit came up short

Curious what others go from here. For some long-term investors, it's a dip for a buying opportunity. Some might stay away given limited upside with DeepSeek, high Capex, and softer revenue growth.

2025-02-06 21:33:32,Meta,META,"Pinterest shares surge as much as 20% after company beats on fourth quarter revenue, shows strong user growth","Pinterest shares surged as much as 20% after the social media company reported fourth-quarter earnings Thursday that beat on revenue.

Here’s how the company performed, according to LSEG:

* **Revenue**: $1.15 billion vs. $1.14 billion expected
* **Fourth-quarter EBIDTA, adjusted**: $470.9 million vs. $444.8 million.

Pinterest said its fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.56. That figure is not comparable to analyst estimates because the company recorded a deferred tax benefit of $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter.

Revenue for Pinterest’s fourth quarter jumped 18% year over year while net income was $1.85 billion, which included the deferred tax benefit.  

The company’s fourth-quarter adjusted EBIDTA margin was 41%, which was higher the 39% that Wall Street was projecting.

Pinterest said it expects first-quarter sales to come in between $837 million to $852 million. The midpoint of that range, $844.5 million, topped analysts’ expectations of $833 million.

The company said global monthly active users grew 11% year over year to 553 million in the fourth quarter. That was ahead of Wall Street estimates of 547.4 million. Pinterest’s fourth-quarter global average revenue per user came in at $2.12, higher than analysts’ expectations of $2.09.  
  
Pinterest’s latest global monthly active user numbers represent nearly 3% growth from 537 million in brought in during the third quarter.

“Our strategy is paying off,” Pinterest CEO Bill Ready said in a statement. “People are coming to Pinterest more often, the platform has never been more actionable, and our lower funnel focus is driving results for users and advertisers.”

Pinterest’s report comes after other social media companies saw their stock prices rise following strong results for the quarter that ended in December.

Snap shares jumped in after-hours trading on Tuesday after the social media company reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results. Last week, Meta reported fourth-quarter results that beat on the top and bottom.

2025-02-05 18:54:07,Meta,META,Thinking about NVDA beyond 2025 Hyperscaler CapEx Growth,"With 3/4 hyperscalers reporting earnings already, the reaction to Nvidia has been positive, but stock still trades less than before DeepSeek. I believe the sentiment is that while 2025 will be great, Nvidia is nearing the ""end of great times"" and moving to a ""just good times"".

**Here's my take at a breakdown. I am not an expert, but have read a lot of positive and negative takes, I'm starting this thread to start a discussion not to pump the stock. Please don't comment ""Nvidia diamond hands durr"".** I didn't use AI to write this sadly.

I can't link out to some of the resources, but tried to describe them for easy search and find.

**TLDR:** Meeting 2025 revenue projections isn't at excessive risk based on CapEx raises so far. It's likely that production capacity may really be the limiting reagent for 2025 revenues not demand. Market is forward looking and there is uncertainity on 2026+ revenues (DeepSeek is one of them) - markets don't like that. However, uncertainity is an opportunity if Nvidia can deliver again - remember stocks climb a wall of worry.

**Disclosure:** Own a lot of NVDA. But have covered calls on them, so not a blindfold risktaker.

**Personal take:** NVDA is attractive at these levels, but I'd be cautious holding my entire position after the summer 2025 earnings calls from the hyperscalers, because if there's any indication there is a 2026 CapEx slowdown, stock could fall a lot. I can't predict the future, so diversification is important even if you like the stock.

However, continued chip innovation that maintains a competitive advantage that leads to higher end customer ROIs compared to other chip alternatives would help. Also, release of one tangible AI product would change the sentiment and game here (e.g. Robotaxis, enterprise solutions used common place for F500 companies, etc). Many are already underway - my company is releasing Gemini for all employees - this goes beyond software engineers. I think diversification across the industry (AVGO, TSM, power producers) could be valuable as time progresses as the AI use case boom happens.

\-----------------------------------------

**(1) Meeting 2025 Revenue projections isn't at excessive risk based on CapEx raises so far**

Based on [stockanalysis](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/nvda/forecast/) consensus 2024 to 2025 revenue growth is estimated to be 52%.

1. MSFT: 55.7B in 2024 to 80B in 2025
2. Google: 52.5B in 2024 to 75B in 2025
3. Meta: 39B in 2024 to 60B - 60B in 2025

Based on the numbers written above, the anticipated growth from hyperscaler capex spend is 46% (if we assume concentration of NVDA chip spend as percent of capex steady). Hyperscalers are estimated to be about 50% of Nvidia revenue. To reach the 52% target that means from the remainder of the revenue book, Nvidia needs 58% spend increase.

This doesn't seem unreasonable. **Potential** investments through StarGate (Oracle), OpenAI's increasingly independent spending funded by Softbank, and sovereign AI investments are a tailwind to that figure. However, sustained export controls (e.g. Biden's global export framework) and increased crackdowns are headwinds.

**(2) It's likely that production capacity may really be the limiting reagent for 2025 revenues not demand**

Based on multiple [sources](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidias-blackwell-gpus-are-sold-out-for-the-next-12-months-chipmaker-to-gain-market-share-in-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com), seems like Blackweel is sold out for the next 12 months anyways. So 2025 revenues may be a matter of strong production. Moreover, from the commentary that google had on their earnings call - seems like cloud growth is supply constrained by infrastructure rather than demand constrained. I believe for 2025 at least customers will buy as many NVIDIA chips as they can and its production that determines valuation.

Since the market is forward looking, 2025 revenue misses won't be as crucial as addressing the question of when is the demand going to slow down and the AI semiconductor sales from NVDA slowdown?

**(3) Market is forward looking and there is uncertainity on 2026+ revenues (DeepSeek is one of them)..markets don't like that**

No matter how you slice it, DeepSeek has provided true software driven advances that more efficiently use Nvidia GPUs and non-NVDA GPUs on the training and particularly inference level. You can look at the cost per inference token for DeepSeek vs. OpenAI. It has raised questions on the sustainability on needing cutting edge chips at high margins in the long run. Risks below.

* **Do closed loop models even have a moat over open source?**: Can closed-loop/proprietary LLMs develop models that demand a strong ROI justifying investment in more chips to **train** better models that **end users are willing to pay for**? Currently Sam Altman & Dario (Antropic) think compute is the way to go. However, at some point they could discover more compute for training =/= better or more efficient models.
* **Training:** Efficiencies in hardware utilization may reduce Nvidia's moat in interconnectivity and lead to better training advances, which could reduce margins if other chips are ""somewhat as good"" eventually given demand equalizes to supply. See point # 1 in this excellent recap here  (available by searching DeepSeek and the ramification on the AI industry: winners and losers? by Rihard Jarc)
* **More use cases in a post training world could mean more inference on custom chips & competitor products:** It is widely believed that Nvidia is more of an undisputed leader in training performance vs. inference. If open source models become good enough and training investments do not result in monetizable ROI, Nvidia's margins likely fall as custom chips and other semiconductor players provide good solutions. [Jevon's Paradox (more use cases and usage)](https://www.npr.org/sections/planet-money/2025/02/04/g-s1-46018/ai-deepseek-economics-jevons-paradox) is very likely here, but volume would have to increase signficantly to offset margin decreases - a risk that the market doesn't like.
* **CUDA alternatives leads to market share loses?:** CUDA is widely known to be the best option ""coding"" platform to get GPUs to do what you want right now. [However, there are other applications coming out that allow fungible usage of other chips. ](https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/17/nvidia_cuda_moat/#:~:text=If%20you're%20doing%20low,AMD%20hardware%20%E2%80%93%20and%20vice%20versa)This reduces the need to use Nvidia chips and pay such high margins. There's drawbacks to not using CUDA that I'll highlight in section 4.

Sidenote - there is an honest and excellent podcast on DeepSeek implications to Nvidia from Bankless w/ Jeffrey Emmanuel (whose blogpost got a lot of investors interested in DeepSeek impact over 2 weekends ago). Please listen.

**(4) However, uncertainity is an opportunity if Nvidia can deliver again - remember stocks climb a wall of worry.**

* **Early innings of the AI story:** Models are going to get more complex not stagnate. This requires more training compute as we try to reach AGI level models. On the inference front, as more use cases explode, there will be more general chip demand. We haven't even seen full released use cases in robotics, autonomous transit, healthcare AI, etc.
* **CUDA is the lowest latency** and provides best performance as of now. There might be a technical limit to how well alternatives perform.
* **Cost of being last** in AI is too great for hyperscalers
* **Continued innovation leadership:** Nvidia has expedited it's semiconductor cycle from 2 years to 1 year. Rubin (next gen AI chips) are already being worked on. Semiconductors are known to be cylical, but this may dull any trough cycle.
* **Increased soverign AI investments** (StarGate, Middle east, etc.)
* **Ridiculous cash flow with minimal R&D** as % of revenue means that Nvidia can invest in strategic ventures, emerging tech, and adjacent spaces to diversify revenue streams. Not sure this is proven out in the financials yet, but could in the future.
* **Hopefully - reduced interest rates boosts stock valuations**.

2025-02-05 16:06:28,Meta,META,"Google opens its most powerful AI models to everyone, the next stage in its virtual agent push","Google on Wednesday released Gemini 2.0 — its “most capable” artificial intelligence model suite yet — to everyone.

In December, the company gave access to developers and trusted testers, as well as wrapping some features into Google products, but this is a “general release,” according to Google.

The suite of models includes 2.0 Flash, which is billed as a “workhorse model, optimal for high-volume, high-frequency tasks at scale”; 2.0 Pro Experimental, which is largely focused on coding performance; and 2.0 Flash-Lite, which Google bills as its “most cost-efficient model yet.”

Gemini Flash costs developers 10 cents per million tokens for text, image and video inputs, while Flash-Lite, its more cost-effective version, costs .75 of a cent for the same.

The continued releases are part of a broader strategy for Google of investing heavily into “AI agents” as the AI arms race heats up among tech giants and startups alike.

Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, OpenAI and Anthropic are also moving toward agentic AI, or models that can complete complex multi-step tasks on a user’s behalf, rather than a user having to walk them through every individual step.

“Over the last year, we have been investing in developing more agentic models, meaning they can understand more about the world around you, think multiple steps ahead, and take action on your behalf, with your supervision,” Google wrote in a December blog post, adding that Gemini 2.0 has “new advances in multimodality — like native image and audio output — and native tool use,” and that the family of models “will enable us to build new AI agents that bring us closer to our vision of a universal assistant.”

Anthropic, the Amazon-backed AI startup founded by ex-OpenAI research executives, is a key competitor in the race to develop AI agents. In October, the startup said that its AI agents were able to use computers like humans to complete complex tasks. Anthropic’s computer use capability allows its technology to interpret what’s on a computer screen, select buttons, enter text, navigate websites and execute tasks through any software and real-time internet browsing, the startup said.

The tool can “use computers in basically the same way that we do,” Jared Kaplan, Anthropic’s chief science officer, told CNBC in an interview at the time. He said it can do tasks with “tens or even hundreds of steps.”

OpenAI released a similar tool recently, introducing a feature called Operator that will automate tasks such as planning vacations, filling out forms, making restaurant reservations and ordering groceries. The Microsoft-backed startup described Operator as “an agent that can go to the web to perform tasks for you.”

Earlier this week, OpenAI announced another tool called Deep Research that allows an AI agent to compile complex research reports and analyze questions and topics of the user’s choice. Google in December launched a similar tool of the same name — Deep Research — which acts as a “research assistant, exploring complex topics and compiling reports on your behalf.”

CNBC first reported in December that Google would introduce several AI features early in 2025.

“In history, you don’t always need to be first but you have to execute well and really be the best in class as a product,” CEO Sundar Pichai said in a strategy meeting at the time. “I think that’s what 2025 is all about.”

2025-02-05 15:29:20,Meta,META,Meta going to surpass GOOG in market cap by EOY even though it makes no sense,"Given current trajectories in both share price and valuation, i think META will pass GOOG in market cap by EOY or mid 2026.

I'm trying to rationalize it to myself but I can't - META doesn't even make 70% as much money (net income, if we go by revenue its about 55-65%) as GOOG and their ad business is like 2/3 the size (again, going off net income).  
  
Meta makes 98% of revenues from Ads, Google made around 73% last quarter. I understand that Meta is growing faster, but its advertising business is still not even 2/3 the size of Google and they have 0 diversification outside of ads, so i don't quite understand how meta is poised to surpass google despite being a smaller player in the advertising market and also being a one trick pony.

The key difference with these two stocks imo is that GOOG trades at a discount with the p/e in terminal decline since 2022 (its at 21 today and has been monotonically decreasing for almost 3 years now), while Meta enjoys a valuation expansion on top of its increasing earnings (goog increases earnings but valuation keeps contracting).

The stock market is about telling a story. The story around Google has been completely shit for three years now (AI is eating their lunch despite net income over $100b in 2024 - more than Apple and every other company on the market!) and I don't see what will cause that narrative to improve. In fact it will probably get worse. I can see Google tripling profits between now and 2030 while the p/e is cut in half, tbh

 
Imagine telling a Google bear on the eve of November 2022 after the release of ChatGPT that Google will make 100b in net income in 2024. They'd laugh in your face - search will be obsolete by then. The jury is out on this one, generative AI is not taking marker share and not causing a growth slowdown.

We've been asking this question for almost 3 years now, the answer has remained the same, yet bears keep on thinking that will change. When do you bears lose credibility? We've been hearing about the demise of Search for almost 30 months. At what point do you just admit that you're wrong and realize that LLM is orthogonal to search?
what are peoples thoughts?


EDIT:

A commentor posted this:
""google will never have half the PE of now, it cannot trade at average SPY PE, it has too much moat to be valued like any other SPY company""

Yet look at the facts today:

Current p/e ratio of the SPY: 27.71
current p/e ratio of GOOG: 21 - so google already trades at a STEEP discount to the market. I'm looking at the P/E chart and it seems that the discount is poised to just get worse over time? Pull up the chart of GOOG P/E over time, its in terminal decline for years now. It started the decade around ~30, halfway through the decade in 2025 its at ~21, it will be 10-15 by end of the decade at this rate

why is GOOG considered ""magnificent"" (the market thinks the business is lackluster considering the steep discount it trades at)? ",939,401,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iickrt/meta_going_to_surpass_goog_in_market_cap_by_eoy/

**Ticker:** [**AMD (Advanced Micro Devices)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMD&p=d)

**Catalyst:** AMD reported EPS of $0.29 vs. $0.41 expected. Revenue of $7.66 billion vs. $7.5 billion expected. Ultimately said that data center segment revw will be down in Q1, but had clear positive outlook in 2025 and expected double digit revenue growth. This was what caused the stock to fall despite the initial spike.

**Technicals:** Watching $100 level, but doesn't seem to be an irrational move in my opinion. Note that we've moved from $150 to $107 in the past 3 months.

**Risks:** The vast majority of NVDA/AMD/every semiconductor's business's money comes from selling to businesses- individual consumers are a tiny slice of the pie despite gaming/client businesses growing, so I don't really pay attention to them (one exception is NVDA'S 50 series GPUs selling out within 5 minutes) . We also have threats from NVDA dominance, possible regulations from the US, etc, (Disclaimer: I generally don't invest in AMD)

**Related Tickers:** NVDA, INTC, QCOM

**Offhand Comments:** Overall doesn't seem to have affected NVDA or other semis much because what they cited was weakness that was exclusive to them and not the broader semis market.

**Ticker:** [**GOOG (Alphabet Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GOOG&p=d)

**Catalyst:** GOOG/GOOGL reported fourth-quarter 2024 earnings with an EPS of $2.12 vs. $2.12 expected. Revenue of $96.5 billion vs. $96.67 billion expected. Cited FAR more spending in CapEx and a miss in cloud revenue (which signals that other competitors have taken their market share)

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Market had a pretty negative reaction to the news that they'd be investing far more in capex and missed on cloud revenue (was roughly $9B vs $12B expected).

**Risks:** Elevated capital spending may pressure Alphabet's margins if the capex spending doesn't result in increased revenue, especially amidst increasing competition in the AI and cloud markets. I don't really see the China investigation to affect their stock price much, Google Search and Youtube are blocked in China and I doubt that China is going to let Waymo operate in their cities rather than creating their own solution.

**Catalyst:** The U.S. Postal Service has suspended accepting parcels from China and Hong Kong following new tariffs imposed by Trump, affecting logistics companies like UPS and FedEx.

**Technicals:** I'm mainly interested in PDD because they own Temu, which focuses on shipping small/low-cost goods to the US and using the loophole for very low shipping costs.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The recent suspension by USPS may lead to increased demand for private carriers like UPS and FedEx to handle parcels from China. There are a number of Chinese companies that focus on shipping low cost goods (like PDD).

**Risks:** Heightened tariffs and trade barriers could disrupt supply chains, increase costs, and lead to potential overreliance on private carriers, which may face capacity constraints and regulatory scrutiny.

**Technicals:** Watching $60 level, no bias.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Despite Uber's strong quarterly performance, they cited a potential $1 billion impact from a strong U.S. dollar on future bookings which results in worse earnings overseas.

**Risks:** Outside of self-driving cars (Uber partnered with Waymo to operate in Austin), currency fluctuations and international markets affect companies you wouldn't normally expect. This may move in future from tariff news.

**Catalyst:** Trump announced that the United States plans to take over the Gaza Strip, relocate its residents to neighboring countries, and redevelop the area.

**Technicals:** USO didn't move much on this piece of news, but if Trump actually makes this a policy then we might see a LOT more volatility in the future depending on how serious we get and if we get involved again.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The oil sector is sensitive to geopolitical developments in the Middle East, a region critical to global oil supply. Initial market reactions to Trump's Gaza proposal didn't impact oil prices. Not really a catalyst TODAY but worth thinking about in the future.

**Risks:** Potential escalation of regional tensions could disrupt oil production or transportation, leading to supply constraints and increased volatility in oil prices.

CapEx is being funneled into GPUs, networking, and AI-specific chips. This should make NVIDIA the biggest winner of this trend.

Also, OpenAI just introduced a new ""Deep Research"" AI model, designed for long-context reasoning. This will require even more compute power, further straining existing AI infrastructure. More power demand = more GPUs, networking gear, and data centers.

As long as AI models grow in complexity and scale, NVIDIA and AI infrastructure players should benefit. 

Even if Deepseek story was accurate, optimized model like Deepseek's will drive more demand, which will need even more powerful servers.

All the cases for yet another great year for chip makers especially NVIDIA, don't you think?",39,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ihzo1s/big_tech_capex_2024_vs_2025_and_increase_in_ai/
2025-02-04 23:07:55,Meta,META,"AMD reports profit beat, but misses on data center revenue","Advanced Micro Devices reported fourth-quarter results on Tuesday that beat Wall Street expectations for sales and earnings, but the stock fell about 6% in extended trading as the company missed estimates in its key data center segment.

Here’s how the chipmaker did, versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ended Dec. 28:

Earnings per share: $1.09, adjusted, versus $1.08 expected

Revenue: $7.66 billion versus $7.53 billion

AMD said it expects $7.1 billion in sales in the first quarter, plus or minus $300 million. It projected its gross margin to be about 54%. Analysts expected AMD to guide for revenue of $7 billion.

AMD reported $482 million in net income, or 29 cents per share, for the fourth quarter, down from $667 million, or 41 cents per share in the year-ago period.The company’s adjusted earnings per share excluded items such as acquisition costs, inventory loss at contract manufacturers, and restructuring charges.

Su told investors on an earnings call that AMD believes it will report “strong double-digit percentage revenue and EPS growth” in 2025.

The company’s most important unit is its business selling chips for data centers, which has been growing in recent quarters, thanks to demand for its graphics processing units for artificial intelligence.

AMD reported $3.86 billion in data center sales, which was up 69% on a year-over-year basis. The company said the increase was due to sales both in its Instinct GPUs and its EPYC CPUs, which compete with Intel’s processors.

However, analysts polled by FactSet were predicting $4.14 billion in data center sales during the quarter.

For the full year, AMD’s data center division revenue increased 94% to $12.6 billion. AMD said that $5 billion of those sales were from its Instinct GPUs for AI.

While AMD is far behind market leader Nvidia, it’s released competitive data center GPUs in recent years such as the MI300X, that some big infrastructure buyers, including Meta and Amazon, have embraced.

“We believe this places AMD on a steep long-term growth trajectory, led by the rapid scaling of our data center AI franchise from more than $5 billion of revenue in 2024 to tens of billions of dollars of annual revenue over the coming years,” Su said on the earnings call with analysts.

AMD categorizes its chips for PCs, laptops, and other individual computers as client revenue, which increased 58% on an annual basis to $2.3 billion. AMD said both its chips for desktops as well as mobile computers such as laptops are seeing strong demand.

AMD is also the second-largest producer of GPUs for gaming, behind Nvidia. Revenue in the segment declined 59% to $563 million. The company’s other small division, embedded chips, reported $923 million in sales, down 13% year-over-year.

2025-01-31 22:23:01,Meta,META,"Speculation - walled garden platforms are the future, where to invest if so?","Given the dramatic rise of generative AI, I'm expecting the open web to become less and less useful, and not a place where people spend time.

Instead, I'm predicting a solid uptick in ""walled gardens. Platforms that create space for communities to exist and are - either passively through logins or aggressively through moderation and other tools - limiting access to generative content, providing opportunities for genuine connection, valuing high-quality contributors etc.

Now I'd be interested to hear what people think about this thesis, and if you buy into it then how and where you'd invest to profit from the momentum.

Meta is one example of a walled garden, but from their corporate strategy and my personal experience, they're going in the opposite direction and their apps are more and more full of generative AI content.

Slack and Discord are other examples and often used for community building, but the former is part of Salesforce and the latter is still private.

What other investment opportunities are there that would benefit from this (theorised) shift from an open to closed web?

The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

Catalyst I'm looking out for today- NVDA CEO to meet with White House officials, and server capex cost for DeepSeek estimated to be almost $1.3B. Deepseek capabilities are expected to be copied by US firms.

News: [Fed's Favored Inflation Gauge Posted Muted Advance In December](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-31/fed-s-favored-inflation-gauge-posted-muted-advance-in-december)

Ticker: [AAPL (Apple Inc.)](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)

Catalyst: Apple reported EPS of $2.40 vs. $2.35, and revenue of $124.3B vs 124B.

Despite these positive results, the company provided cautious guidance for the upcoming quarter, citing uncertainties related to the impact of new AI features on sales. Tim Cook mentioned that Apple Intelligence DID lead to stronger sales/growth in areas where it was rolled out (it has limited rollout right now).

Volume/Market Cap/Technicals: Watching $250 level, no strong bias. We've seen AAPL swing close to 20% this month, (on report of sales weakness in China) but doubt this will continue.

Context: Most immediate news that comes to mind was the weakness of sales in China for the iPhone, causing the move this month.

Risks: Don't really see immediate risks beyond the trade war, in 2019/2020 this resulted in AAPL moving manufacturing/production to other countries in South East Asia- slowing growth in China has been pretty consistent, however.

Related Tickers: rest of FAANG, Samsung if you can trade overseas stocks, the various phone component manufacturers that trade with AAPL

Offhand: Apple is investing in its own high-speed network infrastructure to enhance content delivery, (just like META's undersea pipeline)

Ticker: [ACMR (ACM Research, Inc.)](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ACMR&p=d)

Catalyst: Kerrisdale Capital released a bullish report on ACM Research (ACMR), a semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment (WFE) company positioned in China but headquartered in America.

It leads China as a leading supplier of wafer cleaning tools and beneficiary of China's push toward semiconductor self-sufficiency.

Kerrisdale predicts the company to eventually compete globally and cites it as a potential 10x return. Trades at 1x 2025E revenue (likely due to China fears).

Volume/Market Cap/Technicals: This is the interesting part- ACMR holds a $1.2B mkt cap but trades at a massive discount compared to its Chinese subsidiary (ACMS), which has a $5.9 billion market cap and trades at 6x 2025E revenue.

The report suggests that ACMR’s NASDAQ valuation is severely mispriced and could re-rate significantly as investors recognize the valuation gap.

Context: China/US chip war, you guys know what this is.

Sector Context: The global semiconductor industry is shifting, with China attempting to localize chip production.

Kerrisdale argues that restrictions on U.S. and Japanese WFE exports to China will only fuel ACMR’s growth as Chinese fabs increasingly turn to domestic suppliers.

China's WFE self-sufficiency has grown from 4% in 2019 to 17% in 2024 and is expected to reach 36% by 2026.

Risks: Geopolitical factors, including further U.S. export restrictions, could impact ACMR’s operations. Similar to how we have the NVDA trade restriction going on right now. However, Kerrisdale sees these restrictions as a net positive due to ACMR having less competition in China as a result. There are other players in the WFE space in China, but ACMR has a technological moat.

Ticker: [INTC](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=INTC&p=d)

Catalyst: Intel reported revenue of $14.26B vs exp of $13.81B. Most important, the company anticipated breakeven EPS next quarter.

Volume/Market Cap/Technicals: Somewhat rangebound for the past 3 months. Watching $20 but nothing interesting I'm watching beyond that.

Context: This earnings report is Intel's first since the departure of CEO Pat Gelsinger. Right now INTC is being led by two interim co-CEOs, and another price catalyst that could potentially happen is someone competent being picked lol. Also worth thinking of the NVDA/Deepseek/semiconductor news when reading through these catalysts.

Intel has also announced a delay in its Falcon Shores GPU and only using it internally within the company.

Risks: Intel faces significant competition from companies such as NVIDIA and AMD, the delay of their chip is pretty bad news.

Related Tickers: AMD/NVDA/TSM

Ticker: [ASTS](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASTS&p=d)

Catalyst: ASTS has received special temporary authority from the FCC to test its space-based cellular broadband network in the United States. Allows for collaboration efforts with VZ/T.

Volume/Market Cap/Technicals: Slight rise, but will watch this at open to see if volume comes in.

Context: The FCC's authorization allows ASTS to provide cell/satellite comms, allowing for greater coverage and signals that more use of ASTS satellites. I remember that the company was essentially valued based on each satellite they launched successfully in 2024, whether that hype returns remains to be seen but overall not interested in trading this unless we have retail interest again.

Sector Context: SpaceX's Starlink is also entering the direct-to-cell market, as I noted a few days ago- most of the investment that can be done in these type of cell/sat comms in public markets can really only be done in ASTS.

Risks: If SpaceX IPOs we might see a selloff in this stock simply because SpaceX is far larger/established and Elon Musk has closer ties to the government.

The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

**Today OpenAI may make history. Trying out longer form, more detailed catalyst examinations over the short-form with more tickers.**

**Ticker:** [**META (Meta Inc)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=META&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Reported earnings of $8.02 vs $6.68 expected. Revenue of $48.4B vs $47B,but guided revenue short of consensus and didn't provide FY25 revenue outlook (which triggered the reason for the selloff post-earnings after the close).

Their CAPEX announcement was $60-65B vs $52.4B expected, and stated they expected the single largest driver of expesive growth in 2025 as infrastructure costs due to higher OpEX and depreciation.

Also announced plans to grow META's AI team significantly.

**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** Earnings move the stock on far less volume but the initial selloff after announcement was worth trading- interested in the $700 level today but not much beyond that.

**Context:** Decent earnings but signals that there is more spending on the horizon- likely that the initial brutal selloff to $606 was from algos just reading the initial eye-popping CAPEX number and selling the company.

**Sector Context:**There is a major next-level breakthrough that OpenAI is expected to release today that has agents performing on the same level as PHDs, Altman is meeting today with US government officials. META is the creator of Llama, which is another open source model compared to OpenAI's closed models.

**Risks:** Deepseek has been the main threat involved, with competitors from China using distillation and other AI techniques to be able to train a far cheaper model that brings up the question of why our large tech firms are spending so much on GPUs. (I'm sure this is news to you /s)

**Related Tickers:** FAANG stocks, SNAP, PINS, etc.

Offhand:  Something worth remembering is that there is a $10B undersea cable that spans over 40K km that they plan to build (unknown what the cable is for), more details coming in 2025. Likely some kind of fiber optic cable.

**Ticker:** [**TSLA (Tesla Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Reported earnings of $0.73 vs $0.76 expected. Revenue of $25.71B vs $27.23B expected. Most of this revenue miss came from miss in sale of EVs. 

TSLA announced interesting plans to lower the price of EVs in 2025 but also didn't give specific details regarding the production volume targets (as they have in the past), and also announced that there would be a paid robotaxi service in Austin in June. This puts them in competition with Waymo/UBER. Personally I think the vision-only approach is not viable in the long-run but hey, I'm no self-driving PHD. 

CAPEX was ALSO higher as with META due to spending increases from AI training infra costs and battery production capacity.

**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** I'm mainly interested in the $375/$400 level, not too interested in going long despite the multi-day slide in price.

**Context:** Main reason for TSLA's selloff was the lack of full-year guidance (it gives the subtext that it's too bad to release publically or it's up in the air). Political statements made by Musk may contribute to future issues for TSLA.

**Sector Context:** Revenue shortfall was caused due to lower-than-expected vehicle deliveries/ increased sale incentives, 496K cars vs 507K exp. China's BYD is rapidly catching up, and the (possible) removal of the US EV tax credit may make EV's more expensive

**Risks:** Mainly geopolitical- if the tariffs on EV vehicles imported to the US gets removed, TSLA will face fiercer competition from BYD. Also Elon Musk.

**Related Tickers:** BYD (but mainly trades in China, TSLA isn't as impacted by AI news.)



[**NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation) (in addition to ARM/AMD/SMH/SOXL/semiconductor stocks)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** The reveal of Deepseek has introduced an AI model that rivals existing solutions but was developed at around $6M. However there's a rumor that Deepseek is actually trained on 50K H100 NVDA gpus.

**Yesterday after the close, there was an announcement Trump officials discussing tightening curbs on Nvidia's China sales.**

**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** Overall, there's been a massive selloff since NVDA was $150 at the end of last week. Overall interested again if we hit $116, but low confidence we'll sell off again. 

Currently long.

**Sector Context:** Not much to really say about this beyond NVDA having the most advanced chips that are widespread for training because of the CUDA architecture- most people are doubtful that the TOTAL cost was $6M

US Officials are examining export restrictions but China will likely find a way to bypass them as they have previously.

**Risks:** Mainly geopolitical, again. Obviously it's very difficult to restrict trade to a country that we have no military presence in or surround, and China is economically far more powerful than those we have attempted trade restrictions on in the past.

# [S&P 500 futures rise after Meta Platforms, Tesla report earnings: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/29/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> S&P 500 futures rose Thursday as Wall Street digested recent quarterly results from a slew of megacap tech companies. Investors are coming off a losing session after the Federal Reserve held steady on rates.
*****
> Futures tied to the broad market index added 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.5%. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were fractionally lower.
*****
> Shares of Meta Platforms and Tesla gained 1% and 2%, respectively, while Microsoft shares dipped more than 4% after the companies reported earnings. Meta beat on top and bottom lines, but Microsoft shares faltered after the company’s quarterly revenue forecast disappointed. Tesla shrugged off an earnings and revenue miss. On the other hand, revenue misses from UPS and Caterpillar weighed the indexes down.
*****
> Other “Magnificent Seven” names are set to report in the coming days, with Apple’s results being due for a Thursday release. Amazon will soon follow suit, as the megacap tech company reports next week.
*****
> On Wednesday, all three major averages ended the session lower as a 4% decline in Nvidia weighed on the market. The declines came after the Fed paused its interest rate-cutting campaign, leaving its borrowing rate unchanged in a range between 4.25% and 4.5%. In their post-meeting statement, policymakers noted that inflation remains “somewhat elevated.”
*****
> “The implication is that we’re on hold until the inflation rate goes down, and unfortunately it’s probably not going to go down very much in the several months ahead, so I wouldn’t be looking for rate cuts at the next meeting,” Jeffrey Gundlach, DoubleLine Capital CEO, said Wednesday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.”
*****
> “We have a relatively stable place where we’re standing, and it kind of supports the fact that the market is in a calm position right now, and so is [Jerome] Powell apparently,” he said.
*****
> On the economic data front, the fourth-quarter gross domestic product reading is due on Thursday, and weekly jobless claims are out in the morning. Investors are also looking ahead to Friday’s personal consumption expenditures price index report for December.

[Meta](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/META/) shares were flat after the company reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat on the top and bottom.

Here’s how the company did, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share**: $8.02 vs. $6.77
* **Revenue**: $48.39 billion vs. $47.04 billion

On a call with analysts, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg explained some of the rationale for the company’s recent efforts to [improve its relationship](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/11/meta-had-to-bend-the-knee-to-trump-ahead-of-inauguration.html) with President Donald Trump and the current White House administration.

“We now have a US administration that is proud of our leading companies, prioritizes American technology winning, and that will defend our values and interests abroad, and I am optimistic about the progress and innovation that this can unlock,” Zuckerberg said. “So this is going to be a big year.”

Meta said its first-quarter revenue would be in the range of $39.5 billion to $41.8 billion. The midpoint of that figure trailed analysts’ expectations of first-quarter revenue of $41.73 billion.

Meta’s fourth-quarter sales grew 21% year over year while its net income was $20.84.

The company said that daily active people came in at 3.35 billion in the quarter, up from 3.29 billion the previous quarter. Wall Street was projecting 3.32 billion for the fourth quarter.

Meta said that its first quarter costs and [expenses](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/24/zuckerberg-sets-metas-ai-targets-for-the-year-expects-to-spend-60-billion-on-growth.html) were $25.02 billion, representing a more than 5% increase from the prior year.

Meta reiterated last Friday’s announcement that it would invest between $60 billion and $65 billion in capital expenditures in 2025 to fuel its AI strategy.

Meta did not provide a revenue outlook for 2025, but investments in the company’s core business “will give us an opportunity to continue delivering strong revenue growth throughout 2025,” finance chief Susan Li said in a statement.

The company expects its total expenses for 2025 to come in between $114 billion to $119 billion, with the bulk of the spending related to its infrastructure costs, Meta said. The company plans to hire workers for infrastructure, monetization, Reality Labs, generative artificial intelligence, regulation and compliance.

# [Stock futures are little changed as investors await Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/28/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures were near the flatline on Wednesday as investors turned toward the first Federal Reserve interest rate decision of 2025.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched down 13 points. Nasdaq 100 futures were 0.3% higher, while S&P 500 futures was trading around the flatline.
*****
> Tech stocks on Tuesday led the S&P 500 higher and brought the Nasdaq Composite to a 2% gain. The two indexes made a comeback after incurring sharp losses on Monday in a sell-off spurred by the emergence of China’s DeepSeek and the threat it poses to the artificial intelligence trade. Nvidia, which suffered a roughly 17% decline Monday, jumped nearly 9% on Tuesday.
*****
> “As far as the DeepSeek news over the weekend, at the end of the day today, there really hasn’t been that much of an impact on a market-wide basis,” Bespoke Investment Group co-founder Paul Hickey said Tuesday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.”
*****
> The Fed’s interest rate decision on Wednesday is now a focal point for investors, as well as Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference. Fed funds futures data reflect a nearly 100% certainty that the central bank will keep rates steady at a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, according to CME Group data.
*****
> “When it comes to the Fed, they’re widely not expected to do anything tomorrow and that’s a good thing. The less the Fed has to do, the better it is for the market, in our view,” Hickey added.
*****
> Investors will be paying especially close attention to Powell’s comments — his first press conference in President Donald Trump’s second term. The two have had a contentious relationship dating back to Trump’s first term. The president has already said he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”
*****
> A volley of Big Tech earnings are due Wednesday afternoon, with Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Tesla issuing their quarterly reports.

*****
> S&P 500 futures were relatively unchanged early Tuesday, following a sell-off fueled by worries over the emergence of Chinese startup DeepSeek and its greater implications for the artificial intelligence trade.
*****
> Futures tied to the S&P 500, along with Nasdaq 100 futures, traded just above the flatline, rising 0.1%. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were also flat.
*****
> Futures were trading in step with Nvidia in the premarket, with both trading off their highs during the session. Nvidia added around 2% after suffering a nearly 17% decline on Monday, which resulted in a market cap loss of nearly $600 billion — the biggest one-day drop for a U.S. company in history. Broadcom and Oracle also traded higher by more than 2% and around 1%, respectively.
*****
> Concerns over DeepSeek came to a head on Monday, with the Nasdaq Composite losing more than 3%, while the S&P 500 slid about 1.5%. The Chinese startup last month unveiled a free open-source large language model that it says took less than $6 million to build. The development spurred worries around Big Tech’s investment into AI. DeepSeek surpassed rival OpenAI on Monday to become the most-downloaded free app in the U.S. on Apple’s App Store.
*****
> “Valuations remain extended, and while vulnerabilities were expected this year, developments like DeepSeek highlight the need for diversification beyond the Mag Seven,” said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. “The 2025 theme of US exceptionalism is now facing uncertainty, with ongoing concerns around tariffs and inflation adding to market challenges.”

Fed funds futures are pricing in a more than 99% chance that interest rates will remain unchanged, according to CMEGroup’s FedWatch Tool.

2025-01-28 05:21:43,Meta,META,META & MSFT Earnings in Deep Doo Doo?,"Coming off the market reaction yesterday to DeepSeek and the questions investors have about the future of AI stock valuations, how do people see earnings playing out for big AI spenders MSFT and META?

Both companies announced big CAPEX spend related to AI for the coming year 2025. Regardless if the amount spent on DeepSeek is true or not, the narrative seems to be that AI may not need as much money as originally thought. 

Both companies' stock were hit in the short term in the past on their plans for big AI spending. These are both good companies but since their earnings are juxtaposed to this risk-off market reaction to DeepSeek, can earnings be positive for MSFT and META?

2025-01-27 21:16:38,Meta,META,"Nvidia sheds almost $600 billion in market cap, biggest one-day loss in U.S. history","Nvidia lost close to $600 billion in market cap on Monday, the biggest drop for any company on a single day in U.S. history.

The chipmaker’s stock price plummeted 17% to close at $118.58. It was Nvidia’s worst day on the market since March 16, 2020, which was early in the Covid pandemic. After surpassing Apple last week to become the most valuable publicly traded company, Nvidia’s drop on Monday led a 3.1% slide in the tech-heavy Nasdaq.

The selloff was sparked by concerns that Chinese artificial intelligence lab DeepSeek is presenting increased competition in the global AI battle. Late last month, DeepSeek unveiled a free, open-source large language model that it says took only two months and less than $6 million to build, using reduced-capability chips from Nvidia, called H800s. 

Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) dominate the market for AI data center chips in the U.S., with tech giants like Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon spending billions of dollars on the processors to train and run their AI models. Analysts at Cantor wrote in a report on Monday that the release of DeepSeek’s latest technology has caused “great angst as to the impact for compute demand, and therefore, fears of peak spending on GPUs.”

The analysts, who recommend buying Nvidia shares, said they “think this view is farthest from the truth,” and that advancements in AI will most likely lead to “the AI industry wanting more compute, not less.”

But after Nvidia’s huge run-up — the stock soared 239% in 2023 and 171% last year — the market is on edge about any possible pullback in spending. Broadcom, the other big U.S. chipmaker to see giant valuation gains from AI, fell 17% on Monday, pulling its market cap down by $200 billion.

Data center companies reliant on Nvidia’s GPUs for their hardware sales saw big selloffs as well. Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Super Micro Computer dropped at least 5.8%. Oracle, a part of President Donald Trump’s latest AI initiative, fell 14%.

For Nvidia, the loss was more than double the $279 billion drop the company saw in September, which was the biggest one-day market value loss in history at the time, unseating Meta’s $232 billion loss in 2022. Before that, the steepest drop was $182 billion by Apple in 2020.

Nvidia’s decline is more than double the market cap of Coca-Cola and Chevron and exceeds the market value of both Oracle and Netflix.

CEO Jensen Huang’s net worth also took a massive hit, declining roughly $21 billion, according to Forbes’ real-time billionaires list. The move demoted Huang to 17th on the richest-person list.

The sudden excitement around DeepSeek over the weekend pushed its app past OpenAI’s ChatGPT as the most-downloaded free app in the U.S. on Apple’s App Store. The model’s development comes despite a slew of recent curbs on U.S. chip exports to China.

Venture capitalist David Sacks, who was tapped by Trump to be the White House’s AI and crypto czar, wrote on X that DeepSeek’s model “shows that the AI race will be very competitive” and that Trump was right to rescind President Joe Biden’s executive order last week on AI safety.

“I’m confident in the U.S. but we can’t be complacent,” Sacks wrote.

Nvidia is now the third most-valuable public company, behind Apple and Microsoft.

DeepSeek, an AI startup just over a year old, stirred awe and consternation in Silicon Valley with its breakthrough artificial intelligence model that offered comparable performance to the world’s best chatbots at seemingly a fraction of the cost.

DeepSeek Shakes Up Stocks as Traders Fear for US Tech Leadership",">Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek rocked global technology stocks Monday, raising questions over America’s technological dominance.

>Buzz grew over the weekend about DeepSeek’s latest AI model being cost-effective while running on reduced-capability chips, casting doubt on the validity of the sky-high valuations for companies like Nvidia Corp. The Chinese firm’s product, released last week, is now at the top of Apple Inc.’s App Store rankings.

>“DeepSeek shows that it is possible to develop powerful AI models that cost less,” said Vey-Sern Ling, managing director at Union Bancaire Privee. “It can potentially derail the investment case for the entire AI supply chain, which is driven by high spending from a small handful of hyperscalers.”

>Founded by quant fund founder Liang Wenfeng, the app’s underlying AI model is widely seen as competitive with OpenAI and Meta Platforms Inc.’s latest. Lauded by investor Marc Andreessen as “one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs,” DeepSeek’s assistant shows its work and reasoning as it addresses a user’s written query or prompt. Reviews on Apple’s app store and on Alphabet Inc.’s Android Play Store praised that transparency.

>Nasdaq 100 futures tumbled as much as 1.9%, while contracts on the S&P 500 fell as much as 1%. The moves represent continued losses from Friday’s cash session, as US shares cooled after gains earlier in the week as President Donald Trump took office.

>In contrast, stocks advanced in Hong Kong, with the Hang Seng Tech Index climbing as much as 2% ahead of Lunar New Year holidays this week. Chinese AI-related stocks including Merit Interactive Co. surged by their daily limits. Merit is among those with the clearest links to DeepSeek after stating in an earlier filing that it had incorporated the homegrown AI firm’s model into marketing.

>Meanwhile, shares in the AI supply chain slumped as investors rethink their assumptions that the most advanced AI will require increasing amounts of computing power and energy. Major Nvidia supplier Advantest Corp., slid as much as 8.6% in Tokyo. Data centers shares also slipped, with Singapore-listed Mapletree Industrial Trust down 3.6%. Markets were closed for holidays in Taiwan and South Korea.

>The DeepSeek product “is deeply problematic for the thesis that the significant capital expenditure and operating expenses that Silicon Valley has incurred is the most appropriate way to approach the AI trend,’ said Nirgunan Tiruchelvam, head of consumer and internet at Singapore-based Aletheia Capital. “It calls into question the massive resources that have been dedicated to AI.”

>Kyle Rodda, senior market analyst at Capital.com, says the updated AI model unveiled by China’s DeepSeek raises concerns about geopolitical risks as well as questions about US tech stock valuations.

>The decline in Nasdaq futures comes at the start of a big week for earnings from major tech companies including Apple and Microsoft Corp. Profit growth is expected to have slowed while valuations remain inflated, once again causing concern over the large AI-driven rally in the sector.

>The Nasdaq 100 is trading at 27 estimated forward earnings, compared with its three-year average of 24 times. Nvidia is at 33 times, though that’s slightly down from its three-year average. Shares of Nvidia were more than 3% lower on the alternative trading system Blue Ocean in Asia morning, according to Kok Hoong Wong, head of institutional equities sales trading at Maybank Securities

>The DeepSeek release raises new doubts, challenging the notion that China’s AI technology is years behind US counterparts. Washington’s trade restrictions had kept the most cutting-edge chips out of China’s hands, but DeepSeek’s model was built using open source technology that is easy to access.

>“While current leaders like Nvidia have a strong foothold, it is a reminder that AI dominance cannot be taken for granted,” said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Markets. “The emergence of China’s DeepSeek indicates that competition is intensifying, and although it may not pose a significant threat now, future competitors will evolve faster and challenge the established companies more quickly. Earnings this week will be a huge test.”

2025-01-26 19:47:36,Meta,META,S&P500 vs individual stocks,"Hi all,
Apologies for the maybe stupid question.

I have started investing about 1 year ago almost all of it (if not all) into well diversified ETFs like SXR8 and SPYY (yes, I know they overlap but I wanted to make it a little bit more USA heavy).

Now, I have really been wanting to invest into stocks and, of course, do the due diligence of learning about it. As I am still on the basics I can't help myself but ask, even long term, is SPY a better bet than, let's say, AAPL?
I understand that sometimes picking the ""good"" stock is difficult, but even 10 years ago Apple was among the companies with the highest market cap and still managed to outperform the index.

So I have 2 stupid questions based on this:
1. In your opinion, might this continue to happen in the future? Not necessarily apple but alphabet, Microsoft, nvidia or Meta are safer bets than Spy?
2. What are your recommendations on where to learn about investing into individual stocks, not say trading but more middle term (I believe it's called swing trading?)

Thanks in advance!",26,41,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iaoa6o/sp500_vs_individual_stocks/
2025-01-26 18:27:18,Meta,META,"Apple Remains a Threat in AR, Even as Meta and Google Race Ahead",">Meta and Google have jumped out ahead in the race to make augmented reality glasses for consumers, but Apple remains a looming threat. Also: The iPhone maker brings in a fixer for its Siri and AI efforts, and the company has a decision to make about its longtime chairman. Samsung, meanwhile, just unveiled impressive new AI features and is poised to beat Apple to market with a skinny smartphone.

>A decade ago, it began developing AR technology for its now-defunct attempt to build a self-driving vehicle. The idea: a windshield that could overlay navigation information, traffic alerts, camera feeds and other data while the car drove around town on its own. Apple even built a simulator of the concept at its Silicon Valley offices and managed to turn the idea into a working prototype that showed promise to executives.

>But the company quickly realized that this Minority Report-like experience would be too power-hungry and expensive to put inside of a vehicle. So it turned its attention to headsets, which can provide the same data in a smaller package. A person in the car could simply wear some headgear instead of needing to have the technology built into the windshield.

>The car glasses idea didn’t get too far either. But Apple’s vehicle group poured resources into developing AR displays and used virtual reality goggles to demonstrate the car’s capabilities. That ultimately led to Apple’s work on a consumer headset.

>At the time, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook felt that VR goggles were too isolating. He preferred AR, which keeps users in the real world while superimposing data on their field of vision. But it was also clear that the true AR dream — a lightweight pair of glasses that customers could wear all day — was still far off.

>That’s about the time when Mike Rockwell stepped in. That executive, who currently oversees Apple’s Vision Pro division, moved the AR and VR efforts into a team that was separate from the car unit. Rockwell and his staff spent the better part of two years creating a headset prototype that melded VR and AR into an approach that Apple eventually called spatial computing.

>This was the great compromise: Users weren’t truly seeing the real world around them, but the device’s pass-through cameras made it feel like they were. The project was greenlit, and the company eventually spent billions of dollars to develop the device — all while continuing to work on making true AR glasses a reality. That led to the release of the Vision Pro mixed-reality headset a year ago.

>Apple had originally hoped to release AR spectacles as a follow-up to the Vision Pro, but the technical challenges were just too great. Such a product remains far away, and the company is still tinkering with the underlying technologies.

>At the same time, rivals like Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google have jumped ahead in the AR race. Meta showed off a prototype of augmented reality glasses last year, and Google is working with Samsung Electronics Co. on their own next-generation devices. Meta also has had success with its Ray-Ban smart glasses, which don’t have a display but can handle tasks like recording video and making phone calls.

>The Vision Pro, meanwhile, has largely been a flop, hurt by its cumbersome design and $3,500 price tag. That said, it’s hard to discount Apple’s innovation abilities. Work on the AR screens remains ongoing at a secretive facility in Santa Clara, California, one town over from the company’s home base in Cupertino.

>Though there were layoffs at the site last year — when Apple scrapped plans for in-house smartwatch displays — the company kept some employees around to work on AR technology, along with a manufacturing facility to develop and test future screens.

>Tepid demand for the Vision Pro has only made Apple more certain that AR glasses are a superior format. But the executives involved in the effort don’t think a product will be ready for three years or more. In the meantime, Apple expects to release other devices in the style of Vision Pro that it hopes will be cheaper and more enticing to consumers.

>While it develops the AR technology for future devices, the company is conducting user studies at its offices to gauge the appeal of features and interfaces. Apple is already working on a version of visionOS — the Vision Pro’s software — that will run on glasses. It’s also exploring other types of wearable products, including a rival to Meta’s Ray-Ban spectacles and even camera-equipped AirPods.

>The question now is whether Apple’s rivals are getting too far ahead. Meta’s AR prototype, called Orion, will set the stage for a consumer product by 2027. And Google’s new Android XR operating system is meant to usher in a wave of headsets and glasses, with Samsung first in line to release devices.

>When I first tested Android XR in December at Google’s headquarters, the company showed me several glasses prototypes — with and without displays. They seemed polished for prototypes, but they won’t hit the market until the display technology improves and costs come down. Another issue to be solved: battery life.

>Meta, Google and Samsung also aren’t slowing down on development of VR and mixed-reality devices. Meta is working on Quest 4 VR goggles, as well as a new high-end model that could eventually become a successor to the Quest Pro mixed-reality headset, I’m told. Samsung, meanwhile, showed off the hardware for its “Moohan” mixed-reality headset during its Unpacked event this past week.

>In interviews, Samsung and Google executives hinted that this headset would be cheaper than the Vision Pro and that it’s on track to debut this year. The companies won’t have to share the spotlight with Apple, which is unlikely to ship any major new head-worn device in 2025.

>But the real showdown will come in the years ahead, when AR glasses are refined enough to serve as a smartphone replacement. You can imagine a future where people use smart spectacles as their primary mobile device and then turn to a mixed-reality or VR headset for gaming or computing tasks. In that vision, head-worn devices will have supplanted both phones and laptops — markets worth hundreds of billions of dollars.

>Given what’s at stake, Apple can’t afford to stay on the sidelines too long. But the company does have a history of swooping into already-established markets and beating competitors with better design and more elegantly integrated hardware and software. The playbook it used so effectively in smartphones and watches could work again.

>

>Under the deal being negotiated by the White House, TikTok's China-based owner, ByteDance, would retain a minority stake in the company, but the app's algorithm, data collection and software updates would be overseen by Oracle, which already provides the foundation of TikTok's Web infrastructure, NPR reported.

>

>The NPR report cited two people with knowledge of the talks. The White House and Oracle had no immediate comment.

>

>Trump, after taking office a day later, signed an executive order seeking to delay by 75 days the enforcement of the law that was put in place after U.S. officials warned that under ByteDance, there was a risk of Americans' data being misused.

>

>The possible deal reported by NPR would mean that American investors would own a majority stake in TikTok. However, the report added that the terms of the deal could change and are still being hammered out.

>

>""The goal is for Oracle to effectively monitor and provide oversight with what is going on with TikTok,"" a person directly involved in the talks but not authorized to speak publicly was quoted as saying by NPR.

**Thoughts:** There are a TON of entities/people who have been rumored to buy Tik Tok (off the top of my head I can list Elon Musk, META, Kevin O' Leary, Mr. Beast and an assortment of random PE firms, Perplexity AI, and now Larry Ellison/ORCL)- I assume that these entities and affiliated companies may be worth looking at and possibly taking a short position in if they've reacted strongly to Tiktok acquisition rumors in the past.

2025-01-19 19:41:26,Meta,META,"Apple Is Unlikely to Buy Sonos, But Amazon or Spotify Might Consider It",">The woes of speaker maker Sonos have raised the prospect of a takeover, but who might want to buy it? 

>

>For months, Sonos Inc. has been reeling. After a disastrous software rollout last year, the audio technology company that some used to call “the Apple of speakers” remains mired in the biggest crisis in its two-decade history.

>

>It all started in May when the company introduced a revamped app — the software that lets customers control their speakers, soundbars, subwoofers, headphones and other devices. The app was designed to modernize the Sonos experience and lay the groundwork for new types of products, such as the Ace headphones. But it lacked vital features and was hobbled by bugs, turning the simple act of using Sonos equipment into a nightmare.

>

>The missing features — including the sleep timer, advanced music queues, alarms, and functions related to searching and navigating music libraries — have mostly been restored. But users have reported that glitches persist in some cases: Devices don’t pair, audio volume will spike without warning, connections fail, and streaming doesn’t always go smoothly.

>

>Sonos should have never launched the new app the way it did and was aware of many bugs prior to the initial release. It should have kept around the old and reliable S2 app and launched the new version as a beta test. Once the revamped software became as dependable as the old app, Sonos could have moved forward with the new version as the default. Of course, that would have provided less of a splashy marketing opportunity — the chance to flip the switch on a whole new experience.

>

>So here we are. The new app ended up being devastating to employee morale, company revenue and the brand’s reputation. It’s a disaster on par with Apple’s rocky move to its own Maps software from Google in 2012 — a switch that led to the ouster of the company’s software chief. The big difference is that, for Apple, Maps is one app. For Sonos, the change compromised the software underpinning all its products.

>

>Sonos’ board ultimately needed to take action. More than six months after the launch of the app — and even after an apology tour from its executives and a multitude of attempted fixes — the company parted ways with Chief Executive Officer Patrick Spence a week ago. The next day, it also cut loose its chief product officer, who many Sonos employees blamed for the app mess.

>

>In their place is interim CEO Tom Conrad, a co-creator of music streaming service Pandora and former executive at Snap Inc. He has served on the Sonos board since 2017 and was already helping with the app recovery effort. Though the company has vowed to search the globe for a new full-time CEO, many Sonos staffers believe Conrad has the inside track to get the job — if he wants it.

>

>But with Sonos’ market valuation hovering around $1.7 billion — down from more than $5 billion during a pandemic-fueled rally — the board will probably consider whether selling the company makes more sense.

>

>Apple has long been seen as a potential suitor, given the two companies’ similarities. Sonos is focused on premium design with a tightly controlled ecosystem — just like Apple. They share a penchant for audio technology, and their corporate cultures have some overlap.

>

>Apple could snap up Sonos for $2 billion or so — less than it paid for Beats — and it would only cost them a few days’ worth of revenue. Sonos’ hardware could also shore up Apple’s disappointing HomePod and home audio lineup.

>

>But I don’t believe Apple will ever acquire Sonos. If Apple really wanted to build out its home audio business, it already has the hardware, software, content and manufacturing chops internally. It’s just about wanting to get things done properly — something that Apple is already working on. Later this year, it will launch its own home hub and a new HomePod mini.

>

>The only things it would gain from Sonos are a user base, a collection of patents and the employees — none of which Apple needs. Sonos’ software is obviously something Apple wouldn’t want, especially in its current state, and audio hardware has become heavily commoditized.

>

>Other potential suitors, such as Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Microsoft Corp., wouldn’t make much sense either. Meta has all but exited the smart home, choosing to focus on AI and wearables instead. Google has a painful history with Sonos involving patent lawsuits. And Microsoft has increasingly scaled back its interest in non-Xbox hardware in recent years.

>

>Still, there are some major technology companies that might consider the idea. That list includes [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) Inc., Samsung Electronics Co., Roku Inc. and Spotify Technology SA.

>

>Amazon seems like the most natural fit. With former Microsoft Chief Product Officer Panos Panay now leading its hardware efforts, the expectation is that Amazon will revamp its device lineup and shift toward more upscale offerings. Sonos’ speakers already work with the entire streaming music industry and are certainly high-end.

>

>Sonos’ premium technology could be the basis for a series of new Amazon Echo devices running the upcoming AI-infused Alexa digital assistant. It would also help Amazon expand into new areas, such as over-ear headphones and soundbars — two categories the company has explored in the past.

>

>Amazon could certainly afford to buy Sonos, though it would have to overcome regulatory hurdles. Don’t forget: Amazon had to back out of a deal to buy Roomba maker iRobot Corp. after the European Union threatened to block the acquisition.

>

>A European company like Spotify might have an easier time getting a deal cleared. The streaming music service has championed the idea of hardware products that can run services from several different players, which Sonos does well. Spotify has long wanted to get into hardware but struggled to make it happen. Sonos would give them an instant entry, with an excellent range of products that could run its audio services.

>

>Roku is another possibility, though it would probably face antitrust concerns. After all, the company already sells a set of low-end soundbars and TV speakers. If it could make a deal work, Roku would get higher-end products that can potentially command higher profit margins. One caveat: This may need to be a stock-based deal given Roku doesn’t have as much cash on hand as its bigger rivals.

>

>Samsung is a wild card. The company already sells soundbars and subwoofers and even acquired the Harman brand in 2017. But it’s failed to crack the home speaker space. It announced an Echo-like speaker called the Galaxy Home several years ago but never actually brought it to market. Sonos would help it create a more consumer-focused line of home audio gear and provide more modern technology for its home theater products.

>

>For consumers, the best scenario is probably Sonos figuring things out and remaining independent — the current goal of the company. With the world’s biggest tech giants expanding into every facet of our lives, there is something appealing about an independent brand that plays nice with all the platforms. It’s just unclear how long Sonos will be able to do it alone.

>

>Retail inventory of the current iPhone SE quickly shrinks ahead of new model’s debut. One of Apple’s most significant new products this year will be the the iPhone SE’s replacement. The device — codenamed V59 — will mark the beginning of Apple’s transition from Qualcomm Inc. cellular modem chips to silicon designed in-house. It also means the company will no longer sell an iPhone with the now-antiquated home button. The latest model, which will also add Apple Intelligence, is set to launch by the spring — and there are signs Apple is gearing up for the release.

>

>According to people working in Apple’s retail operations, a surprisingly large number of US stores have little to no inventory of the iPhone SE remaining. Consumers can still get the device from the online store — and it ships out within a few days — but finding one at a brick-and-mortar outlet is going to be harder and harder. Apple also has ceased sales of the current SE in the European Union because the device lacks the now-required USB-C port.

>

>The drawing down of inventory is a reliable sign that a new model is coming. But it also suggests that Apple probably won’t keep the current version around — at a reduced price — after the update is here. That seems like a missed opportunity, since a cheap iPhone could’ve helped Apple make inroads in some markets. The current SE costs $429, and the new one might be more than that given its enhanced features.

>

>This new iPhone isn’t the only big product update on the horizon. As I wrote last week, look out for upcoming MacBook Airs with the M4 “Donan” chip, as well as fresh low-end iPads, iPad Airs and new Magic Keyboards in the not-too-distant future.

>

>Apple is bringing AI to Mac Mail app in macOS 15.4, even as it scales back notification summaries in iOS 18.3. The Apple Intelligence rollout is continuing with the release of macOS 15.3 in a few weeks. For the first time, Apple is bringing its Genmoji custom emoji to the Mac — following their debut on the iPhone and iPad. The company will add more features by April with iOS 18.4 and macOS 15.4. The big addition at that time will be the new Siri digital assistant, which will be able to better tap into personal information and use the App Intents technology to more precisely control apps.

>

>But there’s another, more under-the-radar feature coming in April as well: The Mac will get the upgraded Mail app that uses AI to prioritize messages and sort content into different inboxes. Right now, iPad and iPhone users are able to tap into the feature — which is terrific — but Mac customers have been left behind. That changes with macOS 15.4, I’m told. For those not familiar with the feature: It sorts mail into a primary category, as well as ones for transactions, promotions, updates and all mail.

>

>In other Apple Intelligence news, the company is scaling back notification summaries in iOS 18.3 and macOS 15.3. For months, news organizations and users have been complaining about incorrect or misleading notifications from Apple Intelligence. Rather than quickly fixing its AI models, Apple is simply pulling the plug on summaries from news and entertainment apps. You can also more easily disable summaries from the lock screen, and recaps are now italicized.

>

>Apple’s ex-chief people officer lands at HP. It’s not easy to join Apple after a career outside the company. The place is run by big personalities like Tim Cook, Phil Schiller, Greg Joswiak and others who have been there for several decades. In other words, if you’re walking into Apple thinking you’re going to change how it operates, you’re in for a surprise.

>

>That was the case with Carol Surface, who joined Apple in 2023 as chief people officer after working at Medtronic Plc, Best Buy Co. and PepsiCo Inc. She flamed out after less than two years. Stella Low, Apple’s short-lived vice president of communications, ran into similar issues in 2022.

>

>Both women were hired by Cook himself and stayed at Apple for way less time than anticipated, but now they have another thing in common: They landed at HP Inc. afterward. Low joined the computer maker as its chief communications officer in 2022 and recently left. Surface just agreed to join HP and is starting March 24. Given Surface’s successful and varied human resources career prior to Apple, she could end up being a good fit for HP.

>

>Speaking of Apple’s insidery culture: It was no surprise that Surface’s role was ultimately filled by Deirdre O’Brien, her predecessor and a 30-plus-year veteran of the company. Low, meanwhile, was replaced by Kristin Huguet, a member of Apple’s PR department since before the original iPhone went on sale.

>

>They’re both capable leaders, but Apple will eventually need to figure out how to bring in more talent from the outside. Right now, the company isn’t always built to handle fresh ideas from newcomers. With Apple’s need to innovate and find new sources of revenue, that might be a problem in the not-too-distant future.

>

**The Schedule**

>Jan. 22 — Samsung unveils Galaxy S25 line. Samsung is set to announce its Galaxy S25 smartphone lineup at its Unpacked event this week in San Jose, California. This year’s devices aren’t expected to get a major hardware overhaul, with the company instead focusing more on software and artificial intelligence features. But Samsung aims to show that it has an edge over Apple in this area. Stay tuned for coverage of Unpacked this week, including all of the details of the new devices. And if you’re waiting for news on Samsung smartwatches and foldable phones, those will likely debut later in the year.

>

>Jan. 30 — Apple’s first-quarter results. The earnings report — the first under Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh — will give details of Apple’s all-important holiday season. Investors will get an idea of how the iPhone 16 is selling, as well as updated AirPods and Apple Watches. The company also should provide the first real sense of whether the Apple Intelligence AI platform is spurring consumers to upgrade their devices. Wall Street is looking for about $124 billion in revenue during the period, a 4% gain from a year earlier.

>

>**Post Game Q&A**

>Q: Why is Tim Cook attending the Trump inauguration?

>A: Many Apple employees are none too pleased that their CEO is heading to Washington to kiss the ring and attend Trump’s swearing-in event on Monday. (Cook also personally donated $1 million to the inauguration fund.) The move seems to clash with Apple’s support of diversity, immigration and other progressive causes — ones that Cook himself has championed. But it’s equally clear that Apple may need Trump’s help over the next four years as it contends with tariffs, the Justice Department antitrust case and mounting pressure from the European Union. Cook likely believes Trump can alleviate these problems. He’s also not alone in turning out for the president-elect. Most of the world’s most valuable tech companies are sending a high-profile leader to the event.

>

>Q: When are the new Powerbeats Pro 2 launching?

>A: The latest earbuds from Apple’s Beats subsidiary are due imminently. The new accessory has already been submitted to the Federal Communications Commission and other regulators for approval, and the company is gearing up for a press briefing in a week or so to go over the details of the new product. The upgrades will feature a smaller overall design and improvements like Spatial Audio and enhanced noise cancellation that are already available on AirPods. The programming code within iOS also suggests that these earbuds could be capable of collecting heart-rate data from a wearer. I’ve previously reported that Apple is working on this technology and actively testing it.

>

>Q: Why is Apple starting to use US-made chips?

>A: A major, under-discussed risk facing Apple right now is that practically 100% of its advanced processors are made in Taiwan by partner TSMC. If Taiwan goes down for whatever reason (a political crisis, natural disaster or something else), Apple is in big trouble with no real plan B. That’s why moving more production to other areas is so critical, and such a shift is now underway. TSMC is running test production of lower-end Apple chips at a facility in Arizona, the first step toward more ambitious goals. Over time, Apple hopes to get chips from other factories in the US and elsewhere, including Europe. Let’s face it, the company has been fairly lucky so far that its chip production hasn’t suffered major hiccups. Apple’s reliance on one geographic location for the most important component in its devices has been a major hazard for years.

2025-01-19 18:43:38,Meta,META,Thoughts on ticktok ban and how would it impact meta stocks (worth shorting meta stocks?),"It seems like a significant number of TikTok users are growing frustrated with platforms like Facebook and Messenger, with many potentially rage-quitting or deleting these apps altogether. Considering TikTok’s massive user base—about 1 billion globally and 170 million in the U.S.—even a fraction of this shift could create a noticeable impact on Meta.

The question is, how might this trend affect Meta’s stock? On one hand, Meta has faced declines before and adapted through diversification and innovations like Instagram Reels. On the other, losing younger users—key to ad revenue—could hurt them long-term, especially with TikTok growing as a major competitor.

While Meta’s resources and global reach may help cushion the blow, the perception of a mass exodus could still shake investor confidence. Is this a temporary issue Meta can counter, or could it signal a deeper shift in the social media landscape?

2025-01-14 17:57:30,Meta,META,Meta announces 5% cuts in preparation for 'intense year' — Read the internal memo,"Meta is set to cut about 5% of its workforce, focusing on the company’s lowest-performing staffers, CNBC confirmed Tuesday.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg informed employees about the decision to “move out low performers faster” in a memo posted on the company’s internal Workplace forum on Tuesday. Zuckerberg told employees 2025 will “be an intense year.”

The company specified that it is “exiting approximately 5% of our lowest performers” in a separate message posted by a company director. The company has more than 72,000 employees, according to its most recent quarterly report.

Meta said employees affected by the cuts will be notified by Feb. 10 and receive severance in line with what the company has provided previously. The cuts represent Meta’s largest layoffs since the company eliminated 21,000 jobs, or nearly a quarter of its workforce, in 2022 and 2023.

Bloomberg was first to report the cuts, citing an internal memo.

The move follows several major operational changes within Meta aimed at building closer ties with President-elect Donald Trump.

Last week, Zuckerberg announced Meta would end its third-party fact-checking program in favor of a “Community Notes” model used on Elon Musk’s platform X, where individual users provide more context to posts.

“The recent elections also feel like a cultural tipping point towards once again prioritizing speech, so we’re going to get back to our roots and focus on reducing mistakes, simplifying our polices and restoring free expression on our platforms,” Zuckerberg said in a video announcement.

Below is Zuckeberg’s internal memo, which CNBC obtained:

""Meta is working on building some of the most important technologies of the world. AI, glasses as the next computing platform and the future of social media. This is going to be an intense year, and I want to make sure we have the best people on our teams.

I’ve decided to raise the bar on performance management and move out low performers faster. We typically manage out people who aren’t meeting expectations over the course of a year, but now we’re going to do more extensive performance-based cuts during this cycle, with the intention of back filling these roles in 2025. We won’t manage out everyone who didn’t meet expectations for the last period if we’re optimistic about their future performance, and for those we do let go, we’ll provide generous severance in line with what we provided with previous cuts. 

We’ll follow up with more guidance for managers ahead of calibrations. People who are impacted will be notified on February 10 or later for those outside the U.S.""

2025-01-14 00:21:10,Meta,META,China Discusses Sale of TikTok US to Musk as One Possible Option,"Bloomberg: Chinese officials are evaluating a potential option that involves Elon Musk acquiring the US operations of TikTok if the company fails to fend off a controversial ban on the short-video app, according to people familiar with the matter.

Beijing officials strongly prefer that TikTok remains under the ownership of parent ByteDance Ltd., the people say, and the company is contesting the impending ban with an appeal to the US Supreme Court. But the justices signaled during arguments on Jan. 10 that they are likely to uphold the law. Senior Chinese officials had already begun to debate contingency plans for TikTok as part of an expansive discussion on how to work with Donald Trump’s administration, one of which involves Musk, said the people, asking not to be identified revealing confidential discussions.

A potential high-profile deal with one of Trump’s closest allies holds some appeal for the Chinese government, which is expected to have some say over whether TikTok is ultimately sold, said the people. Musk spent more than $250 million supporting Trump’s re-election, and has been tapped for a prominent role in improving government efficiency after the Republican takes office.

Under one scenario that’s been discussed by the Chinese government, Musk’s X — the former Twitter — would take control of TikTok US and run the businesses together, the people said. With more than 170 million users in the US, TikTok could bolster X’s efforts to attract advertisers. Musk also founded a separate artificial intelligence company, xAI, that could benefit from the huge amounts of data generated from TikTok.

Chinese officials have yet to reach any firm consensus about how to proceed and their deliberations are still preliminary, the people said. It’s not clear how much ByteDance knows about the Chinese government discussions or whether TikTok and Musk have been involved. It’s also unclear whether Musk, TikTok and ByteDance have held any talks about the terms of any possible deal.

Musk and his representatives did not respond to a request for comment. Musk posted in April that he thinks TikTok should remain available in the US. “In my opinion, TikTok should not be banned in the USA, even though such a ban may benefit the X platform,” he wrote on X. “Doing so would be contrary to freedom of speech and expression. It is not what America stands for.”

ByteDance and TikTok representatives didn’t respond to messages seeking comment. The Cyberspace Administration of China and China’s Ministry of Commerce, government agencies that could be involved in decisions about TikTok’s future, also didn’t respond to requests for comment.

The talks in Beijing suggest that TikTok’s fate may no longer be in ByteDance’s sole control, said the people. Chinese officials recognize they will face tough negotiations with the Trump administration over tariffs, export controls and other issues, and they see the TikTok negotiations as a potential area for reconciliation, they said.

The Chinese government holds a so-called golden share in a ByteDance affiliate that gives it influence over the company’s strategy and operations. TikTok maintains that the control only applies to the China-based subsidiary Douyin Information Service Co., and has no bearing on ByteDance operations outside China. Still, Beijing’s export rules prevent Chinese companies from selling their software algorithms, like the one integral to TikTok. Because the Chinese government would have to approve of a sale that includes TikTok’s valuable recommendation engine, it has a significant voice in any possible deal.

TikTok’s US operations could be valued at around $40 billion to $50 billion, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Mandeep Singh and Damian Reimertz estimated last year. That’s a substantial sum even for the world’s richest person. It’s not clear how Musk could pull off such a transaction, whether it would require the sale of other holdings, or whether the US government would approve. He paid $44 billion for Twitter in 2022, and is still paying off sizable loans.

Musk has a positive reputation among many ByteDance employees in China, according to a person familiar with the matter. He is seen as a very successful entrepreneur, who has experience engaging with the Chinese government through his Tesla Inc. business, the person added.

ByteDance’s leaders have repeatedly said their priority is to fight US legislation that requires the Beijing-based company sell or shut down the US operations because of national security concerns. TikTok’s lawyers have argued the legislation violates free speech laws under the Constitution’s First Amendment.

A majority of the Supreme Court justices suggested the security concerns take priority over free speech, although they have yet to issue a formal decision. President-elect Trump, who takes office Jan. 20, has sought to delay the TikTok ban — which takes effect Jan. 19 — so he can work on the negotiations. He has said he wants to “save” the app and there’s been speculation he could take last-minute action to sidestep the ban.

On a practical level, spinning off TikTok’s US business would be highly complex, affecting shareholders in China as well as the US. Lawyers for TikTok argued before the Supreme Court that separating the US portions of the product would be “extraordinarily difficult.”

It’s unclear if US TikTok would be sold off in a competitive process, or if a sale would be arranged by the government. Billionaire Frank McCourt and “Shark Tank” investor Kevin O’Leary are part of a bid through Project Liberty to acquire TikTok, which O’Leary has said he discussed with Trump. In the past, Microsoft Corp. had sought to acquire the business, and Oracle Corp. has a deep technology partnership with the company.

One alternative for TikTok would be to move its existing US customers over to a similar app — with different branding — to potentially sidestep the ban, one of the people said. It’s not clear how effective such a move would be.

One person close to the company, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the strategy, said before the Supreme Court hearing that the legal battle is still the focus of top executives and they would prefer to keep fighting in the US rather than sell TikTok US and cede control for good.

Musk is in a position to influence the China-US relationship as the world’s richest person with businesses that straddle the world’s two largest economies. Tesla, where Musk is chief executive officer, erected a sprawling factory in Shanghai in 2019 and has since expanded the facility into the company’s largest production base. The effort helped Tesla expand its market share in China despite tough local competition, and build goodwill with government officials.

While Trump is staffing his incoming administration with China hawks like Secretary of State nominee Marco Rubio, Musk has spoken out against some recent China trade policies, including the Biden administration’s tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles.

**Thoughts:** Obviously this type of news has the ability to move TSLA/META/social networks. We've seen TSLA make moves from political news, SpaceX news, Twitter news, and TSLA trades as a proxy to whatever Elon Musk is doing at the time even if it's not directly applicable to TSLA as a company.

2025-01-12 18:44:23,Meta,META,S&P’s $18 Trillion Rally Threatened by Psychology of 5% Yields,">For years it’s seemed like nothing could stop the stock market’s inexorable march higher, as the S&P 500 Index soared more than 50% from the start of 2023 to the end of 2024, adding $18 trillion in value in the process. Now, however, Wall Street is seeing what can ultimately derail this rally: Treasury yields above 5%.

>Equities traders have shrugged off the bond market’s warnings for months, focusing instead on the windfall from President-elect Donald Trump’s promised tax cuts and the seemingly limitless possibilities of artificial intelligence. But the risk came into focus last week as Treasury yields climbed toward their ominous milestones and share prices sank in response.

>The yield on 20-year US Treasuries breached 5% on Wednesday and jumped back above on Friday, reaching the highest since Nov. 2, 2023. Meanwhile, 30-year US Treasuries briefly crossed 5% on Friday to the highest since Oct. 31, 2023. Those yields have risen roughly 100 basis points since mid-September, when the Federal Reserve started reducing the fed funds rate, which has come down 100 basis points over the same time.

>“It is unusual,” Jeff Blazek, co-CIO of multi-asset strategies at Neuberger Berman, said of the dramatic and rapid jump in bond yields in the early months of an easing cycle. Over the past 30 years, intermediate and longer-term yields have been relatively flat or modestly higher in the months after the Fed initiated a string of rate cuts, he added.

>Traders are watching the policy-sensitive 10-year Treasury yield, which is the highest it’s been since October 2023 and is rapidly approaching 5%, a level they fear could spark a stock market correction. It last passed the threshold briefly in October 2023, and before that you have to go back to July 2007.

>“If the 10-year hits 5% there will be a knee-jerk reaction to sell stocks,” said Matt Peron, Janus Henderson’s global head of solutions. “Episodes like this take weeks or maybe a few months to play out, and over the course of that the S&P 500 could get to down 10%.”

>The reason is fairly simple. Rising bond yields make returns on Treasuries more attractive, while also increasing the cost of raising capital for companies.

>The spillover into the stock market was apparent on Friday, as the S&P 500 tumbled 1.5% for its worst day since mid-December, turned negative for 2025, and came close to wiping out all the gains from the November euphoria sparked by Trump’s election.

>While there’s “no magic” to the fixation on 5% beyond round-number psychology, perceived barriers can create “technical barriers,” said Kristy Akullian, Blackrock’s head of iShares investment strategy. Meaning, a swift move in yields can make it difficult for stocks to rise.

>Investors are already seeing how. The earnings yield for the S&P 500 is sitting 1 percentage point below what’s offered by 10-year Treasuries, a development last seen in 2002. In other words, the return on owning a significantly less risky asset than the US equities benchmark hasn’t been this good in a long time.

>“Once yields get higher it becomes harder and harder to rationalize valuation levels,” said Mike Reynolds, vice president of investment strategy at Glenmede Trust. “And if earnings growth starts to falter, there can be issues.”

>Not surprisingly, strategists and portfolio managers predict a bumpy road ahead for stocks. Morgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson anticipates a tough six months for equities, while Citigroup’s wealth division told clients there’s a buying opportunity in bonds.

>The path to 5% on the 10-year Treasury became more realistic on Friday after strong jobs data caused economists to reduce expectations for rate cuts this year. But this isn’t just about the Fed. The selloff in bonds is global and based on sticky inflation, hawkish central banks, ballooning government debts, and extreme uncertainties presented by the incoming Trump administration.

>“When you’re in hostile waters, yields above 5% is where all bets are off,” Mark Malek, chief investment officer at Siebert, said.

>What equity investors need to know now is if, and when, serious buyers step in.

>“The real question is where we go from there,” said Rick de los Reyes, a portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price. “If it’s 5% on its way to 6% then that’s going to get people concerned, if it’s 5% before stabilizing and ultimately going lower then things will be fine.”

>Red Flags

>The key isn’t so much that yields are rising, but why, market pros say. A slow increase as the US economy improves can help stocks. But a quick jump due to concerns about inflation, the federal deficit and policy uncertainty is a red flag.

>In recent years, whenever yields have risen quickly, stocks have sold off. The difference this time appears to be complacent investors, as seen in bullish positioning in the face of frothy valuations and uncertainties about Trump’s policies. And that’s putting equities in a vulnerable position.

>“When you look at rising prices, a strong job market and an overall strong economy, it all points to a possible uptick in inflation,” said Eric Diton, president of the Wealth Alliance. “And that’s not even including Trump’s policies.”

>One area that may prove to be a haven for equity investors is the group that’s been driving most of the gains these past few years: Big Tech. The so-called Magnificent Seven companies — Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp. and Tesla Inc. — are still posting rapid earnings growth and massive cash flows. Plus, looking to the future, they’re expected to be the biggest beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence revolution.

>“Investors typically seek high quality stocks with strong balance sheets and strong cash flows during market turmoil,” said Eric Sterner, chief investment officer at Apollon Wealth. “The mega techs have become part of that defensive play recently.”

>That’s the hope many equity investors are hanging on, that mega-cap tech companies’ sway over the broader market and their relative security will limit any weakness in the stock market. The Magnificent Seven have a more than 30% weighting in the S&P 500.

>At the same time, the Fed is in the midst of lowering interest rates, although the pace is likely going to be slower than expected. That makes this a very different situation than 2022, when the Fed was hiking rates rapidly and indexes plunged.

>Still, many Wall Street pros are urging investors to proceed cautiously for the time being as rate risk hits in various unexpected ways.

>“The companies in the S&P 500 that are up the most will probably be the most vulnerable — and that could include the Mag Seven — and some frothy areas of mid-cap and small-cap growth will likely be under pressure,” said Janus Henderson’s Peron. “We’ve been consistent across our firm on staying focused on quality and being valuation sensitive. That will be very important in the coming months.”

> Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg thinks Apple “[hasn’t] really invented anything great in a while” and that it has been coasting off of its past success. “Steve Jobs invented the iPhone and now they’re just kind of sitting on it 20 years later,” he said this week. Zuckerberg made the statements during a nearly three-hour long podcast with Joe Rogan where, along with discussing Meta’s moderation policy changes and turn against diversity and inclusion policies, they got into Meta’s beef with Apple and its policies.

> The conversation actually started with Rogan’s issues with Apple. Rogan said he’s moving “from Apple to Android” in part because he doesn’t “like being attached to one company.” He also isn’t a fan of Apple’s App Store policies. “The way they do that Apple store, where they charge people 30 percent,” he said. “That seems so insane that they can get away with doing that.” “I have some opinions about this,” Zuckerberg said. While he gives credit to the iPhone as “obviously one of the most important inventions probably of all time,” he argued that Apple has put rules in place that “feel arbitrary.” Zuckerberg said that Apple has “thoroughly hamstrung the ability for anyone else to build something that can connect to the iPhone in the same way” as Apple’s own products, like the AirPods. If Apple let other people use its protocol, “there would probably be much better competitors to AirPods out there,” Zuckerberg said.

> Down the line, Zuckerberg envisions a world where you’ll be able to use the neural interface wristband and the glasses to text a friend or an AI and have the glasses give you the answer. He also believes that as smart glasses or even contact lenses as a computing platform become more developed, the internet will be “overlaid” on the physical world. “I think we’ll basically be in this wild world where most of the world will be physical, but there will be this increasing amount of virtual objects or people who are beaming in or hologramming into different things to interact in different ways,” he said. “There isn’t a physical world and a digital world anymore,” he added. “We’re in 2025. It’s one world.”",922,463,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hz09io/meta_ceo_mark_zuckerberg_trash_talks_apple_in/

Now, Amazon is letting other sites use its ad technology for their own stores.

>The new offering, called Amazon Retail Ad Service, allows companies to show “contextually relevant ads in the right place and at the right time” in search results, product pages and other areas of their site, Amazon said Thursday.

>It’s initially available for U.S. retailers, which will pay fees based on usage levels. Prices weren’t disclosed.

>Amazon in 2022 began breaking out ad revenue in its quarterly earnings reports, showing that the business had become a significant contributor to the company’s top and bottom lines. Ad revenue in the latest quarter came in at $14.3 billion, third to Alphabet and Meta in digital advertising.

>That’s still much less than the sales Amazon generates from online stores and cloud computing, which came to $61.4 billion and $27.4 billion, respectively, in the quarter that ended in October.

>The bulk of Amazon’s ad revenue comes from sponsored product advertisements, which are keyword-targeted ads that let brands promote certain items. Amazon has stuffed more of these sponsored items into search results and product pages over time. It also generates some ad revenue through streaming.

>With Amazon Retail Ad Service, users will be able to customize the design, placement and number of ads shown across their sites, as well as use Amazon’s ad measurement and reporting tools.

>The service could provide Amazon with valuable data it can use to bolster its ad prediction and recommendation technology. The company said early customers include health and wellness retailer iHerb, Asian grocery startup Weee! and Oriental Trading Co., which sells toys, party and craft supplies.

>“We’ve designed this to be a win for retailers, advertisers, and shoppers, and we look forward to seeing how it improves outcomes, drives sales and enhances the shopping experience,” said Paula Despins, vice president of Amazon Ads Measurement, in the press release.

>The announcement comes a few days before the National Retail Federation’s annual trade show.

>It’s not the first time Amazon has sold its in-house technology and services to third parties.

>Amazon Web Services began as cloud infrastructure to support its online retail business. The company launched AWS as a business in 2006. In 2022, the company launched Buy With Prime, which combines Amazon’s payment and fulfillment services for other retailers.

Two Israeli companies, Teva Pharmaceuticals and Wix.com, have been selected as top picks for 2025 by leading US analysts.

Bank of America included Teva in its biopharma survey, highlighting the company’s strong performance and potential for continued growth. Teva, which is led by CEO Richard Francis, saw its stock rise by 111% in 2024 and now has a market cap of $24.6 billion. Bank of America raised its price target for Teva shares from $25 to $26, citing positive financial results, plans to sell its active ingredients division, and significant debt reduction efforts. Additionally, the success of duvakitug, a drug for inflammatory bowel disease co-developed with Sanofi, boosted investor confidence after strong Phase 2 trial results. Analysts believe Teva's strong product pipeline and turnaround strategy leave room for further price increases.

In the Internet sector, Cantor Fitzgerald selected Wix.com as a top pick alongside major players like Meta, Amazon, and DoorDash. Wix, under the leadership of CEO Avishai Abrahami, saw its stock rise by 74% in 2024, bringing its market cap to $12.1 billion. Cantor Fitzgerald raised its price target for Wix shares from $240 to $260, emphasizing the company's robust roadmap, pricing strength, and new AI product launches. Analysts believe these factors will drive growth and expand Wix’s trading multiples. Furthermore, Wix is seen as a potential acquisition target, adding to its attractiveness for investors. 

Both companies have demonstrated significant momentum and are positioned for further success in 2025, driven by innovation and strategic initiatives.",0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hwoxed/us_analysts_list_teva_wix_in_2025_top_picks/
2025-01-07 13:35:58,Meta,META,"Meta scraps fact checking program, is bringing back political content","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/07/meta-eliminates-third-party-fact-checking-moves-to-community-notes.html

Meta on Tuesday announced it will eliminate its third-party fact checking program to “restore free expression” and move to a “Community Notes” model, similar to the system that exists on Elon Musk’s platform X.

The company said Community Notes will be written and rated by contributing users to provide more context to posts across its platforms, and the feature will roll out in the U.S. over the next couple of months. The announcement marks Meta’s latest attempt to smooth over relations with Republican President-elect Donald Trump before he takes office.

“We’ve reached a point where it’s just too many mistakes, and too much censorship,” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Tuesday in a video announcement. “The recent elections also feel like a cultural tipping point towards once again prioritizing speech, so we’re going to get back to our roots and focus on reducing mistakes, simplifying our polices and restoring free expression on our platforms.”

Zuckerberg said the third-party fact checkers have been “too politically biased” and have “destroyed more trust than they’ve created, especially in the U.S.”

Meta said it will simplify its content policies by removing restrictions on subjects like immigration and gender and implement a new approach to policy enforcement that will focus on illegal and high severity violations. The company is moving its trust and safety and content moderation teams from California, a historically Democratic state, to Texas, a historically Republican state.

“We’re going to work with President Trump to push back on governments around the world that are going after American companies and pushing to censor more,” Zuckerberg said.

Joel Kaplan, Meta’s head of global policy, appeared on “Fox and Friends” Tuesday and said Meta thinks the Community Notes system on Musk’s platform X has been working “really well.” Musk, who has been a vocal advocate for Trump online and donated millions of dollars to his campaign, has been in close contact with the president-elect since the election.

Last week, Meta said that Kaplan would become the company’s top policy officer, replacing Nick Clegg, who was a former British deputy prime minister and a leader of Britain’s centrist Liberal Democrats party.

Kaplan, who has held several policy related positions at Meta since joining the company in 2011 when it was still named Facebook, is well-known within the Republican party. He was a White House deputy chief of staff under former President George W. Bush and also once worked as a law clerk for former Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.

In December, Kaplan revealed in a Facebook post that he joined Vice-President Elect JD Vance and Trump during their recent visit at the New York Stock Exchange.

“We want to make it so that, bottom line, if you can say it on TV, you say it on the floor of Congress, you certainly ought to be able to say it on Facebook and Instagram without fear of censorship,” Kaplan said Tuesday.

Prominent Republican lawmakers have previously criticized Meta and other technology companies for allegations regarding the censorship of conservative voices on their respective platforms. For instance, House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, subpoenaed Zuckerberg and other tech CEOs in 2023 as part of a probe to “understand how and to what extent the Executive Branch coerced and colluded with companies and other intermediaries to censor speech.”

Zuckerberg has had a rocky relationship with Trump over the years, with the president-elect more recently describing Facebook as an “enemy of the people” in a March interview with CNBC. Meta levied a two-year suspension on Trump’s Facebook and Instagram accounts in 2021 shortly after the company determined that the former president’s actions following the Jan. 6 insurrection in Washington, D.C., could potentially incite more violence.

In 2023, Trump was able to regain access to his Facebook and Instagram accounts, but he also faced some restrictions and potential penalties if he were to violate the company’s community guidelines. Meta eventually removed Trump’s account-related restrictions in July during the lead up to the 2024 U.S. presidential election.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg — an avid mixed martial arts fan — announced the addition of White and two other board members, John Elkann and Charlie Songhurst, Monday.

“Dana, John and Charlie will add a depth of expertise and perspective that will help us tackle the massive opportunities ahead with AI, wearables and the future of human connection,” Zuckerberg said in a statement.

In a post on Facebook, Zuckerberg said that he had been working on add the nw board members for a while, and of White he wrote that “I’ve admired him as an entrepreneur and his ability to build such a beloved brand.”

“I’ve never been interested in joining a board of directors until I got the offer to join Meta’s board,” White added in a statement. “I am a huge believer that social media and AI are the future.”

“I am very excited to join this incredible team and to learn more about this business from the inside,” he added. “There is nothing I love more than building brands, and I look forward to helping take Meta to the next level.”

White joins John Elkann, the CEO of European investment firm Exor, and the executive chairman of Ferrari, and Charlie Songhurst, a veteran technology investor, on the board.

Zuckerberg and White are friendly, with the Facebook founder an occasional guest at UFC matches. Zuckerberg has also trained with UFC fighters, and competed in local MMA bouts in California.

White is also very close with incoming President Trump, who Zuckerberg and other tech moguls have tried to forge a relationship with ahead of his second term.

2024-12-16 15:18:27,Meta,META,From GPU to ASIC: Broadcom to capture NVDA  market share!,"Broadcom Surge Highlights the Importance of AI

Let’s start with some expert opinions I read over the weekend about Broadcom’s impressive rally views I completely agree with

At the hardware level, training costs are skyrocketing, limiting participation to a few CSP (cloud service providers) that can afford it.     As economies of scale see diminishing returns, these companies are shifting their strategies toward customer acquisition, commercialization, and retention—similar to Microsoft’s current approach.     With growing focus on model deployment and revenue generation, inference is bound to take center stage.     Open source models are becoming more valuable, enabling AI application developers to focus on building apps rather than training models from scratch.     It’s akin to the role Linux played during the cloud operating system boom.

The traditional scaling laws based on data are nearing a bottleneck.     We’re likely approaching the end of the pretraining era, with the future pointing towards the ""Agent and Reason"" age.

Here’s the key takeaway: Broadcom predicts that by 2027, its three largest existing clients (likely ByteDance, Google, and Meta) will deploy over one million arithmetic card units.     Additionally, two more clients are undergoing validation, potentially driving $60–90 billion in AI-related revenue.    That said, expectations for overall AI capital expenditure changes remain modest.

This shift represents more of a structural change in existing capital allocation.   NVIDIA, which currently dominates with over 75% of the arithmetic card market, may see its lead challenged.     Broadcom’s ASIC solutions and NVIDIA’s GPUs could eventually share the market.    Once AI models stabilize, ASIC—being application-specific—could offer a significant cost advantage over general purpose GPU.

For major cloud providers, the massive capital expenditures have sparked criticism from shareholders.     At this point, these companies must demonstrate revenue growth to justify the spending.

As I write this, AVGO  is soaring again.     Broadcom rise was anticipated, but the market sentiment is electrifying.     Investors are desperately hunting for the next NVDA.     After cashing out Tesla last week, I thought Monday might bring a big move for Tesla.     Instead, Broadcom stole the spotlight.     While Tesla did rise, it couldn’t match Broadcom momentum.

After the close Monday, Oracle reported adjusted earnings per share for the fiscal second quarter of $1.47, trailing analysts’ average estimate by a penny, according to LSEG. Revenue rose 9% from a year earlier to $14.06 billion, missing the $14.1 billion average estimate.

Net income increased 26% to $3.15 billion, or $1.10 a share, from $2.5 billion, or 89 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue in Oracle’s cloud services business jumped 12% from a year earlier to $10.81 billion, accounting for 77% of total revenue.

“A bit of a stumble here for a stock that’s created some lofty expectations for itself,” wrote analysts at KeyBank Capital Markets in a note after the report on Monday. They still recommend buying the stock and said “we still like oracle heading into 2025.”

For the current quarter, Oracle expects revenue growth of 7% to 9%. At the midpoint of that range, revenue would be about $14.3 billion. Analysts were expecting sales of $14.65 billion, according to LSEG. The company said it expects adjusted earnings of $1.50 to $1.54 per share. Analysts were calling for earnings per share of $1.57.

Oracle’s biggest growth engine has been cloud infrastructure, where it is competing with Amazon, Microsoft and Google as businesses move workloads out of their own data centers.  
  
The business is booming due to soaring demand for computing power that can handle artificial intelligence projects. Oracle said revenue in its cloud infrastructure unit surged 52% from a year earlier to $2.4 billion.  
  
Oracle said it just signed an agreement with Meta, allowing the social media company to use its infrastructure to help with various projects related to the Llama family of large language models.

“Oracle Cloud Infrastructure trains several of the world’s most important generative AI models because we are faster and less expensive than other clouds,” Oracle founder Larry Ellison said in a statement.

Analysts at Piper Sandler raised their price target on the stock to $210 from $185 “based on continued cloud momentum.” They cited Oracle’s cRPO (current remaining performance obligations) growth of 20%. That figures points to contracted revenue that has yet to be booked.

2024-12-05 04:36:54,Meta,META,Protecting Gains on 300 META Shares Without Selling: Selling Deep ITM Calls Strategy,"
I currently hold 300 shares of META that I purchased back in March and have seen decent gains. I want to protect these profits without triggering taxes from selling before the one-year mark (to qualify for long-term capital gains).

I’m considering selling deep in-the-money (ITM) calls with March expiration. These options would expire shortly after my one-year holding period, so my shares would be eligible for long-term capital gains if exercised after expiration.

I understand that selling deep ITM calls could constrain my margin account while the options are open. Aside from that, are there any other risks or pitfalls I should be aware of with this strategy? For example:
	•	Could this strategy be flagged as a “constructive sale” by the IRS?
	•	What happens if the calls are exercised before the March expiration?
	•	Are there better alternatives to hedge while preserving my tax situation?

2024-12-04 23:19:53,Meta,META,Meta Announces $10 Billion Data Center in Louisiana,"[https://www.barrons.com/articles/meta-data-center-louisiana-location-2828b80a](https://www.barrons.com/articles/meta-data-center-louisiana-location-2828b80a)

META, the parent company of Facebook, is spending $10 billion to build its largest data center ever in Louisiana, the company confirmed on Wednesday.

The data center will take up 4 million square feet of an industrial site in the northern half of the state that once held a headlight factory.

The center will be powered by three new natural gas plants with 2.2 gigawatts of combined capacity, according to Entergy, the utility working with the tech giant. That is enough to power more than one million homes. Neal Kirby, an Entergy spokesman, said the plants will also provide power to the surrounding community.

“Entergy raised its earnings growth outlook substantially (solely because of this 1 new customer) and the stock rose 15% on that day,” wrote Rodney Rebello, an analyst covering power stocks at Reaves Asset Management, in an email to *Barron’s*. “It’s a monumental deal for the sector.”

Meta spokeswoman Stacey Yip told *Barron’s* the Louisiana data center “will be significantly larger than our other data center campuses.”

The company didn’t say how many GPUs the new facility will be able to support. Yip said estimating the future number of GPUs is becoming complex as GPU technology becomes more efficient.

Yip also said Meta will invest in 1.5 gigawatts worth of renewable energy, such as solar and wind, to reduce its carbon footprint. All told, Meta will help finance “enough clean and renewable energy to the grid to match the total electricity use of this data center,” she wrote in an email.

But it isn’t clear when those renewable projects will start. Entergy has filed for permission with the state utilities commission to build the natural gas plants, but not the renewable ones yet, Kirby said.

Meta also said on Tuesday that it is exploring using nuclear energy to power data centers, and asked companies in that field to submit proposals for nuclear reactors. Any reactors wouldn’t be available until well into the 2030s, however.

Meta is investing heavily in artificial intelligence and has been expanding the number of data centers it uses to process its AI applications. But even as the AI race accelerates, this Louisiana data center doesn’t look like it will be completed soon. The company said construction will “continue through 2030 with site work beginning in December.”

2024-11-28 14:25:22,Meta,META,Reddit overtakes X in popularity of social media platforms in UK $RDDT,"[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/28/reddit-overtakes-x-in-popularity-of-social-media-platforms-in-uk](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/28/reddit-overtakes-x-in-popularity-of-social-media-platforms-in-uk)

Reddit, the American online discussion platform, has overtaken X to become the fifth most popular social media platform in the UK, according to the communications watchdog.

Ofcom said Reddit, where users post on discussion threads within topic-based communities, was visited by 22.9 million UK adults in May this year, compared with 22.1 million on X.

The figures make Reddit the fastest-growing large social media platform in the UK and represent a growth of 47% on the same period in 2023. The leap took Reddit above LinkedIn and X into fifth place on the table of UK social media platforms, which is now topped by YouTube after it overtook [Facebook](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook), reaching more than 44 million adults.

Reddit, renowned for its devoted user base who refer to one another as Redditors, appears to have been boosted by updates to Google’s search engine this year.

Farhad Divecha, the managing director of the UK-based digital marketing agency AccuraCast, said: “Google’s latest algorithm update in the first half of 2024 gave Reddit a big boost in organic search traffic. I think that has probably contributed a lot.”

Ofcom also speculated that the change may have been caused [by alterations to how third-party apps accessed its content](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/14/reddit-moderators-vow-to-continue-blackout-in-api-access-fees-row), forcing users of those apps to switch to the Reddit site. The watchdog also flagged publicity around Reddit’s stock market flotation in March this year.

The popularity of X also fell over the same period, according to Ofcom, with its reach falling by 8% since May last year. X has been criticised over content moderation standards since its [takeover by Elon Musk in 2022](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/oct/28/elon-musk-twitter-hate-speech-concerns-stock-exchange-deal) but it has also faced competition since July 2023 from Threads, a rival to X [launched by Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jul/06/meta-launches-twitter-rival-threads-in-100-countries).

The Ofcom figures featured in the watchdog’s annual report into the nation’s digital habits, which revealed that four out of 10 UK adults say they have encountered misinformation or deepfakes, with the majority of those cases occurring online.

The misinformation survey, based on a poll of more than 4,000 UK adults, also found that three in 10 adults believe there is a single group of people who control the world together, with the same number believing there is “significant evidence” of electoral fraud in the UK.

The regulator also found that one-third of UK adults are not confident in judging whether an image or a piece of audio or video has been created by artificial intelligence.",1071,155,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h1x2aj/reddit_overtakes_x_in_popularity_of_social_media/
2024-11-28 01:38:14,Meta,META,Microsoft faces wide-ranging U.S. antitrust probe,"The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has opened a broad antitrust investigation into Microsoft, including of its software licensing and cloud computing businesses, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.

The probe was approved by FTC Chair Lina Khan ahead of her likely departure in January. The election of Donald Trump as U.S. president, and the expectation he will appoint a fellow Republican with a softer approach toward business, leaves the outcome of the investigation up in the air.  
  
The FTC is examining allegations the software giant is potentially abusing its market power in productivity software by imposing punitive licensing terms to prevent customers from moving their data from its Azure cloud service to other competitive platforms, sources confirmed earlier this month.  
  
The FTC is also looking at practices related to cybersecurity and artificial intelligence products, the source said on Wednesday.

Microsoft declined to comment on Wednesday.  
  
The FTC fielded complaints about Microsoft last year as it examined the cloud computing market.

NetChoice, a lobbying group that represents online companies including Amazon and Google, which compete with Microsoft in cloud computing, criticized Microsoft’s licensing policies, and its integration of AI tools into its Office and Outlook.

“Given that Microsoft is the world’s largest software company, dominating in productivity and operating systems software, the scale and consequences of its licensing decisions are extraordinary,” the group said.  
The FTC has demanded a broad range of detailed information from Microsoft, Bloomberg reported earlier on Wednesday.  
  
Until now, Microsoft has been somewhat of an exception to U.S. antitrust regulators’ recent campaign against allegedly anticompetitive practices at Big Tech companies.  
  
Facebook owner Meta Platforms, Apple, and Amazon.com Inc. have all been accused by the U.S. of unlawfully maintaining monopolies.  
  
Alphabet’s Google is facing two lawsuits, including one where a judge found it unlawfully thwarted competition among online search engines.  
  
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella testified at Google’s trial, saying the search giant was using exclusive deals with publishers to lock up content used to train artificial intelligence.  
  
It is unclear whether Trump will ease up on Big Tech, whose first administration launched several Big Tech probes. JD Vance, the incoming vice president, has expressed concern about the power the companies wield over public discourse.  
  
Still, Microsoft has benefited from Trump policies in the past.  
  
In 2019, the Pentagon awarded it a $10 billion cloud computing contract that Amazon had widely been expected to win. Amazon later alleged that Trump exerted improper pressure on military officials to steer the contract away from its Amazon Web Services unit.

2024-11-27 10:20:49,Meta,META,Deep dive into Kering - From Timber to Gucci: A Legacy of Acquisitions,"**1.0 Introduction**

Let’s start with a fun fact. Kering, the company that owns brands like Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent, Balenciaga, Bottega Veneta, and Alexander McQueen, started as a **timber-trading company**.

Although it started back in 1962 and operated in a different industry, its DNA and management style haven’t changed much.

As I’m writing this, its share price is **down over 70%** from its peak back in August 2021 that was elevated due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

  
**2.0 The journey from timber to luxury**

***2.1 The timber period (1962 - 1988)***

The company was founded in France by François Pinault back in 1962 with a 100,000 francs loan from the bank. The business grew rapidly by **acquiring** many failing local timber traders in France, especially in the 1980s. By 1988, it owned 180 companies and 33 factories.

***2.2 The switch from timber to retail to luxury (1988 - 2013 - present)***

In 1988, it was listed on the Paris Stock Exchange and the first transformation from timber to retail started:

* It merged with CFAO (A French distribution conglomerate)
* Acquired Conforama (French furniture retailer)
* Acquired Printemps (Department stores)
* Acquired 54% of La Redoute (French mail-order shopping retailer)
* Acquired Finac (French bookstore, multimedia, and electronics retailer)

The transformation from retail to luxury started in 1999 when it acquired 42% of **Gucci Group,** 100% of **Boucheron,** and 100% of **Yves Saint Laurent.** Today, Gucci accounts for 47% of its revenue.

François-Henri Pinault, the son of the founder François Pinault, became general manager of the company in 2003, and CEO in 2005. Under his leadership, the acquisitions in the luxury space continued.

It is important to note the divestments of their previous acquisitions (Conforama, Le Printemps, CFAO, and Fnac).

Its portfolio is quite diversified and includes:

* High-end clothing
* Footwear
* Handbags and leather goods
* Sunglasses and eyewear
* Scarves & other fashion accessories
* Jewelry
* Fragrances (due to the Creed acquisition)
* Cosmetics (in early stage)
* Watches

It is also geographically diversified:

* **APAC (excl. Japan)**: 32% of revenue
* **Western Europe**: 28% of revenue
* **North America**: 23% of revenue
* **Japan**: 8% of revenue
* **Rest of the World**: 9% of revenue

**3.0 Historical financial performance**

Its revenue increased from €15.9 billion in 2019, to €20.4 billion in 2022, and has contracted back to €18.4 billion as the demand for personal luxury goods started to decrease after the pandemic. 

Kering’s gross margin is stable at \~75%, meaning the direct costs are well controlled.

However, its operating margin is down below 20% (vs. 29% back in 2019). The explanation is simple.

**Reducing operating expenses is an incredibly tough job.**

When there’s less traffic (and subsequently less sales) in the physical stores, the operating expenses remain the same. The company still needs to pay the lease payment, its employees, the utility bills, etc. In fact, these expenses grow over time as there’s the impact of inflation.

Scaling down, by closing locations is also not a free option. Not only does it bring penalties for ending a lease contract earlier, but it also leads to losing all the revenue and profitability from that location.

The company is generating substantial cash flows, but I’ll argue the capital allocation is poor.

||all numbers in €m|
|:-|:-|
|Cash (January 2019)|€1.837|
|Operating cash flow|€21.541|
|Capex|(€7.772)|
|Acquisitions|(€6.559)|
|Debt|€4.887|
|Share buyback|(€2.034)|
|Dividends|(€8.229)|
|Other|€25|
|Cash (June 2024)|€3.696|

Between 2019 and H1-2024, the company generated **over €21.5 billion** in operating cash flow, or **a bit less than €14 billion after capex.**

Close to 60% of it was returned back to the shareholders via dividends, and an additional 15% through share buybacks. What’s left of the free cash flow, together with additional debt, was used for acquisitions.

Why do I think the capital allocation is poor? Two main reasons:

1. Almost 80% of the share buybacks were used in 2021 and 2022, the years when the share price was the highest (and temporarily elevated). A good capital allocator can recognize when the price is too high to buy back shares.
2. Its net debt position more than doubled, from **€7.1 billion** in 2019 to **€15.4 billion** as of June 30th, 2024. This is equal to \~60% of its market cap. The interest rate on their debt ranges from 0.75% to 5% and if the refinancing is done at a higher rate, it could significantly reduce its profit margins.



**4.0 What can be expected?**

Based on the latest investor presentation, there are three capital allocation priorities:

* Organic growth;
* Shareholder return; and
* Fuel high-potential adjacent businesses.

All of it, while having a **healthy financial situation and FCF generation.**

This is a good attempt by the management to summarize what to expect from the company. I find this slide a bit odd for three reasons:

1. On one side they want to return capital to the shareholders, which would position them as a company **with a goal to preserve capital and provide reliable dividends**. On the other side, its history is full of **acquisitions, which is the opposite of preserving capital.**
2. The center of the slide points to a healthy financial situation and FCF generation, while its net debt more than doubled in the last 5 years (**€7.1 billion** in 2019 to **€15.4 billion** as of June 30th, 2024).
3. Innovation is not a focus at all. Roughly 2 months ago, EssilorLuxottica and Meta announced a partnership in the smart eyewear category. I see a lot of potential in this area that isn’t utilized (yet).

**Growing through acquisitions and distributing dividends seems to be the DNA of the company and likely what one should expect going forward.**

  
**5.0 Dividends**

The dividend per share has been steadily increasing from €4 back in 2015, to €14 in 2024. The current dividend yield is \~6%.

If the management focuses on reducing the debt and dividends (instead of borrowing to acquire more companies), Kering could become an incredibly appealing dividend investment option.

  
**6.0 High employee turnover**

At the end of 2023, the company had 48,964 employees. During the year, there were **13,403** new hires, and **11,275** employees departed. At first glance, this is no doubt a high turnover.

This sounds bad at first, but it is really difficult to decipher.

In theory, any company that has seasonal employment patterns will hire more employees (temporarily) during peak seasons. Therefore the increase, and subsequently decrease, of employees is normal. This is even more so in industries where the work is repetitive (such as sales and manufacturing).

In addition, 59% of the employees are Gen Y (1981-1995), a generation that is known for seeking career growth, which could lead to more job-hopping than average.

Given the reviews on Indeed, Glassdoor, and Comparably, there is no indication that this is currently a serious issue.

  
**7.0 The concerns**

**7.1 Balenciaga Advertising Scandal (2022)**

Back in 2022, Balenciaga faced significant backlash over their advertising campaign. One of them featured children holding teddy bears dressed in bondage-inspired outfits. This was rightfully criticized and labeled as inappropriate.

This brings into question the ethics behind those who are in charge of product development and marketing.

In addition, given how concentrated their portfolio is in the top 3 brands (Gucci - 46%, YSL - 17%, Bottega Veneta - 9%), scandals of this kind could have a significant impact.

**7.2 Preliminary investigation by the European Commission (2023)**

In April 2023, the European Commission initiated a preliminary investigation into potential antitrust violations within the fashion sector. One of the inspections took place at the Italian premises of Gucci.

An investigation of this kind does not imply guilt, but if a company is found in breach of EU antitrust rules, there could lead to a fine of a few billion euros.

The investigation is still ongoing, and no conclusions have been reached.

  
**8.0 Valuation** 

This is a mature market that will be around for a very long time. Therefore, here are my assumptions when it comes to valuing Kering:

* **Revenue** \- The industry is cyclical in nature, so there will be good and bad times. Based on the past, I do not feel confident that Kering can take market share, so I expect its growth to normalize at \~3% per year, which is in line with the inflation rate.
* **Operating margin** \- The luxury market is getting more crowded, and as argued earlier, reducing operating expenses is not an easy task. Once the demand is somewhat stable, I expect the operating margin to increase to 21%.

Based on those assumptions (and a discount rate of \~9%), the fair value of the company is **€27 billion (€220/share)** which is very close to the current price of **€224/share**.

This offers an IRR of \~9%, which is slightly below the historical return of the S&P500.

  
**8.1 The Bull Case**

Those who are betting on Kering, are ultimately betting that there will be revenue growth and margin expansion through some of the following:

* Revitalization of Balenciaga & rebuilding its reputation after the controversies;
* Sustained growth in Gucci, and expansion of secondary brands like Bottega Veneta & Saint Laurent;
* The success of its newly launched beauty division, capturing market share from rivals like LVMH and Estee Lauder;
* Positive macro tailwinds;

* Utilizing pricing power;
* Integration of recent acquisitions;
* Reducing operating costs;

**If the management can pull this off, then the value per share could be 2x from today’s share price.**



**8.2 The Bear Case**

Those who are betting against Kering, are ultimately betting that there will be revenue decline and margin compression through some of the following:

* Brand mismanagement & more scandals;
* Inability to revitalize Balenciaga;
* Inability to innovate around its primary brands;
* Failure to integrate its acquisitions & further poor M&A acquisitions;
* Negative macro tailwinds;
* Inability to innovate around E-Commerce;
* Supply chain issues;
* Competitive pressure;
* Increase in corporate tax by the French authorities

**In this scenario, the fair value per share could be below €100/share.**

2024-11-22 13:40:58,Meta,META,Thoughts on building a 10Y high risk portfolio,"Over the past few years I’ve built a portfolio consisting of S&P, Apple, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, JPM and BRK. It has done rather well, consistently giving returns of 25%+ annually (except 2022). 

However in recent times my conviction on adding more capital to this portfolio has waned. I just feel the best days in terms of returns for some of the big tech groups may not be what they were for the past decade.

I could 100% be wrong and there is no doubt there is certain bias seeing the return of my smaller positions this year dwarfing the ones of the traditional blue chip guys if you will.

So saying all this I’m considering: 

50% S&P

10% Hood

10% Rddt

10% Rolls Royce

10% Cava

5% Lunr

5% ASTS

Quick rationale for each:

Hood: Expanding to Europe and offering very exciting new products like Hood Gold 

Rddt: Fastest growing social media, ARPU and monetisation only getting better and seeing many more people using

Rolls Royce: Slight European exposure, building low cost Nuclear plants and capturing the wide body aircraft market

Cava: Fantastic management, strong customer retention and expected to double stores in next 5 years

Lunr & ASTS: Moonshot (literally), this is just in case space works out and much more speculative 



So having said all that, what is everyone’s thoughts on this proposed portfolio allocation. Is this too risky, not enough diversification into the different sectors?

2024-11-19 22:08:46,Meta,META,"Qualcomm says it expects $4 billion in PC chip sales by 2029, as company gets traction beyond smartphones","Qualcomm said on Tuesday that it expects its push into new markets to generate an additional $22 billion per year by 2029.

Of that amount, roughly $4 billion will come from PC chips, Qualcomm said at its investor day on Tuesday. The chipmaker just introduced PC processors earlier this year, when it released Snapdragon X for Windows devices.

The latest forecast marks an important milestone for Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon, who took over the company in 2021 with a promise to get past a reliance on smartphones. In fiscal 2024, Qualcomm’s handset business reported $24.86 billion in sales, about 75% of its entire chip business.

Qualcomm also said on Tuesday that automotive revenues would rise about 175% by 2029 to $8 billion, of which 80% is tied to contracts that have already been secured.

*″*We have been on this trajectory realizing that the technologies we have developed over the many years can be very relevant to a number of different industries beyond mobile,” Amon said at the investor event.

Another $4 billion in revenue will come from industrial chips and $2 billion will come from chips for headsets, a category Qualcomm calls XR. About $4 billion of the forecast is a catch-all for other chip sales, like those for wireless headphones and tablets.

Qualcomm shares are up 16% this year, trailing the Nasdaq, which has gained 26%.

Qualcomm grew rapidly over the past decade as its modems and processors became essential parts for high-end smartphones, especially those running Google Android. Qualcomm also sells modems and related parts to Apple for its iPhones.

But the company has warned investors that Apple could choose to stop buying Qualcomm parts as soon as 2027. Qualcomm said on Tuesday that its growing businesses will more than offset any losses from Apple.

Qualcomm’s strategy under Amon has been to use the technology its developed for its handset chips, like modems, processors, and AI accelerators, in new markets, including cars, PCs, and virtual reality. The investor event was the first time in years that the company has given a forecast for those new markets. Qualcomm said its total addressable market is as large as $900 billion.

“We put a strategy in ’21, and we’re not changing our strategy,” Amon said.

Laptop and desktop chips are currently dominated by Intel, which has over 70% percent of the market, according to Mercury Research. Intel reported $29 billion in PC chip sales in its 2023.

“The competitive landscape changed between the Windows and Macs,” Amon said, referring to Apple’s move in 2020 to switch from Intel to its own processors. “We saw that as an opportunity, especially as the ecosystem did not have confidence in the existing players to actually deliver a solution.”

The forecast for XR headsets also hints at the growth potential of the VR market over the next five years. Qualcomm supplies chips to many of the top headset makers, including Meta for its Quest and Ray-Bans products.

When it comes to artificial intelligence, Qualcomm calls itself an “edge AI” company, in contrast to cloud-based AI that’s typically powered by Nvidia processors. Company officials didn’t rule out introducing data center products in an interview with CNBC.

Qualcomm suggested that its mobile chips will be able to run the kind of advanced AI that’s restricted to large server farms today, an indication that that company may benefit from the AI boom down the road as the technology becomes more efficient.

“What you can run on the cloud last year, you can run on the device this year,” Durga Malladi, Qualcomm’s senior vice president in charge of planning, said at the event.

2024-11-17 19:52:22,Meta,META,"New Nvidia AI chips overheating in servers, the Information reports","Nov 17 (Reuters) - Nvidia's new Blackwell AI Chips, which have already faced delays, have encountered problems with accompanying servers that overheat, causing some customers to worry they will not have enough time to get new data centers up and running, the Information reported on Sunday.The Blackwell graphics processing units overheat when connected together in server racks designed to hold up to 72 chips, the report said, citing sources familiar with the issue.

  
The chipmaker has asked its suppliers to change the design of the racks several times to resolve overheating problems, according to Nvidia employees who have been working on the issue, as well as customers and suppliers with knowledge of the issue, the report said without naming the suppliers.""Nvidia is working with leading cloud service providers as an integral part of our engineering team and process. The engineering iterations are normal and expected,"" a company spokesperson said in a statement to Reuters.

  
In March, Nvidia unveiled Blackwell chips and had earlier said they would ship in the second quarter before encountering delays, potentially affecting customers such as Meta Platforms , Alphabet's Google and Microsoft .Nvidia's Blackwell chip takes two squares of silicon the size of the company's previous offering and binds them into a single component that is 30 times speedier at tasks like providing responses from chatbots.",312,140,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gtlzww/new_nvidia_ai_chips_overheating_in_servers_the/
2024-11-13 21:52:30,Meta,META,"AMD to lay off 4% of workforce, or about 1,000 employees","AMD said on Wednesday that it will lay off 4% of its global staff as the longtime computer chipmaker seeks to gain a stronger foothold in the growing artificial intelligence chip space dominated by Nvidia.

*″*As a part of aligning our resources with our largest growth opportunities, we are taking a number of targeted steps that will unfortunately result in reducing our global workforce by approximately 4%,” an AMD representative said in a statement. “We are committed to treating impacted employees with respect and helping them through this transition.”

AMD had 26,000 employees at the end of last year, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing.

AMD is the second-biggest producer of graphics processing units, or GPUs, behind Nvidia. The company has said AI represents one of its largest growth opportunities. AMD stock is down 5% in 2024 while Nvidia shares are up 200%, making it the most valuable publicly traded company in the world.

AMD produces powerful AI accelerators for data centers, including the MI300X, which companies such as Meta and Microsoft purchase as an alternative to Nvidia-based systems. But Nvidia dominates the market for powerful AI chips, with over 80% market share, partially because it developed the core software that AI engineers use to develop programs such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

AMD said in October it expects $5 billion in AI chip sales this year, about a fifth of the $25.7 billion in total sales FactSet projects for AMD’s 2024. AMD believes the total market for AI chips will be $500 billion by 2028, but its total sales are currently dwarfed by Nvidia, which FactSet expects to post $125.9 billion in revenue for calendar year 2024.

GPUs were originally developed for gaming, which is lagging at AMD. AMD’s gaming segment is expected to decline 59% in 2024 to $2.57 billion in revenue, according to FactSet.

AMD also makes processor chips for laptops, desktops and servers, competing primarily with Intel. Its share of server CPU sales rose nearly 3% on an annual basis in the third quarter to 34%, according to Mercury Research.

2024-11-07 21:22:59,Meta,META,Pinterest stock plunges following weak Q4 revenue guidance,"Pinterest shares plunged 15% Thursday after the social media company provided soft guidance for its fourth-quarter revenue despite it beating the top and bottom lines with its third-quarter earnings.

Here’s how the company performed, according to LSEG:

* **Revenue**: $898 million vs. $896 million expected
* **Earnings per share:** 40 cents adjusted vs. 34 cents expected

The company said that fourth-quarter revenue will be between the range of $1.125 million to $1.145 million. The midpoint of the fourth-quarter guidance, $1.135 million, trailed analyst estimates of $1.143 million.

Sales in Pinterest’s third-quarter rose 18% from $763.2 million a year ago.

Pinterest said it had 537 million global monthly active users in the third quarter, topping analyst estimates of 532.6 million.  

The company’s net income grew a whopping 354% year over year to $30.56 million. Its total cost and expenses for the quarter were $904 million, up 17% compared with $768 million the previous year.

Pinterest’s latest quarterly earnings follows the recent U.S. presidential election earlier in the week in addition to multiple earnings reports from other tech companies with online advertising businesses.

Last week, Amazon said its ads business grew 19% year over year to $14.3 billion in the third quarter, and Meta said its third-quarter sales rose 19% year over year to $40.59 billion. However, Meta shares dropped slightly on weaker-than-expected user numbers and warned of a significant acceleration in its infrastructure expenses in 2025.

Alphabet said during its third-quarter earnings last week that advertising sales in the period grew 10% year over year to $65.85 billion while its YouTube video unit reported ad revenue of $8.92 billion, up 12% from the previous year.

Microsoft said last week that its search and news advertising revenue jumped 18% year over year as part of its latest earnings report, but the company does not reveal that unit’s specific quarterly sales numbers.

Reddit and Snap also reported their most recent quarterly earnings last week. Reddit said that sales in its third quarter soared 68% to $348.4 million from the prior year while Snap’s third-quarter revenue grew 15% year over year to $1.37 billion.

2024-11-06 23:27:53,Meta,META,Qualcomm pops on chipmaker's earnings and revenue beat,"Qualcomm reported fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday that beat Wall Street expectations for earnings and revenue, and the company guided to a strong December quarter.

The shares rose 10% in extended trading at one point before falling to a gain of about 4%.

Here’s how the company did versus Refinitiv consensus expectations for the quarter ending Sept. 29:

Earnings per share: $2.69, adjusted $2.56 expected

Revenue: $10.24 billion versus $9.90 billion expected

Qualcomm said it expects revenue in the current quarter of between $10.5 billion and $11.3 billion, with the midpoint of that range beating LSEG consensus expectations of $10.59 billion.

The company reported $2.92 billion in net income, or $2.59 per share, a sharp jump from last year’s $1.49 billion, or $1.23 per share. Qualcomm reported $33.19 billion in total revenue in its fiscal 2024, a 9% increase from 2023.

Qualcomm’s fortunes have historically been tied to the smartphone industry, where the company provides a range of chips to handset makers, including system-on-a-chip processors, modems, and antennas. The company makes the chip at the heart of most high-end Android devices, and many lower-end phones as well. Qualcomm also sells modems and related chips to Apple for its iPhones, and last year said its contract for 5G chips ran through 2026.

Qualcomm reported a 12% increase in handset chip sales to $6.1 billion, in line with FactSet estimates. Qualcomm introduced its high-end chip for 2025, called Snapdragon 8 Elite, in October.

“In handsets we delivered greater than 20% year-over-year growth in Android revenues,” said Qualcomm CFO Akash Palkhiwala on a call with analysts.

Under CEO Cristiano Amon, the company has diversified away from being a smartphone supplier and has introduced and invested heavily in producing chips for PCs, cars, and industrial machines.

“We will continue to transform Qualcomm from a wireless communications company into a connected computing company for the age of AI,” Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said on the earnings call with analysts.

Qualcomm has also made efforts to brand itself as a leader in AI, having developed smartphone chips with specialized parts for machine learning since 2017. But unlike Nvidia, the company doesn’t produce the kind of graphics processors for data centers that are used for big AI programs like OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

The automotive business grew 86% on an annual basis to $899 million in sales. Qualcomm says it has billions of dollars in business with automakers currently in its development pipeline, and highlighted it was the fifth consecutive quarter of growth. Qualcomm said that it expected automotive sales in the current quarter to rise 50% on an annual basis.

The company’s “internet of things” business includes both chips for industrial purposes as well as the chips Meta uses in its Quest handsets and Ray-Ban Smart Glasses. It also includes the new business selling chips for laptops running Microsoft Windows. The division reported $1.68 billion in revenue, a 22% increase from a year earlier.

Qualcomm’s chip business, including its handset, automotive, and other chips, which together is reported as QCT, saw sales rise 18% during the quarter to $7.37 billion in total. 

The company’s profitable technology licensing business, QTL, reported $1.52 billion in revenue, a 21% increase over the same period last year.

Qualcomm said its board had approved $15 billion in additional buybacks. During the fourth quarter, it repurchased $1.3 billion worth of shares and paid out $947 million in dividends.

> BlackRock’s iShares is trying to appeal to investors who want to diversify beyond from the so-called Magnificent Seven. The firm launched the iShares Top 20 U.S. Stocks ETF (TOPT) this month. It doesn’t just hold the Magnificent Seven — Apple, Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. It’s made up of the 20 largest U.S. stocks by market capitalization. “What the iShares build ETFs are designed to do is to deliver a tool kit of simple solutions for investors to be able to capture the growth of some of the largest companies within the U.S. equity market today, but to do so in a broader and more diversified manner,” BlackRock’s Rachel Aguirre told CNBC’s “ETF Edge” on Monday.

> Aguirre, the firm’s head of U.S. iShares product, noted the ETF’s mission is to deliver an easy and accessible way to tap into the innovation of megacaps – “whether that be in the tech-heavy Nasdaq space or, more broadly, within the S&P [500].” The ETF, according to Aguirre, provides a way for investors worried about the concentration of the Magnificent Seven stocks in the S&P 500.

> On Thursday, the Magnificent Seven slid more than 3.5% as a group — losing around $615 billion in market cap. That’s equivalent to the size of JPMorgan Chase. However, the Magnificent Seven is still up about 43% so far year while the S&P 500 is up around 20% “It’s important for clients and investors to remember that there are split views on this topic. There are many investors who believe that the big will get bigger [and] that the winners will continue to win,” Aguirre said. “There’s also another side to this argument. There are many investors who believe that it’s actually a very worrisome time to continue investing in… mega-cap companies because of just their high valuations.”",149,63,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gh4zwd/blackrock_launches_etf_that_expands_beyond_the/
2024-11-01 00:44:41,Meta,META,Amazon CEO pledges AI investments will pay off as capital expenditures surge 81%,"Amazon CEO Andy Jassy is trying to reassure investors who may be worried about the future payoff of the company’s massive investments in generative artificial intelligence.

On a conference call with analysts following the company’s third-quarter earnings report on Thursday, Jassy pointed to the success of Amazon’s cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services, which has become a crucial profit engine despite the extreme costs associated with building data centers.

“I think we’ve proven over time that we can drive enough operating income and free cash flow to make this a very successful return on invested capital business,” Jassy said. “We expect the same thing will happen here with generative AI.”

Amazon spent $22.6 billion on property and equipment during the quarter, up 81% from the year before. Jassy said Amazon plans to spend $75 billion on capex in 2024 and expects an even higher number in 2025.

The jump in spending is primarily being driven by generative AI investments, Jassy said. The company is rushing to invest in data centers, networking gear and hardware to meet vast demand for the technology, which has exploded in popularity since OpenAI released its ChatGPT assistant almost two years ago.

“It is a really unusually large, maybe once-in-a-lifetime type of opportunity,” Jassy said. “And I think our customers, the business and our shareholders will feel good about this long term that we’re aggressively pursuing it.”

AI spending was a big topic on tech earnings calls this week. Meta on Wednesday raised its capital expenditures guidance, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he was “quite happy” with the team’s execution. Meanwhile, Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI weighed on its fiscal first-quarter earnings released on Wednesday, and the company said capital spending would continue to rise. A day earlier, Alphabet CFO Anat Ashkenazi warned the company expects capital spending to grow in 2025.

Amazon has said its cloud unit has picked up more business from companies that need infrastructure to deploy generative AI models. It’s also launched several AI products for enterprises, third-party sellers on its marketplace and advertisers in recent months. The company is expected to announce a souped-up version of its Alexa voice assistant that incorporates generative AI, something Jassy said will arrive “in the near future.”

Amazon hasn’t disclosed its revenue from generative AI, but Jassy said Thursday it’s become a “multi-billion-dollar revenue run rate” business within AWS that “continues to grow at a triple-digit year-over-year percentage.”

“It’s growing more than three times faster at this stage of its evolution as AWS itself grew, and we felt like AWS grew pretty quickly,” he added.

Even Google has given up its 5% gain from yesterday. Matching the drop, the VIX closed at 23.16, and the 10-year Treasury Yield closed about the same at 4.29%. 

Should Apple and Amazon disappoint post-market today, I think a correction could be on. The main bullish factor countering a volatile election week, a VIX over 23 and high yields of 4.3% is strong earnings, especially from the M-7. Clearly, that doesn’t seem to be happening.

Meta  - Initially, it seemed like a perfunctory one percent drop on a small beat and in-line guidance, but it’s gone a lot further as Meta is down 4% to 570.

**Why the rout?** Analysts and investors panned high Capex plans of $40Bn and costly high-risk bets such as Meta’s Reality Labs unit, (the developer of augmented and virtual reality technologies), which logged a staggering operating loss of $4.4 billion 

Microsoft - (down 6% to $408) is getting clobbered for a different reason. Even as Azure grew 34%, the pace wasn’t enough, and guidance of 31% to 32% in constant currency was lower than expected. However, this is due to supply chain constraints as President Amy Hood noted that the 1 or 2-point deceleration Microsoft has guided is mainly due to some supply pushouts, in terms of AI supply coming online that the company counted on. (Read, not as many Blackwells/Hoppers as they would have liked)

""We expect consumption growth to be stable compared to Q1, and we expect to add more sequential dollars to Azure than any other quarter in history,"" Hood added.

The indomitable Dan Ives of Wedbush remains as bullish as ever…

""We actually disagree with this initial take as the new Azure reporting standards have moved Street numbers all around and a slight deceleration is totally expected by many investors with some supply constraints and reacceleration in 2H25, and we would be strong buyers of MSFT on any weakness this morning,"" Wedbush analysts, led by Daniel Ives, said in a note.",0,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ggp3pm/the_sp_500_and_the_nasdaq_composite_with_losses/

Meta said daily active people grew 5% year-over-year for the third quarter to 3.29 billion, which was lower than analyst expectations’ of 3.31 billion.

The company said that guidance for its fiscal 2024 total expense will be in the range of $96 billion to $98 billion, which is lower than previous guidance of $96 to $99 billion.

Meta said that capex guidance for the 2024 fiscal year will be between $38 billion to $40 billion, up from $37 billion to $40 billion.

Snap said fourth-quarter sales will be between $1.51 billion and $1.56 billion. The midpoint of its guidance is $1.54 billion, which is below the average analyst estimate of $1.56 billion.

Snap said its adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter will be between $210 million and $260 million. The middle of the range is higher than analysts’ estimates of $230.7 million.

The company’s sales jumped 15% year over year in the third quarter while its net loss narrowed by 58% year over year in the third quarter to $153 million, compared to a net loss of $368 million a year prior.

The number of Snapchat+ paying subscribers is now at 12 million, the company said. That is up from the 11 million it reported in August. The company debuted its subscription service in 2022, pitching it as a way for users to experience exclusive and prerelease features for $3.99 a month.

Snap also announced a $500 million stock repurchase program on Tuesday.

“Our investments in AI and AR are powering new creative experiences for our community and driving innovation across our advertising platform, underpinning our long term growth opportunity,” Snap CEO Evan Spiegel said in a statement.

In September, Snap debuted the fifth generation of its Spectacles augmented reality glasses that people can wear to see digital imagery spliced into the physical world. The new Spectacles are only available to developers who must pay $99 a month for one year if they want to build AR apps for the glasses.

Shortly after Snap announced the new Spectacles, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed the social networking giant’s experimental AR glasses called Orion. Meta’s Orion AR glasses have generated enthusiasm from employees and the company plans to attract developers next year in prelude for an eventual consumer launch.

In a letter to investors, Snap discussed the importance that developers play for the company’s Spectacles and AR initiatives.

“We aspire to be the most developer-friendly platform in the world, and we are excited to offer our new generation of Spectacles to developers as an invitation and inspiration to create new experiences,” Snap said in the letter.

2024-10-14 20:19:59,Meta,META,Nvidia closes at record as AI chipmaker's market cap tops $3.4 trillion,"Nvidia shares closed at a record on Monday as Wall Street gears up for earnings season and updates from all of the chipmaker’s top customers on their planned spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure.

The stock climbed 2.4% to close at $138.07, topping its prior high of $135.58 on June 18. The shares are now up almost 180% for the year and have soared more than nine-fold since the beginning of 2023.

Nvidia, widely viewed as the company selling the picks and shovels for the AI gold rush, has been the biggest beneficiary of the generative AI boom, which started with the public release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in November 2022. Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) are used to create and deploy advanced AI models that power ChatGPT and similar applications.

Companies including Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Amazon are purchasing Nvidia GPUs in large quantities to build increasingly large clusters of computers for their advanced AI work. Those companies are all slated to report quarterly results by the end of October.

Of the billions of dollars the top tech companies are spending annually on their AI buildouts, an outsized amount is going to Nvidia, which controls about 95% of the market for AI training and inference chips, according to analysts at Mizuho.

Nvidia’s revenue has more than doubled in each of the past five quarters, and at least tripled in three of those periods. Growth is expected to modestly slow the rest of the year, with analysts projecting expansion of about 82% to $32.9 billion in the quarter ending in October, according to LSEG.

Nvidia recently said that demand for its next-generation AI GPU called Blackwell is “insane” and it expects billions of dollars in revenue from the new product in the fourth quarter.

With a market cap of $3.4 trillion, Nvidia is the second most valuable publicly traded U.S. company, behind Apple at about $3.55 trillion.

2024-10-10 02:40:55,Meta,META,AMD AI event on Oct 10: Any expectations?,"I haven't seen any update about AMD able to improve their supply issues to improve MI300 cards, nor do I see wide adoption. A few months ago couple ""AI Datacenter"" startups shared stage with AMD about their new offerings with MI300 but some of them have quietly embraced NVDA and abandoned AMD due to poor supply.

No good news which highlights how META uses these cards and any performance benefits in training or inference on MI300. Azure and OCI clouds have some regions with few MI300 compute instances but I have not seen any customer success stories using these vs using Nvidia older generation T4, A100 and H100s. 

State of ROCm is not bad. It's improving and many have written blogs and KB articles on how Llama3 models are running without issues on MI300 cards. I read some articles of using Mistral as well. However, AMD still isn't able to demonstrate end to end solutions.

Who feels optimistic about AMD and they able to grab at least 5% of AI market in next 2 to 3 years at this snail pace? What are you expecting from tomorrow's AMD AI event?

What, if any, are the grown prospects for AMD in AI era with limited supplies for MI cards?",28,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g090wb/amd_ai_event_on_oct_10_any_expectations/

Idk about you but I tend to use reddit to find answers or opinions more than any other platform. Besides that marketing/ad revenue can be a real show stopper to continue growing if done right (cough meta and google)

I do see that the valuation is a bit rich with a p/s of 10x compared to something like meta and it's been around for 19 years so ita questionable if they can actually grow the way they should post ipo to be profitable.

Imo the reach for new users will continue to grow faster and faster thanks to their agreement with Google and OpenAi. 

In addtion, there's a level of a distruptive/moat advantage considering this is the message board of the internet for all things. There's nothing quiet like this platform.

2024-10-04 21:22:49,Meta,META,Which stock is hidding in plain sight?,"Coming out of the Great Financial Crisis, Apple was a stock that was criminally undervalued, despite being a massive brand already. Over the years, there weren’t any groundbreaking inventions (outside of expanding their services), yet the stock still managed to significantly outperform the market. Even Warren Buffett, who bought in later, snagged it at a great valuation.

Now that the Fed seems to be normalizing rates and the economy has shown resilience, I’m thinking about which companies might be ""hiding in plain sight"" today.

A lot of people are betting on AI related plays, with many pointing to TSMC and ASML as indirect winners. I get the logic, but I believe that, no matter how successful they become, these companies will still trade at lower valuations compared to their U.S. counterparts. Money just tends to flow into U.S. equities first and foremost.

Personally, I think Meta is the best positioned among the ""Magnificent 7."" The TikTok threat has mostly passed, and it could even be a net positive for Meta not to be viewed as a monopoly anymore. Plus, I don’t think their AI and AR/VR investments are fully priced into the stock yet.

Amazon is lagging the other mega caps in terms of valuation, but there’s still some uncertainty around how well Andy Jassy will perform in the long term.

Any stocks you guys are eyeing? I’m particularly interested in established companies with consistent growth that still seem under represented.


tldr: Apple was once undervalued despite being a massive brand, and I'm wondering which companies today are in a similar position. AI stocks like TSMC/ASML seem popular, but I think Meta is well positioned due to AI/AR investments not yet fully priced in. Amazon also lags but could be worth watching under new leadership.

> Facebook owner Meta announced on Friday it had built a new AI model called Movie Gen that can create realistic-seeming video and audio clips in response to user prompts, claiming it can rival tools from leading media generation startups like OpenAI and ElevenLabs. Samples of Movie Gen’s creations provided by Meta showed videos of animals swimming and surfing, as well as videos using people’s real photos to depict them performing actions like painting on a canvas. Movie Gen also can generate background music and sound effects synced to the content of the videos, Meta said in a blog post, and use the tool to edit existing videos.

> In one such video, Meta had the tool insert pom-poms into the hands of a man running by himself in the desert, while in another it changed a parking lot where a man was skateboarding from dry ground into one covered by a splashing puddle. Videos created by Movie Gen can be up to 16 seconds long, while audio can be up to 45 seconds long, Meta said. It shared data showing blind tests indicating that the model performs favorably compared with offerings from startups including Runway, OpenAI, ElevenLabs and Kling.

> The announcement comes as Hollywood has been wrestling with how to harness generative AI video technology this year, after Microsoft -backed OpenAI in February first showed off how its product Sora could create feature film-like videos in response to text prompts. Technologists in the entertainment industry are eager to use such tools to enhance and expedite filmmaking, while others worry about embracing systems that appear to have been trained on copyright works without permission.",129,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1fw5tun/meta_challenging_openai_announces_new_ai_model/

2024-10-01 15:23:05,Meta,META,The Crash of the stock market has arrived. Price/Earnings ratio just broke 30 for the entire S&P 500. ,"Almost 90 days ago I made a post in an alternate subreddit regarding why I believe the stock market will begin to crash within 120 days -- Essentially the crash will begin by the day before the election. I have included that entire post below -- and all of these reasons still remain relevant... Moreso than ever with the news from the Middle East today. Obviously the port strike is expediting things today. Nonetheless -- I think the post is super relevant, and for some reason, the moderators of WSB deleted the post after 6 hours, despite it receiving over 2.2 million views, and over 1100 shares. 

The ride the market has been on, quite simply, has been insane.

According to generally accepted wisdom -- by investing in the S&P 500, you can anticipate to double your money, on average, every 6.5 years. I'm not 100% certain as to why that's the accepted figure -- as calculating the last 14 6.5 year periods the average rate of return has been 64%.

Below is a chart of the average price/rate of return of GSPC (The S&P) over the last 14 cycles.. I couldn't easily find data prior to this..

|Year|GSPC Price|6.5 year return on investment|
|:-|:-|:-|
||
|1933.5|10.91||
|1940|12.05|10.44%|
|1946.5|18.43|52.95%|
|1953|26.38|43.13%|
|1959.5|58.68|122%|
|1966|92.88|58%|
|1972.5|107.14|15%|
|1979|99.93|-7.22%|
|1985.5|191.85|91.90%|
|1992|408.78|113%|

|2005|1181.27|4.10%|
|2011.5|1320.64|11.70%|
|2018|2471.65|87.10%|
|2024.5|5525.29|123%|

While the last two cycles don't necessarily ring any alarm bells -- we have just more than doubled, twice, looking at the last two cycles -- There is one massive, bloated, shit filled elephant in the room... Price to Earnings Ratio.

Historically, the Price to Earnings ratio for the S&P has sat just under 20 (the easiest data I could find puts it at 19.4x between 1974 and 2017 -- I'm not grabbing any arbitrary dates or numbers here). The Median value has it under 18x, and there have even been extended periods of time where it traded at +/- 10x.

Currently -- the P/E ratio sits at 28.71 -- roughly 150% of what is normal.

In the history of the S&P, the P/E ratio has hit this level only 3 times...

* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Dot Com Bubble (P/E broke 30 +/- April 2001).
* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Global Financial Crisis (P/E broke 30 +/- October 2008).
* The quarter after Covid hit. (P/E broke 30 +/- March 2020).

Images aren't allowed in this subreddit -- but if you go to the multpl website you will see we finished trading yesterday, 09/30, at a P/E of 30.07

Historically -- what has happened to the markets after crossing this mark? In all three scenarios, by the time we crossed a P/E of 30, the dam had already started to break.

* During the Dot Com bubble, the S&P 500 was already down 19% from its highs, and would fall another 34% before finally starting to recover. By the the time the bleeding stopped, it had lost 47% of its value.
* During the global financial crisis, an almost identical story can be told. The S&P had lost 18% of its value by time P/E broke 30, and when it finally bottomed out in February of 2009, it lost 53% of its total value.
* Covid, obviously, was a much quicker recovery... as we only fell 32%, and had bounced back in less than 6 months time (reason for which outlined later).

**Okay -- so** ***Maybe*** **we have a price to earnings ratio problem, but you're still not sold. What else do we have going on?**

Outside of the fact that I firmly believe that the market is overvalued today, I think there are several other major issues that we are facing in the current environment -- and while I could write a diatribe for each, for purposes of succinctness, I'll simply outline them via bullet points below.

* Credit card debt is at an all time high, and outside of a brief period after Covid checks arrived, has been rising since 2013.
* Younger Americans are in the most trouble with credit card debt. As boomers continue to retire, it will be the working class most disproportionately affected.
* Credit card delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2011.
* Auto loans debt and average auto loan payments are the highest they've been at any point in history. Auto loan delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2010.
* The stock market is insanely top heavy right now. The Magnificent 7 (Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA)) now account for 45% of the entire value of the Nasdaq. They account for roughly 30% of the entire stock market combined. As of today -- they are trading at a combined P/E of 42x. A correction in these 7 companies would be absolutely catastrophic for the entire market as a whole.
* We are starting to see a weakening of the labor market. Furthermore -- I do not believe the jobs numbers are entirely as they seem. I think many of the jobs 'added' over the last 18 months have been individuals picking up second jobs to help make ends meet. Any reasonable increase in the unemployment rate have absolutely massive consequences.
* Many banks are holding on to massive unrealized losses. While this has the potential to hit the regional banks the worst, some of the largest banks -- including Bank of America, Charles Schwab, and USAA have unbooked security losses that are greater than 50% of their equity capital.
* Regional banks are at risk due to the massive amounts of US treasury notes they hold that were bought during Covid. In short -- nobody was borrowing money to buy homes or cars. Banks, flush with cash, took said money and bought US T notes with this money so they could earn some interest on it. This was at a time when interest rates were very low. Now that interest rates are high -- demand for these old t notes is essentially non existent, as you buy new t notes that pay a much higher rate of return. If any sort of bank run starts, these banks will be forced to liquidate said t-bills, and they will have to sell them at a loss. If too many people do this simultaneously, the bank will become insolvent -- like what we saw happen with Silicon Valley bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank. (Side note -- the failure of these three banks alone was larger than the combined total of bank failures in 2008 during the global financial crisis).
* The US government still has a spending problem. Our deficit has grown by $500 million since I started writing this an hour ago.
* Global tensions are high -- and rising. Massive protests are erupting all over Europe.
* The US is involved in two proxy wars that don't appear as if they will abate any time soon.
* The political division in the US is as dramatic as I've seen it at any point in my existence. Perhaps those older and wiser than me can chime in here -- but it seems most are resorting to tribal, identity politics split down party lines.
* Commercial real estate is starting to buckle. Covid brought about work from home, and with many offices retaining those practices, or allowing partial work from home, office space supply far outpaces demand. This problem is exacerbated by high interest rates. Most commercial loans are done on 5 or 7 year balloon. When that balloon is bout to come due, the owner of that property will refinance the loan, restarting the 5 or 7 year period to avoid paying off the balance owed on the property. Many of these property owners that refinanced into low interest rates in 2020, during covid, when rates bottomed out -- are now having to get a new loan to keep from paying their balloon. However, with interest rates more than twice what they were several years ago, and vacancy rates skyrocketing, many of these real estate owners will not be able to pay the monthly mortgage on their buildings. Commercial Real Estate foreclosures jumped 117% in March alone.
* Housing has become increasingly less affordable for many Americans. For 2022 -- the most recent year I could find data -- a family earning the median US household income, renting a median priced US home, was spending 40% of their income on rent.
* Countries are abandoning the US dollar in droves.

I believe some of these issues, on their own, are enough to cause serious economic turmoil. Bundled together, I don't see how we aren't in for a very rude awakening.

**This economic downturn may be severe.**

In the three times this has happened before -- the action, or lake thereof varied dramatically. During scenario one -- the dot com bubble -- the government largely just let the companies fail. While I was only 11 at the time, my understanding is that there really were no bailouts here because the only people really hurt were the investors in those companies -- unlike scenario two. During the GFC, shuttering banks would have resulted in a complete collapse of the US (and really global) financial system. While I won't get into partisan politics, I'm of the belief that the covid bailouts were entirely unnecessary -- and more importantly for this post -- the reason that the upcoming crash is going to be so insanely problematic.

**Bailouts on any level, whether to companies, banks, or directly to citizens, will inevitably increase inflation. I don't think they are on the table for this correction.**

People have painted the inflation problem as a result of supply chain issues... And while supply chain issues didn't help, I think the bigger issue, by far, was the sheer amount of money we printed. You cannot make $4 trillion appear out of thin air and expect that every dollar in circulation isn't going to suddenly become worth less money. We just lived through this reality after the Covid printing.

This will largely tie the feds hands. Print more money -- we find ourselves in a cycle of ever increasing prices and higher interest rates.

**What happens from here?**

I don't know. Don't listen to me. I'm an idiot. Stock market will probably just continue to go up. I'm probably wrong about 100% of this.

The prediction in bold below is what I posted 90 days ago. I now believe the top is officially in -- that we won't see another ATH for a long time. 

**My Prediction? GSPC/SPY cruise up a tiny bit further, to +/- $5900/$590 -- before retreating to $3500/$350 by 12/2025.**

2024-09-25 19:42:22,Meta,META,"Meta unveils $299 Quest 3S VR headset, Orion AR glasses prototype ","Meta announced the Quest 3S, the latest virtual reality headset to come out of the company’s Reality Labs division and a cheaper offering than its predecessor.

The device will go on sale on Oct. 15, and it’ll retail starting at $299, down from the $499 starting price for 2023′s Quest 3. The device can be used to watch movies, as well as run VR fitness apps and gaming, Meta said Wednesday at its Connect event in Menlo Park, California. The company positioned the headset as a multitasking computer, putting it in competition with Apple’s $3,499 Vision Pro headset that launched in February.

In addition to the Quest 3S, Meta on Wednesday also showcased its latest prototype of augmented-reality smart glasses and announced a flurry of new features for its Meta AI chatbot.

Meta’s previous Quest devices are the bestselling VR headsets, with millions shipped thanks to heavy marketing and a lower price than many competitors, but those efforts have yet to spark a cultural phenomenon or a mainstream software ecosystem around VR. Including its acquisition of Oculus in 2014, Meta has poured more than $65 billion in expenses into its hardware efforts.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has defended the company’s spending as a strategic initiative to prevent Apple from controlling future hardware platforms.

Although there was hope among VR developers that Apple’s entry into the market would spur a wave of new apps and users, Apple hasn’t revealed sales for its headset and reports suggest that sales have been in small volumes, under 1 million units, partially due to its high price.

What it does

A Meta representative said the “S” in Quest 3S stands for “start” — as in getting started with VR.

Many of the new Meta features that the company discussed for the $299 Quest 3S have counterparts on Apple’s Vision Pro, including a mode that allows for the device to be used on an airplane and another that simulates a large movie theater inside the headset.

Meta highlighted improved “passthrough,” the term used to described when a VR headset uses cameras and sensors on the outside of the device to display live real-time video inside the headset. That function is intended to make users feel like they are looking through a display and allows them to interact with the real world while keeping the headset on. For the Quest 3S, Meta added a dedicated button to turn on passthrough.

The company has emphasized the ability of the Quest 3S to multitask and run apps, positioning it as a computing device, instead of a game console.

“All the things you can do with a general purpose computer, Quest is the full package,” Zuckerberg said.

In demos provided Tuesday, Meta showcased the device running as many as four apps at one time on floating screens inside the headset, including a YouTube video, a browser, Amazon Music and Meta’s app store. Meta says the headset can handle six windows. But the demo experience was not smooth. The Amazon Music app crashed, window controls would disappear and Meta’s controllers would fall asleep after a few minutes if the user wasn’t pressing buttons.

Besides the Quest 3S, Meta also announced a price cut for last’s year Quest 3, bringing the price of the 512GB version down from $649 to $499. The Quest 3 has more advanced lenses and a superior screen with a higher resolution than the Quest 3S.

Additionally, Meta said it will discontinue the Quest Pro, its $999 headset launched in 2022 that never gained much momentum, and the older Quest 2 headset.

Eventually, glasses

Zuckerberg’s justification for spending so much on VR and AR is his belief that the technology will eventually end up in lightweight, transparent glasses that overlay computer graphics and information onto the real world.

Investing in VR software and hardware are early steps toward those glasses, which could take as much as a decade to develop, Zuckerberg previously said.

Zuckerberg showed off an early concept of what those glasses could look like on Wednesday. The thick, black-framed prototype, called Orion, won’t be sold to consumers, but Meta says they will be used internally as the company continues working toward the consumer glasses it hopes to one day sell.

“This is where we are going,” Zuckerberg said.

Meta hopes the next version of Orion will be available to consumers as the company’s first full AR glasses, Zuckerberg said without giving a timetable for when that may be.

Orion is Meta’s first “fully-functioning” prototype AR glasses, Zuckerberg said, and the device is tethered wirelessly to a small “puck.” The prototype uses a wristband component to pick up on users neural signals and let them control the Orion glasses using their brains. That technology stems from the company’s 2019 acquisition of CTRL-Labs.

Orion enables users to play games, multi-task with multiple windows and videoconference with people around the world represented by a realistic avatar, Zuckerberg said.

Meta’s Orion prototype comes a week after Snap announced its fifth-generation Spectacles AR glasses. Those thick-framed glasses will only be made available to developers, who must commit to paying $99 a month for one full year if they want to build AR apps for the device.

This isn’t the first time Meta publicly revealed a prototype of a future devices or research projects to signal to investors and employees where VR and AR technology is headed. The Orion glasses are an improvement on Project Nazare, prototype smart glasses that Zuckerberg announced in 2021, when the company changed its name from Facebook.

Meta does sell a pair of glasses with a built-in camera in partnership with EssilorLuxottica called Ray-Ban Meta, which start at $299 and were announced in 2023. While these glasses don’t have any displays, they do have tiny speakers that allow the device to play music or interact with Meta AI, the company’s voice assistant.

As part of Wednesday’s event, Meta announced new Meta AI features for its Ray-Ban smart glasses.

For example, the Ray-Ban Meta glasses will be able to detect when a user is looking at a sign in Spanish and, if asked, can translate in the user’s ear, a new improvement, Meta said. The camera can scan QR codes, and it can also extract information like book titles out of photos it takes.

Another new capability for the glasses is the ability to remember facts like where the user parked. 

Li-Chen Miller, the vice president of product in charge of Ray-Ban Meta glasses, told CNBC that when she travels, she uses the glasses to take photos of her hotel room door, and later, she asks Meta AI to recall the number. 

Those features will become available “later this year,” the company said.

The Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses have sold more than 730,000 units in their first three quarters, according to market researcher IDC. In July, Zuckerberg told investors that they were “a bigger hit sooner than expected.”

Last week, EssilorLuxottica and Meta announced that they had extended their partnership to develop more smart glasses.

AI that speaks

Zuckerberg also introduced improvements to its Meta AI chatbot that will allow people to interact with it using their voice in addition to written prompts.

With voice, users will be able to have oral conversations with Meta AI, which is accessed through Meta’s apps. Users will be able to perform actions using their voice, such as telling Meta AI to take a photo by talking to their smartphone.

For Meta AI’s new feature, the company is using computer-generated voices from celebrities including Awkwafina, Judi Dench, John Cena, Keegan-Michael Key and Kristen Bell.

The new Siri-like Meta AI voice feature will be available over the next month for U.S., Canadian, Australian and New Zealand users of WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Messenger.

The Meta AI announcement comes a day after rival OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, announced an advanced voice feature for people who pay for its premium service.

Meta’s new chatbot features are based on the company’s AI model, Llama. Meta on Wednesday announced a newer version of Llama, called Llama 3.2. This updated model can understand both images and text, an upgrade from its predecessors which generated responses to people’s written prompts.

It gained more steam on Wednesday, closing at a record $157.10. Oracle has seen double-digit gains following each of its three quarterly reports this year, driven by the company’s cloud businesses. The stock didn’t have a single double-digit increase last year and had only one in 2022.

“The excitement is back,” Guggenheim analysts titled their post-earnings report, highlighting “momentum across all business.”

Oracle shares are now up 49% this year, trailing only AI chipmaker Nvidia — up 136% — among large-cap tech stocks. The next best performer in the group is Meta, which has gained 45%.

Intel, meanwhile, has lost 60% of its value and Cisco is down almost 3%. Both companies announced major layoffs in their earnings reports last month.

The biggest financial winner from Oracle’s rally is Ellison, who founded the software company in 1977 and remains chairman. He owns over 40% of the outstanding stock and has seen his net worth swell to $192 billion, according to Forbes. Only Tesla CEO Elon Musk ($251 billion) and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos ($202 billion) are wealthier.

By the standards of high-growth tech, Oracle remains fairly plodding.

Revenue increased 8% in the latest quarter from a year earlier to $13.31 billion. For the current period, growth is expected to be between 8% and 10%, CEO Safra Catz said on the earnings call.

Since 2011, Oracle has had only one year of double-digit revenue growth — 18% in fiscal 2023 — and four times the company has contracted.

“After 13 years of single-digit organic total revenue growth, Oracle is reaccelerating into the double digits,” JMP analysts wrote in a note on Tuesday, bumping up their rating to buy from hold. “We remain very EPS confident and committed to full-year total revenue growth growing double digits.”

Oracle is currently in the midst of its CloudWorld conference, which wraps up on Thursday in Las Vegas. Between the earnings report and the annual event, investors are applauding the company’s cloud story, including both its infrastructure business and its databases.

While Oracle is still way behind Amazon Web Services, Microsoft and Google in terms of cloud infrastructure market share, the business has turned into a big growth driver for the company. Revenue in the unit surged 45% in the quarter from a year earlier to $2.2 billion.

In addition to competing with the top cloud companies, Oracle is increasingly partnering with them.

A year ago, Ellison visited Microsoft’s headquarters outside of Seattle for the first time, announcing a collaboration with a company he’d competed with for more than 30 years.

On Monday, Oracle said its database software will become available for AWS customers to use atop Oracle hardware sitting inside of Amazon data centers. Oracle has forged such arrangements with all three major cloud infrastructure vendors in the past year.

“We believe our cloud partnerships with AWS and Microsoft and Google will turbocharge the growth of our database business for years to come,” Ellison said on Monday’s earnings call.

Oracle didn’t immediately provide a comment for this story.

# ‘No more passwords’

For years, Ellison described Oracle’s database as “autonomous,” playing into the hype around self-driving cars (he used to be on Tesla’s board and is close with Musk) and the emergence of AI. Its product wouldn’t need manual patching and wouldn’t have downtime, and Ellison said no other cloud provider could do it. But of late he’s benefitted from playing nice.

After years of criticizing AWS at events, Ellison decided to ensure that clients are able to use Amazon’s market-leading cloud with Oracle’s full-featured database.

“Of course, customers have been able to use Oracle inside of AWS for a long time,” AWS CEO Matt Garman told CNBC in a recent interview. But the new offering will allow clients to easily sign up in the AWS marketplace of third-party software, make backups and move data to AWS analytics tools, Garman said.

Garman, who replaced Adam Selipsky as AWS CEO in June, added that clients had been asking the two companies to figure out how to work more closely together.

As Ellison digs deeper into AI and enters his 81st year on the planet, he’s now taking on passwords, which he calls “utterly ridiculous” because they’re insecure and can be “easily hacked.”

“This is the way log-on is going to work,” Ellison said on the earnings call. “I’m going to type in Larry.Ellison@oracle.com, the computer is going to look at me and say, ‘OK, Hi Larry.’ We’re done.”

He went on to say that Catz can recognize him as can his kids, so there’s no reason his computer shouldn’t be able to the same.

“No more passwords,” he said. “Those have got to go.”

2024-09-10 08:14:19,Meta,META,Apple loses EU court battle over 13 billion euro tax bill in Ireland ,"Europe’s top court on Tuesday ruled against Apple in the tech giant’s 10-year court battle over its tax affairs in Ireland.

The pronouncement from the European Court of Justice comes hours after Apple unveiled a swathe of new product offerings, looking to revitalize its iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPod line-ups.

CNBC has reached out to Apple for comment. The company’s shares were down 1% in premarket trading at 09:07 a.m. London time.

In 2014, the European Commission, the European Union’s executive arm, opened an investigation into Apple’s tax payments in Ireland, the tech giant’s headquarters in the EU.

The Commission in 2016 ordered Dublin to recover up to 13 billion euros ($14.4 billion) in back taxes from Apple, at the time saying that the tech company had received “illegal” tax benefits from Ireland over the course of two decades.

Apple and Ireland appealed the Commission’s decision in 2019, and in 2020 the EU General Court sided with the U.S. tech giant. The EU’s second-highest court anulled the Commission’s 2016 decision and said that the executive arm did not prove that the Irish government had given Apple a tax advantage.

The Commission in turn appealed the General Court’s decision, sending the litigation up to the ECJ.

The case, which first began under outgoing competition chief Margrethe Vestager, highlights the continued conflict between U.S. tech giants and the EU, which has sought to tackle issues from data protection to taxation and antitrust.

This was not the last time that Apple found itself in the EU’s crosshairs. Most recently, the Commission hit the iPhone maker hit Apple with an antitrust fine of 1.8 billion euro ($1.99 billion) in March for abusing its dominant position in the market for the distribution of music streaming apps.

Separately, the EU’s sweeping Digital Markets Act has forced companies to change some of their practices in Europe. The Commission has opened various investigations under the DMA into tech giants, including Apple, Alphabet and Meta.

2024-09-06 15:18:42,Meta,META,Sen. Elizabeth Warren writes a letter backing the DOJ investigation into Nvidia antitrust allegations,"https://www.businessinsider.com/elizabeth-warren-backs-justice-department-nvidia-antitrust-investigation-2024-9

September 5 2024

Dear Assistant Attorney General Kanter.

Competition is key to a thriving U.S. economy and faster economic growth. This is particularly true in the semiconductor market, which will drive future advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and other tech breakthroughs --- the reason Congress provided $52.7 billion in support for the industry in the CHIPS and Science Act.

This is why I welcome the reports that the Department of Justice (DOJ) has opened an antitrust investigation into Nvidia, whose blockbuster growth has made it one of the world's largest companies. While this growth has been primarily driven by the recent AI boom, it has been supercharged by Nvidia's use of anticompetitive tactics that have choked off competition and chilled innovation. I am pleased that the DOJ has joined authorities in other countries, such as the United Kingdom and the European Union, in investigating Nvidia's conduct.

Until recently, Nvidia was a relatively niche provider of gaming chips, but as a ""prime beneficiary of the Al frenzy,"" it has seen its market capitalization increase by 250% between November 2021 and May 2024. The money involved is vast, and Big Tech is spending most of it: Microsoft and Meta spent a combined $9 billion on Nvidia's chips last year alone. Amazon purchased as many as 50,000 chips in 2023. And Google plans to pour nearly $40 billion into AI this year much of it on Nvidia's products and services.

As a result of this spending, Nvidia now controls an estimated 90% of the market for high-end AI chips and 98% of the lucrative and growing data center graphics processing units (GPUS) market. Its hardware has been the underpinning of almost every AI milestone, including the development and deployment of OpenAl's ChatGPT-4 and other models. Market power like that means the company decides who gets chips from its limited supply and how much they pay, with some experts theorizing that Nvidia has been making a 1000% profit through the retail price of some of its chips. This has effectively made Nvidia the gatekeeper for the world's AI future. 

But in carrying out this responsibility, Nvidia has shown that it is not committed to fair play. The company locks customers in by bundling products, software, and services a practice that has already triggered antitrust scrutiny in France-resulting in Nvidia's own programming software being the only system that is fully compatible with its chips. In a move that was ultimately blocked by the Federal Trade Commission, Nvidia has attempted to further raise barriers to entry by acquiring Arm Limited, the developer of essential chip architecture. If the deal had gone through, experts say Nvidia would have gained control over a software architecture that most of the industry relies on. As Nvidia cements its dominance, venture funders are investing less in companies attempting to build competing chips. Indeed, the number of U.S. venture funding deals for Al chips fell approximately 80% between 2022 and 2023.

The insatiable hunger of gargantuan Big Tech companies for Nvidia chips, along with the company's opaque and preferential allocation of them, are starving startup companies of the infrastructure they need to do business and crowding academic AI researchers out of the field. Allowing a single company so much influence over AI research, development, and monetization poses dire economic risks. Competition powers a virtuous cycle of rapid innovation by impelling each market participant to create the best products. It creates jobs and generates tax revenue. It reduces the need for regulation by giving the market a role in keeping aspiring monopolists in check. It reduces costs for companies by giving them a choice of suppliers.

Without the intervention of U.S. regulators, the prospects of restoring competition in the semiconductor market are bleak. They will only grow bleaker as Nvidia approaches 100% ownership of the market, and as it begins pouring money into lobbying alongside the conventional Big Tech players to shape the contours of AI regulation and lock in its advantage. I thank you for your leadership and support efforts to undertake a comprehensive and fair investigation into Nvidia.

Sincerely,

Elizabeth Warren 
United States Senator

2024-09-05 14:45:29,Meta,META,Snap sued by New Mexico AG over 'sextortion' of kids by predators ,"The New Mexico attorney general filed a lawsuit against Snap, alleging that its social media app Snapchat’s design and algorithmic recommendations “openly foster and promote illicit sexual material involving children and facilitate sextortion and the trafficking of children, drugs, and guns.”

The suit calls Snapchat “a breeding ground for predators to collect sexually explicit images of children and to find, groom and extort them.”

New Mexico Attorney General Raul Torrez, who has a pending lawsuit against Facebook owner Meta for allegedly enabling the sexual exploitation of children, in a statement said, “Snap has misled users into believing that photos and videos sent on their platform will disappear, but predators can permanently capture this content and they have created a virtual yearbook of child sexual images that are traded, sold, and stored indefinitely.

“Through our litigation against Meta and Snap, the New Mexico Department of Justice will continue to hold these platforms accountable for prioritizing profits over children’s safety,” Torrez said.

CNBC has requested comment from Snap about Torrez’s lawsuit, which was filed in the First Judicial District Court in Santa Fe County.

The suit alleges that Snap “repeatedly made statements to the public regarding the safety and design of its platforms that it knew were untrue,” or that were contradicted by the company’s own internal findings.

“Snap was specifically aware, but failed to warn children and parents, of ‘rampant’ and ‘massive’ sextortion on its platform — a problem so grave that it drives children facing merciless and relented blackmail demands or disclosure of intimate images to their families and friends to suicide,” the suit says.

New Mexico’s Department of Justice, which Torrez leads, in recent months conducted an investigation that found that there was a “vast network of dark web sites dedicated to sharing stolen, non-consensual sexual images from Snap” and that there were more than 10,000 records related to SNAP and child sexual abuse material “in the last year alone,” the department said.

The suit alleges violations of New Mexico’s unfair trade practices law.

2024-09-04 13:00:41,Meta,META,[Reuters Exclusive] Intel manufacturing business suffers setback as Broadcom tests disappoint,"Sept 4 (Reuters) - Intel's (INTC.O), contract manufacturing business has suffered a setback after tests with chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO.O), failed, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, dealing a blow to the company's turnaround efforts.

The tests conducted by Broadcom involved sending silicon wafers - the foot-wide discs on which chips are printed - through Intel's most advanced manufacturing process known as 18A, the sources said. Broadcom received the wafers back from Intel last month. After its engineers and executives studied the results, the company concluded the manufacturing process is not yet viable to move to high-volume production.

Reuters could not determine the current relationship between Broadcom and Intel or whether Broadcom had decided to walk away from a potential manufacturing deal.

""Intel 18A is powered on, healthy and yielding well, and we remain fully on track to begin high volume manufacturing next year,"" an Intel spokesperson said in a statement. ""There is a great deal of interest in Intel 18A across the industry but, as a matter of policy, we do not comment on specific customer conversations.""

A Broadcom spokesperson said the company is ""evaluating the product and service offerings of Intel Foundry and have not concluded that evaluation.""

Intel's contract manufacturing business was launched in 2021 as a key part of Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger's turnaround strategy.

Broadcom is not a household name but makes crucial networking gear and radio chips that helped generate $28 billion in overall chip sales in its last fiscal year. It has benefited from the boom in spending on artificial intelligence hardware, and J.P. Morgan analyst Harlan Sur estimated it will bank $11 billion to $12 billion from AI this year, up from $4 billion last year.

Some of its chip sales are from agreements with companies such as Alphabet's (GOOGL.O), Google and Meta Platforms (META.O), to help produce in-house AI processors, which can include arrangements with a manufacturer, such as Intel or Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW),.

**CRUCIAL SETBACK**

As part of a disastrous second-quarter earnings report that shaved more than a quarter from the company's market value, Intel announced a 15% job cut and a reduction in capital spending related to its factory construction. Gelsinger and other executives will present a plan to the board of directors in mid-September on possible cuts to business units and teams to reduce costs, Reuters reported on Sunday.

Intel has committed to about $100 billion of expansion and new factory construction at several sites in the U.S. A crucial part of the company's expansion includes attracting big customers such as Nvidia (NVDA.O), or Apple (AAPL.O), to fill up capacity at all its new sites.

Intel reported a $7 billion operating loss for the foundry business, wider than the $5.2 billion in losses the year earlier. Executives expect the contract chip business to achieve breakeven in 2027.

Typically fabricating an advanced chip requires more than 1,000 separate steps inside a chip factory, or fab, and takes roughly three months to complete. Production success is determined by the number of working chips on each silicon wafer. Achieving a substantial yield is crucial to move to producing the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of wafers demanded by big chip designers.

Broadcom's engineers had concerns with the viability of the process, the sources said. Typically that refers to the number of defects on each wafer or the quality of the chips fabricated.

For an advanced manufacturing process used by TSMC, the Taiwanese giant charges roughly $23,000 per wafer at high volume, according to two sources familiar with wafer pricing. Reuters could not determine Intel's wafer pricing.

TSMC declined to comment on its wafer pricing.

Moving a chip design from a manufacturing process used by a company such as TSMC to another vendor such as Samsung (005930.KS), or Intel can take months and requires dozens of engineers, depending on the complexity of the chip and the differences in manufacturing technology.

Betting on a new manufacturing process such as Intel's 18A is impossible for some smaller chip companies because doing so would require resources they do not have.

Intel released its manufacturing tool kit for its 18A process to other chipmakers over the summer, Gelsinger said on an earnings call last month.

The company plans to be ""manufacturing-ready"" by the end of this year for its own chips and begin high volume production for external customers in 2025, Gelsinger said. At an investor conference last week, he said there are a dozen customers ""actively engaged"" with the tool kit.

2024-08-31 08:54:12,Meta,META,I think Alphabet (GOOGL) is the most undervalued stock in the stock market right now,"I am 100% invested in Alphabet due to several reasons. I think we are in a similar situation to Meta when it was faced with law suits, reached 90$ last year and everybody said it would die. 

1. Alphabet is growing in the double digits every year since its inception. Its PE is on the way to below 20 and laughably cheap for a tech company with that growth. 

3. They crushed earnings and the only reason for their slump afterwards was their heavy AI spending, which they can easily cut if they see its not worth it anymore. Also comparable to Meta.

2. Alphabet is a leader in innovative technologies such as autonomous driving. Tesla shot up 40% or something when Elon made another promise towards autonomous driving, while Google actually is the first mover and build up a network with hundred thousands of paying users. 

3. I dont think that AI will be as useful as some still expect. But in no way Google is endangered by that. I dont have more recent numbers, but in July Googles market share in the search business grew slightly, while ChatGPT declined by 12%. I think the summarised answers in Google search are already way more useful and convenient than what Bing or ChatGPT offers. 

4. If AI presents itself as useful Google and Meta will have the best model. People misunderstand how AI works. Its not the model which is important, its the underlying set of data. With the deal it closed with Reddit beginning of 2024, google honestly struck Gold for a really cheap price.

5. Tech companies are literally what keeps the american economy and influence in the world right now alive. I think its not realistic to think that the DOJ will do anything which substancially weakens an american tech company at this point. They will probably get a slap on the wrist in a way of a (big) fine. But priced in is currently a potential break up.

6. Atleast for the next earnings I expect an ad revenue ""short squeeze"" because of the really polarized american election. Way more money will be invested in ads than in previous elections, and while the sum on its own isnt that much, depending on how elastic the ad market is, it will drive up ad space for everyone involved.",866,478,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1f5ivu1/i_think_alphabet_googl_is_the_most_undervalued/
2024-08-28 13:58:06,Meta,META,Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway hits $1 trillion market value ,"Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway reached a $1 trillion market capitalization on Wednesday, the first non-technology company in the U.S. to score the coveted milestone.

Shares of the Omaha-based conglomerate have rallied more than 27% in 2024, nearly doubling the S&P 500′s return. The $1 trillion threshold was crossed just two days before the ‘Oracle of Omaha’ turns 94 years old.

The shares were up 1.2% on Wednesday, allowing it to top the $1 trillion mark, per FactSet.

Unlike the six other companies in the trillion dollar club (Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta), Berkshire is known for its old-economy focus as the owner of BNSF Railway, Geico Insurance and Dairy Queen. (Although its sizable Apple position has helped drive recent gains.)

Buffett took control of Berkshire, a struggling textile business, in the 1960s and transformed the company into a sprawling empire that encompasses insurance, railroad, retail and energy with an unmatched balance sheet and cash fortress.

Buffett has been in a defensive mode as of late, dumping a massive amount of stock, including half of his Apple stake, while raising Berkshire’s cash pile to a record $277 billion at the end of June.

While Buffett famously never times the market and advises others to not try to either, these recent moves served as a wake-up call to some of his followers on Wall Street, who believe he saw some things he did not like about the economy and market valuation.

Berkshire invests the majority of its cash in short-term Treasury bills, and its holding in such securities — valued at $234.6 billion at the end of the second quarter — has exceeded the amount the U.S. Federal Reserve owns.

High price tag

Berkshire’s original Class A shares carry one of the highest price tags on Wall Street. Today, each one sells for 68% more than the median price of a home in the U.S. 

That’s because Buffett has never split the stock, arguing that the high share price attracts and retains more long-term, quality-oriented investors. The Ben Graham protégé has said that many Berkshire shareholders use their stock as a savings account.

Still, Berkshire issued Class B shares in 1996 at a price equal to one thirtieth of a Class A share to cater to smaller investors wanting a small piece of the Buffett’s performance.

# What could stop the Nvidia frenzy?

# Two contradictions could stymie the AI chipmaker-in-chief

IF today’s stockmarkets have their version of the great wildebeest migration, it is the stampede of the Nvidia bulls. Wall Street is no Serengeti, and Jim Cramer’s high-pitched narration no match for the dulcet tones of Sir David Attenborough. But in other respects investors’ headlong rush into the American chipmaker’s shares has been every bit as enthralling a spectacle.

Galloping sales of Nvidia’s artificial-intelligence (AI) processors have lifted its market capitalisation from $350bn at the start of 2023 to $1trn, then $2trn, and then, this summer, $3trn. In June it overtook Microsoft, an AI-zealous software giant believed to be the biggest buyer of its chips, as [the world’s most valuable firm](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/06/20/nvidia-is-now-the-worlds-most-valuable-company). It proceeded to lose that title—and $900bn in value—amid the recent stockmarket panic, only to claw back most of its losses in the past few weeks. As the firm prepares to report its latest results on August 28th just about everyone expects another blow-out quarter. “How much money have you made over the years betting against Jensen Huang?” Mr Cramer asked rhetorically on his CNBC show last week, referring to Nvidia’s boss. These days the Nvidia bear appears to be an endangered species. Or, as Sir David might whisper, “Not an *Ursus nvidiaensis* in sight.”

For every hedge fund that trims its stake in the company, another seems to do the opposite. Of the 74 Wall Street analysts who cover Nvidia and are tracked by Bloomberg, 66 advise buying more of its shares; none suggests selling. Their average price target for the stock one year from now implies a market value of around $3.5trn. James Anderson, a veteran tech investor who was an early backer, teases that Nvidia could be worth $49trn in a decade, a shade more than the total value today of the S&P 500 index of large American firms. All it would take is consistent annual sales growth of 60% at current operating margins of 60% or so, plus some plausible assumptions about cashflow. (Mr Anderson’s current employer, Lingotto, is owned by Exor, the biggest shareholder of *The Economist*’s parent company.)

Investment bankers at Jefferies, Goldman Sachs and UBS project that Nvidia’s yearly revenues will double this year, to over $100bn, grow by as much as half in 2025 and by double digits until at least 2027. By then its operating profit could exceed $150bn—a third more than Apple, tech’s most successful money-spinner, managed last year. The numbers are getting so big, so fast, that this alone should give the bulls pause. As they catch their breath, they might wish to ruminate on two contradictions lurking in Nvidia’s long-term growth story.

The first concerns its main supplier. Nvidia [designs chips](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2024/02/27/why-do-nvidias-chips-dominate-the-ai-market) but does not produce them. That falls to [TSMC](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/04/11/tsmcs-american-chipmaking-plans-grow-25bn-more-ambitious), a Taiwanese contract chipmaker that dominates the market for the cutting-edge silicon that goes into AI servers. As demand for these has rocketed, Nvidia has gone from one among many of TSMC’s clients to probably its second-biggest behind Apple. If it is indeed “customer B”, one of two that represent at least 10% of TSMC’s revenues and must thus be disclosed in regulatory filings, it spent $7.7bn with TSMC last year, up from $5.5bn two years earlier. Given that most of Nvidia’s purchase commitments of $19bn for 2025 are likely to end up with TSMC, it could soon eclipse the current “customer A”, which handed the Taiwanese firm just shy of $18bn in 2023.

Even as Nvidia’s and TSMC’s fates become more entwined, however, their product cycles are diverging. Earlier this year Mr Huang vowed to launch a new and improved AI chip every year, rather than every couple of years. TSMC is therefore in a mad rush to expand capacity, pledging to invest up to $32bn this year and possibly more in 2025. But it still needs at least 18 months to erect a new factory. And because these can cost $20bn a pop, careful discussions with clients typically start a year or two in advance. It is unclear how Nvidia’s accelerated timeline fits in with TSMC’s more measured pace of decision-making. In an early sign of trouble, Nvidia has delayed shipments of its latest chips, called Blackwell, by a couple of months owing to technical kinks.

Nvidia’s reliance on TSMC also highlights the second tension in the bulls’ case. Because the manufacturer controls the volume and efficiency of production, the only way for Nvidia to ensure that it meets investors’ bullish expectations for sales is to raise prices. A Blackwell chip will cost 20-25% more than the earlier generation, which was twice the price of the one before. Each chip is more powerful than the last, so the cost per unit of computing power is probably declining. But not fast enough for customers.

In August Andy Jassy, chief executive of Amazon, whose cloud-computing arm is a big user of Nvidia chips, acknowledged that he had “heard loud and clear from customers that they relish better price performance”. His company is investing in its own designs. So are Google, Meta, Microsoft and Tesla. [AMD](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/01/31/could-amd-break-nvidias-chokehold-on-chips), a rival chip-designer, has gone from almost no AI-chip sales in 2022 to a forecast $5bn this year. On August 19th it said it would buy ZT Systems, a server maker, helping it to compete with Nvidia’s end-to-end offering. Chinese tech champions such as Huawei, barred by American sanctions from procuring top-end Nvidia gear, may forge breakthroughs that could do to Nvidia’s market share what Chinese competitors like BYD did to Tesla’s in electric cars.

# Exit pursued by a bear

Assuming a killer app eventually emerges—which it hasn’t yet—generative ai is unlikely to become widely used unless it gets much cheaper; a ChatGPT query can cost seven times more to answer than Google search. Nvidia may soon have to choose between lowering prices to support its growth or maintaining prices to protect its profit margin. For now Nvidia bulls think they can have it both ways. The whiff of irrational exuberance may become too overwhelming for *U. nvidiaensis* to resist. ■",5,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1f2momw/what_could_stop_the_nvdia_frenzy/
2024-08-25 10:08:48,Meta,META,AI in advertising - can it justify the cost?,"Here’s a question:
Gen AI costs a lot. It will inevitably change the world, but the question is how much money it will be able to generate.


Back then when internet came and reformed the world, it has opened a completely new market.
Let’s talk big here - advertising.


Of course AI is opening a lot of new markets, but small markets. It is essentially an improvement on the internet. But how will it disrupt the advertising market? 


Population growth is slowing down. Almost everyone has a smartphone now, and almost everyone spends as much time on the internet as they can. Maybe there is growth until gen X gets completely replaced, where really almost everyone will actively use the internet for everything.


My question is at the current status of the world, is it the case of large companies stealing each others share from the market, or there are still parts left from the cake?


In limited people in the world, with limited people left to conquer, everyone having smart phone, watching the maximum amount of ads people tolerate, what’s left to get? The only way I see here is to sell more expensive ads. How can companies keep up with the extreme growth rate we seen in tech so far?


Maybe AI can create even more accurately targeted ads, with extremely high conversion rate, in which case ads can be sold for more, but still there won’t be that much more people to show more ads to. Can the ads performance justify the massive costs of AI, or it’s just the case of every large company burning up their money on AI just to cover their existing shares from the market, in which case I can’t see uptrend there, just a massive bear market.


In any case, I see Meta a very strong player here, the disruption of making LLAMA open source was just brilliant, strong on ads, and one of the earliest players in the ai game.

2024-08-19 13:12:21,Meta,META,AMD to acquire server builder ZT Systems for $4.9 billion in cash and stock,"Advanced Micro Devices on Monday said it plans to acquire server maker ZT Systems for $4.9 billion as the company seeks to expand its portfolio of artificial intelligence chips and hardware and battle Nvidia.

AMD plans to pay for 75% of the ZT Systems acquisition with cash and the remainder in stock. The company had $5.34 billion in cash and short-term investments as of the second quarter.

The computing requirements for AI have dictated that tech companies string together thousands of chips in clusters to achieve the necessary amount of data crunching horsepower. Stringing together the vast numbers of chips has meant the makeup of whole server systems has become increasingly important, which is why AMD is acquiring ZT Systems.

“AI systems are our number one strategic priority,” AMD CEO Lisa Su said in an interview with Reuters.

The addition of ZT Systems engineers will allow AMD to more quickly test and roll out its latest AI graphics processing units (GPUs) at the scale cloud computing giants such as Microsoft require, Su said.

“The main way (ZT Systems) is additive to the company is we sell more GPUs,” Su said.

AMD plans to break off its server manufacturing business and sell it once the deal closes, as it has no plans to compete with companies such as Super Micro Computer, Su said.

AMD has not yet held talks with potential buyers.

ZT Systems Chief Executive Frank Zhang will join AMD and report to AMD’s data center chief, Forrest Norrod.

The closely held ZT Systems has roughly 2,500 employees of which AMD plans to retain about 1,000 engineers. Currently, ZT Systems generates annual revenue of roughly $10 billion, Su said.

Executives expect the deal to close in the first half of 2025 and expect an additional 12 to 18 months to sell the manufacturing business.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at the company’s developer conference in March that the one-time chip designer now creates and sells entire data centers, or the individual components needed to build one. This year analysts expect the company to generate $105.9 billion from its data center segment, which includes chips and other AI hardware. Su said last month the company expects to collect roughly $4.5 billion worth of AI chip revenue this year. The company’s customers include Microsoft and Meta Platforms.

AMD expects ZT Systems to contribute to the company’s adjusted financial performance by the end of 2025.

2024-08-14 06:37:45,Meta,META,The Consumer Recession of 2023-2024 and the Future,"Alright so this going to be a long post so bear with me. I think we are currently in a consumer recession right now. Now you’re probably thinking ok but how? GDP continues to grow, unemployment continues to be stable, and the market is higher than ever right now. I am going to talk about some companies here that will hopefully give support to my theory.  

1. Microsoft (MSFT)

Now you’re probably wondering why this is the first company I am bringing up when Microsoft grew revenue and income. Microsoft grew revenue by 10% and net income by 20%. Microsoft does both software and hardware. The software parts of the business like Office, Cloud, and Services increased substantially. However when you look at the hardware side of the business it paints a different picture. 

Device revenue decreased 20%. These are things like personal computers, accessories, and other electronics that Microsoft sells and this part of their business declined considerably. Gaming revenue decreased by 5% with Xbox hardware sales falling 11%. We are currently seeing a similar trend in 2024. People are pulling back on items like PCs and gaming consoles. 

Now you’re probably thinking “yeah random redditor not everybody buys PCs/Xboxs every year. This means nothing.” 

So now we go to our next company. 

2. Apple

Like Microsoft Apple is a big tech company that is integrated into our society and the every day consumer. If you don’t personally use them you know someone who uses their products. If we look at Apples results in 2023 and we look at product sales they declined from 316.1 billion to 298 billion. Hardware sales were down across the board. Macs, iPhones, iPads, and Wearables all declined. However no what didn’t decline? Services. Like Microsoft services grew for Apple from 78.1 billion to 85.2 billion. Once again we are seeing this pattern of physical products that appeal to the middle class consumer fall. 

Now you’re probably thinking “yeah random redditor but Apple isn’t cool anymore so of course their products are not selling. So that makes no sense and means nothing in the grand scheme of things.” Ok let’s keep going. 

3. Nike

Nike is a global fashion and one of the biggest in the world if not the biggest. Like Apple if you don’t use their products you personally know someone who uses them. They’re everywhere. Nike reported a decline in revenue by 2% in 2024 and is currently forecasting a 10% drop in Q1 2025 and a drop for the full year of 2025. We saw Nike report product declines like their shoes in 2024 and it’s expected to get worse in 2025. The stock is currently sitting at a multi year low and besides Covid these levels haven’t been seen since 2018.

Now you’re probably thinking “ok random redditor but Nike isn’t cool anymore and Adidas is better and sells more track suits to the Eastern Europeans. So it makes sense why it’s down.” Ok lets look at more. 

4. Home Depot and Lowe’s

The two home building retailer giants of the US. If you own a home or have done work on your home you’re familiar with these 2 companies. These 2 companies are staples to the entire US economy. Similar to UPS and FedEx if you want to get a general look at how the economy is doing you’re paying attention to these two companies as they’re crucial to its health. In 2023 we saw Home Depots sales decrease by 3% and earnings decrease by 9.5%. We just saw Home Depot recently report their earnings and according to them they expect more pain as the consumer continues to pullback. We saw a similar result for Lowe’s. They reported a net sales decrease of 11% and are forecasting another sales decrease in 2024. With expectations being another 2-3% fall in comparable sales. 

Both Home Depot and Lowe’s stock are still down from their highs in 2021. Home Depot is down 16% and Lowe’s down 10% which was close to 3 years ago. 

Now you’re probably thinking “ok random redditor but those are boomer companies nobody cares about.” Ok how about another one. 

5. Target 

Target is a company that you know well cause you either have a mom or a girlfriend or both who spends their day there. Target is the upperclass Walmart that is a bit more luxurious and like all the other companies I mention they appeal to the middle/high class. 

In 2023 Target reported a sales decline of 1.7% and a comparable sales decline of 3.7%. Full year revenue decreased by 1.7%. The company going forward is expecting a continued consumer pullback and is expecting either flat or declines. Target stock is currently down 48% from its high with its high being in 2021. 

I can really keep going with this. Here is some more. 

1. Estee Lauder: massive stock decline

2. Ulta Beauty: massive stock decline

3. UPS (a crucial economic stock): massive stock decline

4. Lululemon: massive stock decline

5. Dollar General: massive stock decline

6. Hershey: massive stock decline 

7. Starbucks: massive stock decline

Now what is the point of all of this and all these companies mentioned and talked about? These are all companies that sell a semi luxury product that appeals to the middle class consumer. Now we are seeing the middle class  consumer pull back on these products. Maybe you’re not buying the next Microsoft PC this year, or the new iPhone, or the new pair of Nike sneakers due to rising costs in other areas. This is causing the market to price in future bad results and causing the stock price to crash. 

We are seeing a case where the market is not reflecting the economy. Businesses all across various industries are showing declines across the board and it’s only expected to get worse. Now with all these declines in other industries why is the market so high? The answer is tech. Companies like Nvidia, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Meta, Broadcom, Qualcomm, AMD, etc. are dominating the market. With these stocks continuing to increase and other stocks continuing to decrease it’s only getting worse. They have a heavy weight on the indexes and they’re causing most of the gains in the index while we are seeing other sectors decline. 

This has caused tech valuations to soar and other areas of the market to lag. Now what does this mean going forward. Are we due for a massive decline in the market where we see tech finally come down? 

I personally don’t think so. However I think going forward we won’t see the returns that tech has given now going forward. I think these stock declines in the market has presented opportunities and we can possibly see a sector rotation. For example the Fed cutting rates and alleviating pressure on the consumer. A case where tech lags behind and we see other areas of the market which have fallen start to climb. I could be wrong on this but these are just my thoughts. Let me know what you think about this theory.",175,120,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1eruoyr/the_consumer_recession_of_20232024_and_the_future/

Agencies and staff reporter

Nvidia said it was on track to ramp up production of its most advanced artificial intelligence chip, following reports of a delay in its launch due to design flaws.

Tech journal The Information had reported that design flaws on its new Blackwell chip could cause a delay of three months or more and the setback could affect customers such as Meta Platforms, Alphabet's Google and Microsoft, which have collectively ordered tens of billions of US dollars' worth of chips.

The chip giant's Blackwell series succeeds its earlier flagship AI chip, the Grace Hopper Superchip.

In response, a Nvidia spokesman said ""Hopper demand is very strong, broad Blackwell sampling has started, and production is on track to ramp in the second half.""",300,62,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ek8azi/nvda_says_ai_chips_on_track_amid_fears/
2024-08-04 16:52:31,Meta,META,My thoughts on META,"**I'd like to start a dialogue on what investors think about META - please challenge or add onto this discussion. This is a long post, so I've posted the TLDR below.**

Given the recent negative non-farm jobs report and unemployment prints, I think the market is missing a great opportunity in META stock after a great earnings report.

Context: META pre-earnings was about $470 and post earnings is now $488. They beat earnings by 8%. META is down from its high of $540.

Position: I have sold some META puts at lower strike points, so yes I am biased and want the company to perform well, but will change my mind if there's a compelling argument otherwise.

**First thoughts on the market:**

The sell-off is a correction that gives long term investors an opportunity to buy companies at a less inflated P/E ratio. I think recession concerns are overblown given the following:

* Absolute levels of unemployment remain very low
* Meeting inflation targets are important for encouraging discretionary spending for lower income populations so that buying power won't be continuously eroded and we can move past this tightening cycle
* The Fed has the ability to reduce interest rates significantly if warranted
* Reduction in mortgage rates will allow: (1) existing homeowners to reduce interest burden and increase discretionary spending and (2) stimulate big ticket purchases (e.g. cars, homes, etc.)
* Reduced bond yields means equities become more attractive in comparison. In the short run, the carry trade has largely unwinded from its highs in July 2024 and further downside risk is less than before - [see chart here from ING](https://think.ing.com/articles/jpy-peeling-back-the-carry-trade-onion/).

**META specific thoughts:**

* **Earnings:**
   * Just crushed earnings expectations, their advertising business continues to run strong with user base growth. They stated that they have seen early benefits from their CAPEX spend on AI (not sure if it reaches desired ROI yet however).
* **Reasonable valuation in the short run:**
   * Currently trading at \~25 PE (TTM) and forward PE is \~21 to 24 depending on EPS forecasts. [Source linked here](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/meta/forecast/). For context, Meta hit its lowest PE of 14 in December 2022 when people thought Meta wouldn't exist anymore due to ad spend concerns, apple privacy updates, and issues with facebook engagement.
   * Compared to other tech companies investing in AI, Meta (along with Google) has one of the lowest P/Es with a comparable growth rate. Relative to its peers, its PEG ratio is lower as well. However, I think some of this difference is explained by its reliance on ad spend which is cyclical and less resilient in downturns.
* **Long term bets:**
   * Meta has invested in long term bets in AI and Virtual reality which have yet to pay off and are considered a cost burden.
   * For example, in their recent earnings call, they've talked about using AI stand-in personas to help influencers and small businesses answer questions to followers. If they become the ""small business or personal"" AI, then they can deepen relationships with users and monetize in ways beyond ads through reoccuring services revenue. Reoccuring revenue and proving monetization of AI will give it a boost in EPS given investors value this type of revenue more.
   * I believe Meta is trying to move away from reliance on ads and provide value to users in ways that cannot be pulled away as easily (similar to other SaaS companies)
* **Spending Risks:**
   * CAPEX is large which has a future drag on EPS, but I think they can scrap their VR initiatives if needed if cost efficiency is required.
   * If AI doesn't work out, EPS growth will be harmed in the outer years (assuming near term growth is not expected to be fueled by AI).
* **Economic Risks:**
   * Short term dependence on ad spend which is cylical and impacted during recessions
   * Chinese companies spending a lot on Meta for ads - this might go away
   * I think given interest rates are coming down - hopefully any softness will be alleviated quickly.

**TLDR:** Short term business is reasonably valued and forward valuations aren't priced for explosive AI monetization. This results in upside both from an EPS and P/E perspective if there is no prolonged economic downturn and especially if new AI products show early chutes of monetization. Would appreciate any thoughts/challenges to this from other investors.",50,45,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ejzv3k/my_thoughts_on_meta/
2024-08-04 15:54:21,Meta,META,Apple Intelligence Has a Long Way to Go to Match Its Marketing Hype,"Selected Excerpts:

> “After testing the first beta version of Apple Intelligence myself, I can tell you that the features don’t yet live up to the excitement. In their current state, they’re a far cry from the game-changing technology that fans and investors hope Apple Intelligence will become.”

> “You even see some analysts describing it as **a breakthrough akin to the original iPhone.”**

> “Let me be clear: At this point, Apple Intelligence isn’t that.”

> Now, it’s true that this is just the first beta release and the company will undoubtedly improve it over the next few months. But I suspect that we’re seeing a fairly good picture of what Apple Intelligence will look like when it debuts around October. 

> “I found the ability to summarize emails to be useful: It provided an excellent distillation of the message’s content. This is particularly a perk for message previews, which typically just show the first few lines of an email. But the summaries of text message conversations — particularly for fast-moving group chats — were a disappointment and mostly useless. Summaries are also helpful in Safari for articles, but I don’t foresee that being a particularly popular feature. “

> “The most impressive features so far are Writing Tools, Type to Siri and phone-call recording summaries. The Writing Tools are essentially a well-integrated version of Grammarly-style features. It works nicely, but this is the kind of thing that’s been available on Android phones for a while now.”

> “The most impressive features so far are Writing Tools, Type to Siri and phone-call recording summaries. The Writing Tools are essentially a well-integrated version of Grammarly-style features. It works nicely, but this is the kind of thing that’s been available on Android phones for a while now.”

> “I was less impressed with the reply suggestions in Messages, which don’t immediately seem like a major upgrade over the existing keyboard suggestions in iOS. They could be a lot more thoughtful, perhaps by better using the context of the chat so far, rather than just the last message in the thread.”

> “The best feature is the ability to record a phone call and get a transcript of the conversation as well as a summary of what took place. In my tests, this has worked almost flawlessly, and the summaries have been excellent. It’s certainly a nice time saver.”

> “Type to Siri is also a nice upgrade, as is the new visual cue that Siri is active on the iPhone, iPad and CarPlay. But neither of those interface improvements has anything to do with AI.”

> “In any case, these are mainly niceties, not necessities.”

> “There is nothing so compelling yet that would make an iPhone 14 Pro user upgrade to an iPhone 16 just for Apple Intelligence.”

> “Some key Apple Intelligence features aren’t in the initial beta. [Such as AI PHOTO APP and OS-INTEGRATED CHATGPT.] These latter capabilities will likely come in November or December. 

> “Users will have to wait until 2025 to see the fully revamped Siri.”

> “But even when [these delayed features of] Apple Intelligence [are] available, the company will still be playing catch-up. Alphabet Inc.’s Google is miles ahead of Apple in applying AI to photos.”

> “Apple’s effort still **feels like a response** to the AI revolution being advanced by Google, OpenAI, Meta, and Microsoft Corp.”

2024-08-01 18:13:46,Meta,META,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

2024-08-01 04:52:55,Meta,META,CNBC: Meta’s advertising growth is proof that hefty AI spending is already paying off,"This is a pretty long article, but I think it is an important read since it answers the key question ""Is anyone making significant money from AI right now?"" Clearly the answer is yes for Meta. 

For easier reading I tried to bold the parts the discuss AI specifically.

Source: [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/31/meta-advertising-growth-proof-that-hefty-ai-spending-is-paying-off.html)

For investors who are skeptical of Meta’s massive spending on artificial intelligence and whether it will pay off anytime soon, CEO Mark Zuckerberg is urging them to look to the present.

After the company’s better-than-expected second-quarter earnings report on Wednesday, Zuckerberg and finance chief Susan Li rattled off all the ways that AI has helped the company grow faster than the competition in the digital advertising market, Meta’s core business.

“The ways that it’s **improving recommendations and helping people find better content**, as well as making the advertising experiences more effective, I think **there’s a lot of upside there**,” Zuckerberg said on the earnings call. “Those are already **products that are at scale**. The AI work that we’re doing is going to improve that.”

Meta reported revenue growth of **22% from a year earlier to $39.07 billion**, with 98% of its sales coming from advertising, primarily on Facebook and Instagram. Its growth rate was double that of Google’s ad business, which saw sales increase 11% to $64.6 billion, Alphabet
 said in its earnings report last week.

Meanwhile, Pinterest and Spotify, which are both significantly smaller than Meta, reported revenue growth of 21% and 20%, respectively, in their latest reports.

As in previous quarters, Li said Meta’s advertising business benefited from online commerce, gaming and the media and entertainment sectors, and that ad growth continued to be strongest in the Asia-Pacific region. She said the company’s “improved ad performance” helped lift overall ad prices despite slowing growth in that region.

Zuckerberg pointed to **AI as the foundation behind Meta’s refreshed online advertising platform**, which was battered after Apple introduced an iOS privacy update in 2021 that made it harder for social media companies to target users across the Internet.

“They rebuilt their ad tech stack using AI and they changed their user interface and **generated a lot more user engagement because of AI**,” said Mark Mahaney, internet analyst at Evercore ISI, in an interview on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime” on Wednesday. “It’s **showing up in the revenue and the profits now**,” said Mahaney, who recommends buying Meta shares.

Meta shares popped 7% in extended trading after Wednesday’s earnings report, which included an uplifting forecast for the current quarter.

Like the other mega-cap tech companies, Meta is **spending billions of dollars** on Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs), which are needed to train AI models and run hefty workloads. Some industry experts have questioned the outlays because so much of the investment is tied to expectations that generative AI — popularized by OpenAI’s ChatGPT — will lead to big revenue gains in the future.

‘Already seen a return’ Meta is showing that, while the bet is on major growth down the road, the company is **reaping rewards today**.

“You’ve already seen a return with Meta over the last two years,” Mahaney said.

Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA Research, agreed with Mahaney, telling CNBC that Meta has “really navigated some of the concerns and the storms” from a couple years ago and is “**clearly integrating AI across their ecosystem extremely nicely**.”

Zino noted that Meta’s growth rates are “**nicely outpacing those of its peers**.”

**Meta isn’t finished spending big money on AI** and the far-flung metaverse, which continues to lose billions of dollars each quarter. Li said that Meta expects “**significant CapEx growth in 2025 as we invest to support our AI research** and our product development efforts.”

For 2024, Meta said it now expects capital expenditures in the range of **$37 billion to $40 billion, lifting the low end of that range, which had been $35 billion**.

Li says investors should think of Meta’s AI strategy as a two-pronged approach, with “core AI” helping Meta improve its advertising platform and recommendation system, thus leading to more user engagement and ad performance that “have translated into revenue gains.”

Generative AI is a longer-term bet. Li said that the company doesn’t “expect our Gen AI products to be a meaningful driver of revenue in ’24, but we do expect that they’re going to **open up new revenue opportunities over time** that will enable us to generate a solid return off of our investment.”",267,100,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1eh89pb/cnbc_metas_advertising_growth_is_proof_that_hefty/
2024-07-31 23:02:59,Meta,META,"Nasdaq, S&P 500 post best day since Feb after Powell signals possible rate cut in Sept","The three major U.S. averages on Wednesday ended solidly higher, after Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said an interest rate cut ""could be on the table as soon as September"" if data on inflation and the labor market continued to improve.
Powell's remarks, along with a powerful rebound in chip stocks, helped the Nasdaq Composite (COMP:IND) and the benchmark S&P 500 (SP500) post their best intraday gain each since February 22.


The Nasdaq Composite climbed 2.64% to settle at 17,599.40 points, while the S&P 500 closed out the final day of the month with an advance of 1.58% to 5,522.30 points. The blue-chip Dow (DJI) added 0.24% to conclude at 40,843.06 points.


U.S. Treasury yields moved lower after Powell's comments, as traders snapped up bonds. The longer-end 10-year yield (US10Y) fell to its lowest level since March, dropping 7 basis points to 4.032%.

Earlier, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) held the federal funds rate steady at 5.25%-5.50%, a largely given outcome.


The attention was on Powell's post-decision press conference, amid hopes that the central bank chief would talk about interest rate cuts in September. And Powell did not disappoint.


He signaled that policymakers could be considering an interest rate cut as soon as September if they continued to see inflation moving quickly or in line with their expectations, growth remaining reasonably strong and the labor market staying consistent with its current conditions.


According to the CME FedWatch tool, the odds of a 50 basis point rate cut in September climbed after Powell's comments, underscoring the market's confidence that the monetary policy easing cycle was imminent. There is now a 90.5% chance of a 25 bp cut, a 9.5% chance of a 50 bp cut, and a 0.0% chance of a 0 bp cut.

Nvidia (NVDA) surged 17%, after Morgan Stanley re-added the chip giant to its top picks list following the stock's recent selloff. In addition, Microsoft and Meta reiterated and increased their capital expenditure investments, signaling further revenue upside for Nvidia. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) climbed 4%, after the world's second-largest maker of personal computer processors issued current quarter revenue guidance that was above consensus estimates.

Microsoft (MSFT) slipped 1%, after the tech behemoth's cloud business missed on revenue and its quarterly capital expenditure swelled to $19B.


Turning to Wednesday's economic calendar, ADP's jobs report before the opening bell showed private sector employment growing by 122K in July, significantly lower than the consensus figure of 154K. Shortly after, a key gauge of Q2 U.S. labor costs rose lesser than anticipated while also slowing down from the previous quarter.",235,68,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1eh18cy/nasdaq_sp_500_post_best_day_since_feb_after/
2024-07-31 20:14:03,Meta,META,Qualcomm beats estimates and phone chip sales are up 12% ,"Qualcomm reported fiscal third-quarter earnings on Wednesday that beat Wall Street expectations, particularly for sales, and provided strong guidance for the current quarter.

Qualcomm stock rose over 4% in extended trading.

Here’s how Qualcomm did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ending in June 23:

Earnings per share: $2.33, adjusted versus $2.25 expected

Revenue: $9.39 billion, adjusted, versus $9.22 billion expected

Net income during the quarter was $2.13 billion, or $1.88 per share, versus $1.8 billion, or $1.60 per share in the year-ago period.

Qualcomm said it expected between $9.5 billion and $10.3 billion in sales in the current quarter, compared to Wall Street expectations of $9.71 billion. Analysts were looking for earnings guidance of $2.45, versus the company’s forecast of between $2.38 and $2.58.

Qualcomm’s biggest and most important business is processors and modems for smartphones, which it calls its handsets business. The summer months are traditionally a slower part of the annual cycle for smartphones, because most new models launch in the fall.

Handset sales rose 12% on a year-over-year basis to $5.9 billion in revenue, in line with analyst estimates from StreetAccount, which suggests that a deep slump in smartphone sales over the past two years is abating. Qualcomm is also framing its most advanced Snapdragon chips as necessary for “AI smartphones,” such as recent Samsung models, which can run some generative AI tasks like creating images.

Automotive chips remains small for Qualcomm but the company sees placing more software and semiconductors into cars as one of its strongest opportunities for growth and diversification. Automotive revenues rose 87% on an annual basis to $811 million. Analysts polled by StreetAccount were looking for $641.7 million.

The company sells chips for lower-cost devices as well as Meta’s Quest headsets in a business it calls “Internet of Things.” The line also includes revenues from the company’s new PC chip for Windows laptops, called Snapdragon X Elite, which it launched alongside Microsoft during the quarter.

CEO Cristiano Amon hailed the Snapdragon X launch as a “milestone” in Qualcomm’s efforts to diversify. Still, Qualcomm said IoT revenue fell 8% on an annual basis to $1.4 billion, which beat StreetAccount expectations of $641.7 million.

Those three hardware lines are reported together as QCT, the company’s chip business, which in total reported $8.1 billion in sales, up 12% year-over-year.

Qualcomm also collects licensing fees from companies that integrate 5G or other cellular technologies into their products, reported as QTL sales. Licensing revenue only rose 3% on an annual basis to $1.3 billion.

Qualcomm said it paid $949 million in dividends and repurchased 7 million shares of stock for $1.3 billion during the quarter.

Here are the results:

Earnings: $5.16 a share vs. $4.73 per share expected by LSEG

Revenue: $39.07 billion vs. $38.31 billion expected by LSEG

Meta provided revenue guidance for the third quarter between the range of $38.5 billion to $41 billion. Analysts were expecting third-quarter sales guidance of $39.1 billion.

The social networking giant reported second-quarter revenue growth of 22% from $32 billion a year earlier, marking a fourth straight quarter of growth in excess of 20%.

Meta said that expenses in the second quarter was $24.2 billion, and that these expenses include the charge from Meta’s recent agreement to settle a facial recognition data lawsuit by the state of Texas for $1.4 billion.

The company reported capital expenditures of $8.47 billion for the second quarter, which was lower than the $9.51 billion that analysts estimated.

Regarding Meta’s outlook for expenses, the company said that total expenses for the year remain unchanged at $96 billion to $99 billion. Capital expenditures are up from the low range to $37 billion to $40 billion compared to $35 billion to $40 billion.

2024-07-30 20:27:24,Meta,META,AMD Delivers Upbeat Sales Forecast as It Shifts Into AI Chips,"Advanced Micro Devices Inc. gave an upbeat revenue forecast for the current quarter, signaling that its new artificial intelligence processors are helping bolster growth.

Revenue will be roughly $6.7 billion in the third quarter, the chipmaker said in a statement Tuesday. Analysts estimated $6.62 billion on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

The outlook suggests that AMD is making headway in its pursuit of Nvidia Corp., which dominates the market for so-called AI accelerators — chips used to develop artificial intelligence models. Nvidia has capitalized on booming demand to send its shares and stock price soaring over the past year, becoming the world’s most valuable chipmaker in the process. Now AMD is looking to make inroads with its own lineup, called MI300.

AMD is Nvidia’s nearest rival in the market, but still trailing by a wide margin. The hope is to gain more of the money that data-center operators such as Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. are pouring into the creation of AI tools.

AMD shares rose about 2% in extended trading following the announcement. They had earlier closed at $138.44 in New York, leaving them down 6.1% for the year.

AMD’s quarterly report kicks off a week of earnings updates from large semiconductor makers. Qualcomm Inc., Arm Holdings Plc and Intel Corp. all report numbers this week, and it comes at a delicate time for the chip industry. Investors have been selling shares of the companies after a dramatic run-up earlier this year.

>Federal prosecutors have criminally charged the activist short seller and analyst Andrew Leftwith securities fraud related to allegedly using his public platform to illegally profit to the tune of at least $16 million from manipulating stock market activity contrary to positions he presented to the public from 2018 through 2023.

&#x200B;

>“Left bragged to colleagues that some of these statements \[he made\] were especially effective at inducing retail investors to trade based on his recommendations and said that it was like taking ‘candy from a baby,’ ” the SEC alleged in that complaint.

>“In exchange for sharing his planned announcements with the hedge funds in advance of posting them publicly, the hedge funds paid defendant Left a portion of their trading profits,” the indictment says.

&#x200B;

>“By using the Citron Twitter Account to generate ‘catalysts’ — events with the ability to move stock prices — defendant Left profited from his advance knowledge that he was about to trigger such movements in the market.”  After using his influence to manipulate a stock’s price, Left “closed his positions to capitalize on the temporary price movement caused by his public statements,” the indictment alleges.

I have traded for years now, and never put a dime in any of those companies based on personal beliefs. I would differentiate Big Tech into 'innovative' companies like Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia etc. versus ones with very little innovation like Amazon and Meta. I feel a company like Meta is flooded with so much capital, they waste it on ridiculous projects like Metaverse and enormous salaries for useless jobs. Am I wrong? What innovation has Meta accomplished? What do they do with all their money?? Don't they just keep their social media apps running, how hard is that? When Musk fired 80% of Twitter, that somewhat reaffirmed my belief that you don't need many thousands of employees to run a website.

2024-07-23 19:30:29,Meta,META,Deep dive into Match Group ($MTCH),"**1.0 Introduction**

Match Group is a company that continues to benefit from the (sad) society in which we live. 

The best way to introduce it is by sharing the apps/brands it owns:

***- Tinder, Hinge, Match, Meetic, Plenty of Fish, Pairs, Azar, Hakuna, and many more.***

The estimate is, it has \~**50% market** share in the U.S. and impressive profitability.

Here's its revenue and operating margin over time:

2019: $2.1b (32% operating margin)

2020: $2.4b (31% operating margin)

2021: $3.0b (29% operating margin)

2022: $3.2b (26% operating margin)

2023: $3.4b (27% operating margin)

  
There are two key points:

**1. This is a resilient business** - Regardless if there's a pandemic or inflation, there is always demand for connecting with another human being(s).

**2. The operating margin has decreased** - At first glance, this might seem concerning, and you might wonder: Is this a trend?

The lower margin is caused by the management's decision to increase the R&D expense significantly (it was **7% of revenue** back in 2019, to **11%** in 2023). This is expected to generate value in the future by introducing new products, or new features as part of the existing products. However, it is clear that the ***the current margin decrease is the outcome of a conscious management decision, and is not caused by outside pressure.***

If the additional R&D expense isn't adding value, the management will reverse it, which will bring its old profitability back. With this in mind, I don't see any reason why the operating profitability would further decrease.

  


**2.0 The Worrisome Society**

**2.1** The world is changing and the internet has a significant impact on how couples meet. Based on a survey, more than 50% of the couples (in the U.S.) have met online. This number has doubled over the last decade, meaning **the number of dating app users has increased**. This doesn't come as a surprise, but given that the younger generations are tech-savvy, I don't think we've reached the peak (yet).

**2.2** Not only that, but the new generations are **using more apps**. Based on Match Group's investor presentation back in January 2023, The average number of apps used by individuals under 35 was **4.3** (vs. 3.8 for the average of all groups combined). I would not be surprised if this widens further.

**2.3** Lastly, there are fewer marriages, meaning the apps are being used for a **longer period of time**.

To summarize, we have **more users**, using **more dating apps**, and **for much longer**.



  
**3.0 The Biggest Concern - Competition**

Of course, every company (and industry) has competition. Given the market share, it seems as if Match Group is winning this battle, by a wide margin. Being the biggest fish in the sea, it can create the biggest network effect. The more people use an app, the higher the value it generates for its users.

The biggest concern that many have is - Meta. As Facebook and Instagram are dominating worldwide, in theory, these apps should be able to capture a large portion of the market, quickly. However, the reality is different:

1. ***Facebook Dating*** was launched back in 2019 and it hasn't been a huge success.
2. Facebook was founded back in **2004**. It has been two decades and Mark Zuckerberg has now focused on the Metaverse.

It is quite clear that targeting this market isn’t a priority for Meta at this very moment. It doesn’t mean it will never be, but the chances seem quite slim.



**4.0 Valuation**

Based on my assumptions, the fair value of the company is \~$14 billion **($39/share)** - slightly above the current share price of $34.

The two key assumptions I have are:

1. **Revenue growth of 54% over the next decade** - I think this is fairly conservative. The change in demographics, combined with price increases makes this easily achievable.

2. **Operating margin of 26%** - This is below their historical average and assumes the management continues with the current level of R&D.



Here’s how the valuation (per share) changes if you have different assumptions than mine, regarding the revenue growth over the next decade, and the operating margin:

|Revenue / Operating margin|26%|28%|30%|CAGR|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|54% ($5.3b)|$39|$43|$47|**4.4%**|
|75% ($6.0b)|$44|$49|$54|**5.8%**|
|100% ($6.9b)|$51|$56|$61|**7.2%**|

As I'm writing this, the share price is $34.

- If the company grows its revenue at \~4% CAGR, the market expects its profitability to decrease below 26%.

- If the profitability remains at 26%, the market expects the revenue to grow below \~4%/year.



Based on the analysis above, I don’t see data that supports any of the two scenarios above.

2024-07-11 15:11:13,Meta,META,"The 8 ""secrets"" of when to sell stocks. Do you have any other ideas?","1. **Everyone makes mistakes. Just be sure to cut all losses short.** Even the best investors get hit with a loss from time to time. But they don't indulge in worry as the stock drops even further. They [cut their losses quickly](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-growth-stocks-number-1-rule/) and move on. Leave your ego and pride at the door. Don't let a loss get to you — either mentally or financially.
2. **If you don't sell too early, you'll sell too late.** To lock in solid gains, sell while your stock is still going up. As IBD founder William J. O'Neil has said, ""Your objective is to make and take significant gains and not get excited, optimistic, greedy, or emotionally carried away as your stock's advance gets stronger."" Following the [20%-25% sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/) can help you do that. In a strong bull market, leading growth stocks like Nvidia, Meta, Microsoft and Apple can, of course, run longer than expected. But locking in some profits along the way allows investors to safeguard a portion of those gains, while still maintaining a position to take advantage of a continued run. It also reduces the risk of giving back too much in an extended pullback.
3. **Have a sell plan in place** ***before*** **you buy.** The real drama kicks in when it comes time to sell. If you don't have sell rules and an exit plan, it's easy to freeze and not take action when needed. If your stock is soaring, you might get greedy and ignore certain sell signals and warning signs. Also, if you're sitting on a loss, you may do the ""hold and hope"" routine. You pray it bounces back — while it continues to drop. Stay grounded and keep your emotions at bay by having a selling plan in place ahead of time. Write down your target sell prices for both taking profits and cutting losses.
4. **Don't let a decent gain turn into a loss.** If you have a nice gain of, say, 10%, 15% or more and the stock begins to decline, don't let that profit disappear completely. It's much less frustrating to see a 15%-20% gain turn into a 5%-10% profit than to see it turn into a 10% loss. You can always buy the stock back if it shows renewed strength and forms a proper [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).
5. **Don't marry your stocks. Just date them!** ""For better or for worse, for richer or for poorer"" is a noble and time-honored approach to marital fealty, but it's a bad idea when it comes to [investing in stocks](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-investing-how-to-make-money-in-stock-3-key-factors). In most cases, it's better to take a good gain while you have it. And never hesitate to separate and protect yourself from a bad relationship if there are clear signs of trouble.
6. **Sell your losing stocks first.** When building a winning basketball team, you wouldn't trade away all your top players for a bunch of benchwarmers. Yet many investors do just that. They sell stocks in which they have a good gain and hold those showing a loss. Further, they think a big gain is just around the corner. That's usually just wishful thinking. Do the opposite. Sell your losers and use that money — provided the [market trend](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-market-timing-how-to-invest-in-stocks-tracking-bull-markets-bear-markets-stock-market-trends) is favorable — to add winners to your roster or invest more money in the top performers you already own.
7. **When buying a stock, focus on both the fundamentals and the stock chart. When selling, focus on the chart.** They say the view is great at the top, and that often applies to stocks as well. The warning signs typically show up in the [stock chart](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-charts-buying-stocks-using-technical-analysis) — i.e., [technical analysis](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/technical-analysis/) — before they appear in the company's fundamentals. It's crucial to use both technical and fundamental analysis when [buying stocks](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-buy-stocks-using-stock-lists-stock-ratings-stock-screener). The same is true on deciding when to sell stocks. Focus on the chart and technical analysis, like [price and volume](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-chart-analysis-study-volume-in-bases/) action and behavior around key [moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/).
8. **The most important sell rule is to buy at the right time.** A very common mistake, particularly for [beginning investors](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-investing-how-to-make-money-in-stock-3-key-factors), is buying at the wrong time. Some will not pay attention to [market timing](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-market-timing-how-to-invest-in-stocks-tracking-bull-markets-bear-markets-stock-market-trends) and buy during a market correction when most stocks go down. Or they'll ignore the technical action in the [stock chart](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-charts-buying-stocks-using-technical-analysis) and either buy too soon or too late. So before buying a stock, make sure [three key factors](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-investing-how-to-make-money-in-stock-3-key-factors) — market trend, big earnings driven by something new, and institutional support — are in place.

2024-07-01 11:22:49,Meta,META,Meta accused of breaching EU antitrust rules over ad-supported subscription service ,"Facebook parent company Meta was on Monday accused by EU regulators of failing to comply with the bloc’s landmark antitrust rules over its recently introduced ad-supported social networking service.

The Commission labelled the ad-supported subscription option a “pay or consent” model — which means users have to either pay to use Meta’s platforms ad-free, or consent to their data being processed for personalized advertising. The service was introduced for Facebook and Instagram in Europe last year.

“In the Commission’s preliminary view, this binary choice forces users to consent to the combination of their personal data and fails to provide them a less personalised but equivalent version of Meta’s social networks,” regulators said in a statement Monday.

CNBC has reached out to Meta for comment. The company separately told Reuters in a statement that its ad-supported subscription model “follows the direction of the highest court in Europe and complies with the DMA.”

Meta introduced the new model in response to a ruling from the European Court of Justice, the EU’s top court, last year that a company may offer an “alternative” version of its service that does not rely on data collection for ads. Meta has previously pointed to this ruling as a reason for introducing the subscription offer.

2024-06-28 03:52:09,Meta,META,"Hedge Funds Sell Tech Stocks ‘Aggressively,’ Goldman Says","In a month when Nvidia Corp. briefly became the world’s largest company, hedge funds were “aggressively” selling tech stocks, according to analysis from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

This month’s net selling in the US tech sector is on track to be the largest on record going back in data since 2017, according to Goldman’s prime brokerage data. Semiconductor and semiconductor equipment stocks were the ones offloaded the most by hedge funds, followed by software and internet stocks.

Nvidia shares have been choppy after losing $430 billion in market value late last week. And, June has been a volatile month for Big Tech stocks after the meteoric rise of Nvidia, Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Apple Inc. accounted for well over half of the 15% advance in the S&P 500 this year.

The trimming of exposure by hedge funds is in sharp contrast to the record inflows seen into tech-related funds last week, which saw the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index hit its latest record high on June 18. The weight of the tech sector in the S&P 500 hit 33% last week, the highest level in about 24 years.

What’s more, the momentum factor-style investing that drove the likes of Nvidia to all-time highs this year is also faltering. Hedge funds’ momentum exposure is poised to decrease for the first time in six months, the Goldman data showed. “Long concentration” and “long crowdedness” have both seen notable declines and are at the lowest levels this year, suggesting long-short fund managers have become more mindful of a potential drawdown in those factors after strong returns.

The unwind is not just hitting tech alone. Hedge funds are now tilting more defensively than usual. Their gross leverage — a measure of risk appetite — has been declining, with North America and Europe by far the most notionally net sold regions so far in June.

“After adding risk to their portfolio in all but one week so far this year, trading flows from recent sessions point to some risk unwinds, driven by long sales and to a lesser extent short covers,” Goldman wrote in a note.

2024-06-24 11:03:10,Meta,META,European Union regulators accuse Apple of breaching the bloc's tech rules ,"European Union regulators on Monday said that Apple is in breach of sweeping new tech rules because it does not allow customers of its App Store to be steered to alternatives.

The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, also said it had opened a new probe into Apple into new contractual terms with developers.

The EU opened an investigation into Apple, Alphabet and Meta in March under a landmark new law known as the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which aims to reel in the power of Big Tech firms. So-called anti-steering rules were one of the big areas of focus of the probe. Under the DMA, tech firms are not allowed to block businesses from telling their users about cheaper options for their products or about subscriptions outside of an app store.

On Monday, regulators said in their preliminary findings that Apple was in breach of the DMA because its App Store rules “prevent app developers from freely steering consumers to alternative channels for offers and content.”

CNBC has reached out to Apple for comment.

Apple only allows steering through a system where app developers can provide a link that sends users to a webpage where they can then purchase content, such as a subscription, according to the Commission. However, this process is “subject to several restrictions imposed by Apple that prevent app developers from communicating, promoting offers and concluding contracts through the distribution channel of their choice,” the Commission noted.

The regulators also said that the fees Apple charges developers for the initial acquisition of new customers via the App Store “go beyond what is strictly necessary.” The Commission did not disclose what represents a “strictly necessary” fee.

Apple could face fines of up to 10% of the company’s total worldwide annual turnover, if it is found in breach of the DMA.

The U.S. tech giant has been in EU’s crosshairs this year. Regulators hit Apple with a 1.8 billion euro ($1.93 billion) antitrust fine in March for abusing its dominant position in the market for the distribution of music streaming apps. The steering rules were also a focus in that investigation.

EU opens another DMA probe

Apple made some big changes to its App Store in the EU this year in anticipation of the DMA. The Cupertino giant now allows apps to be downloaded from websites, as well as third-party app stores on its devices.

But the Commission also raised concerns about some of Apple’s new practices.

Apple still charges a “core technology fee” of 50 euro cents ($0.54) per app installed for downloads outside its own App Store. The Commission said it is looking into whether this complies with the DMA.

Regulators are also looking at whether the steps Apple makes users take to download alternative app stores or apps comply with the bloc’s rules.

The Commission will also look at whether “eligibility requirements related to the ability to offer alternative app stores or directly distribute apps from the web on iPhones” is also in compliance with the tech law.

2024-06-22 17:12:40,Meta,META,"Apple Intelligence won't launch in EU in 2024 due to antitrust rules, company says ","Apple said Friday it won’t release three recently announced features, including its flagship “Apple Intelligence” AI product, in the European Union in 2024 due to “regulatory uncertainties” stemming from the bloc’s Digital Markets Act antitrust regulation.

Apple said in a statement that the features — Apple Intelligence, iPhone Mirroring, and enhancements to its SharePlay screen-sharing product — won’t be available to EU customers due to Apple’s belief “that the interoperability requirements of the DMA could force us to compromise the integrity of our products in ways that risk user privacy and data security.”

The EU passed the DMA in 2023, spurred by concerns that a handful of major technology companies such as Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and TikTok parent ByteDance were acting as “gatekeepers” in preventing smaller firms from competing. Among other things, DMA requires that basic functionalities work across competing devices and ecosystems.

The interoperability requirements apply to iPhones and iPads. But Macs are affected by the DMA because iPhone Mirroring allows users to replicate the screen of an iPhone on the screen of a Mac.

The loss of the company’s AI product could be a disappointment to consumers. Apple Intelligence can proofread writing or even rewrite it in a friendly or professional tone. It can create custom emoji called Genmoji, search through an iPhone for specific messages from someone, summarize and transcribe phone calls and show priority notifications. The company also announced a partnership with OpenAI and a roadmap to other models being added to the platform.

Apple shares were largely flat on the news. Apple saw 2023 net sales of $94.3 billion in Europe, just under a quarter of its worldwide net sales. Apple Intelligence also won’t be available in Greater China, which accounted for $72.6 billion of its 2023 sales.

The company said it will work with the European Union “in an attempt to find a solution that would enable us to deliver these features to our EU customers without compromising their safety.”

What I would like to ask is that if I’m over indexed on tech and it’s doing well, it still won’t be called a diversified portfolio. So how would you rate a strategy where I take profits from an Nvidia or Meta and reinvest it in SPY or an all world ETF. I’m thinking that way I’ve reduced the risk for myself but also haven’t liquidated the positions entirely. Especially keen to hear - Has anyone else used this strategy? How has it worked for you?

2024-06-18 17:07:58,Meta,META,Nvidia passes Microsoft in market cap to become most valuable public company ,"Nvidia, long known in the niche gaming community for its graphics chips, is now the most valuable public company in the world.

Shares of the chipmaker climbed 3.2% in mid-day trading on Tuesday, lifting the company’s market cap to $3.33 trillion, surpassing Microsoft. Earlier this month, Nvidia hit a $3 trillion market cap for the first time, and passed Apple.

Nvidia shares are up more than 170% so far this year, and took a leg higher after the company reported first-quarter earnings in May. The stock has multiplied by more than nine-fold since the end of 2022, a rise that’s coincided with the emergence of generative artificial intelligence.

Nvidia has about 80% of the market for AI chips used in data centers, a business that’s ballooned as OpenAI, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and others have raced to snap up the processors needed to build AI models and run increasingly large workloads.

For the most recent quarter, revenue in Nvidia’s data center business rose 427% from a year earlier to $22.6 billion, accounting for about 86% of the company’s total sales.

Founded in 1991, Nvidia spent its first few decades primarily as a hardware company that sold chips for gamers to run 3D titles. It’s also dabbled in cryptocurrency mining chips and cloud gaming subscriptions.

But over the past two years, Nvidia shares have skyrocketed as Wall Street came to recognize the company’s technology as the engine behind an explosion in AI that shows no signs of slowing. The rally has lifted co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang’s net worth to more than $117 billion, making him the 11th wealthiest person in the world, according to Forbes.

Microsoft shares are up about 20% so far this year. The software giant has also been a major beneficiary of the AI boom, after it took a significant stake in OpenAI and integrated the startup’s AI models into its most important products, including Office and Windows. Microsoft is one of the biggest buyers of Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) for its Azure cloud service. The company just released a new generation of laptops that are designed to run its AI models, called Copilot+.

Nvidia is a newcomer to the title of most valuable U.S. company. For the past few years, Apple and Microsoft have been trading the title.

Nvidia’s ascent has been so rapid that the company has yet to be added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a benchmark of 30 stocks that’s historically included the most valuable U.S. companies. Alongside its earnings release last month, Nvidia announced a 10-for-1 stock split, which went into effect on Jan. 7.

The split gives Nvidia a better shot at being added to the Dow, which is a price-weighted index, meaning that companies with higher stock prices — rather than market caps — have outsized influence on the benchmark.

2024-06-09 15:11:21,Meta,META,Bear Case: Why I believe Alphabet will do everything right and still lose,"Alphabet will excel in the AI and automation sectors, but the resulting industry shift will be a net loss for the M7 company as AI eats into its search revenue.

With the ""Attention is all you need"" paper Alphabet has already etched itself into AI history. Its cloud computing arm is keeping up with AWS and Azure. Waymo threatens to eat Tesla's lunch. Its TPU may very well knock Nvidia off its perch.

But even if all that happens, it won't make up for the losses to its search business when AI chatbots take over many of the functions of search. Despite all the efforts into diversification, more than half of Alphabet's revenue still comes from search. So if people turn to Chat-GPT instead of Google as the primary web surfing tool, Alphabet will take a big hit to its most important segment. If GPT can give me the results I want, plus summaries and links and review aggregates, all on voice command, why would I ever need to go on Google and get exposed to its sponsored results? The OAI partnership with Apple may signal the beginning of this shift.

Much of Alphabet's valuation comes from its ridiculous dominance in search. All of its other ventures face stiff competition from other M7 companies and OAI, and I have a hard time believing Alphabet will crush them the way it crushed Yahoo.

Ultimately, Alphabet stands to lose heavily early in the AI revolution. The company will survive, but without a massive moat in a crucial industry, it may go the way of Netflix and lose its elite status among the likes of META, MSFT, and NVDA.",287,245,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1dbvyv3/bear_case_why_i_believe_alphabet_will_do/
2024-06-06 01:17:01,Meta,META,A tale of two markets: Jobs market vs Stock market,"Its a coin flip whether the Fed will cuts rates next week or next month but my guess is they will in July, due to peer pressure. Everyone else is doing it. The Fed's  mandate is to promote maximum employment and stable prices. Price have stabilized but unemployment is getting weaker even though the stock market is rocketing higher.

The employment picture

-Job openings are declining every month. In March 2022 at peak there were 12,182,000 job openings, in April 2024 there were 8,059,000. That's a 34% decline in 2 years. I'm curious how many of the 8M openings are real jobs, actually looking for a candidate or if the recruiter forgot to take down the opening or if they are trying to keep a pulse on the current conditions without the intent of hiring someone.

The data for the stock market speaks for itself, most of the narrative has been around AI driving the gains, mostly because there isn't anything else exciting going on. Im sure at some point in the next decade we'll start to see all the AI spending show up in the earnings. Im not sure how though when most AI services are FREE. But i think for now we have seen peak earnings, i don't see how a weakening jobs market benefits the stock market earnings. Jobs fuel earnings and consumer spending and good earnings make stock prices go up(most of the time).

Dow Jones Industrial Average- Past Year: +15%

SP 500- Past Year:+24%

NASDAQ100- +30%

I think the Fed will cut rates soon because AI is disrupting the job market making their policy stance more complicated. Its not just about inflation they have a duel mandate. I think that's why Canada cut their rate today and the ECB will cut as well. They can see  whats coming on the horizon and its time to steer the ship left or hit an iceberg.

Good example of what happening in the job market, AI is slowly coming into the workplace, replacing workers with bots. We've also seen consistent layoffs at big tech companies that have coveted high paying roles(Google, META, Microsoft, Amazon). These high paying jobs going away will have tickle down effects in the economy. AI hasn't even been fully deployed yet.

2024-06-05 19:11:27,Meta,META,Nvidia briefly passes $3 trillion market cap on back of AI boom ,"Nvidia surpassed $3 trillion in market cap during intraday trading on Wednesday as investors continue to clamor for the company making most of the chips powering the AI boom.

Nvidia shares were up more than 4% to $1,219 at one point during intraday trading on Wednesday.

Nvidia’s milestone is the latest stunning mark in a run where the stock price has gone parabolic as investors bet on artificial intelligence. Shares are up over 3,224% over the last five years. It will split its stock 10-1 later this month.

Apple was the first U.S. company to reach a $3 trillion market cap in January 2022. Microsoft hit $3 trillion in market value in January 2024.

In May, Nvidia reported first-quarter earnings that suggested demand for the company’s pricey and powerful AI chips, often called GPUs, showed no sign of slowing down. Nvidia reported overall sales of $26 billion, more than triple what the company reported a year ago. Nvidia also beat Wall Street expectations for sales and earnings and said it would report revenue of about $28 billion in the current quarter.

Nvidia shares have surged in recent years, powered by the tech industry’s need for its chips, which are used to develop and deploy big artificial intelligence models like the one at the heart of OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

Companies such as Google, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and OpenAI are buying billions of dollars of Nvidia’s graphics processing units.

2024-06-04 13:03:00,Meta,META,Elon Musk ordered Nvidia to ship AI chips reserved for Tesla to X and xAI ,"Elon Musk claims he can grow Tesla into “a leader in AI & robotics,” an ambition that he’s said will require a lot of pricey processors from Nvidia to build up its infrastructure.

On Tesla’s first-quarter earnings call in April, Musk said the electric vehicle company will increase the number of active H100s — Nvidia’s flagship artificial intelligence chip — from 35,000 to 85,000 by the end of this year. He also wrote in a post on X a few days later that Tesla would spend $10 billion this year “in combined training and inference AI.”

But emails written by Nvidia senior staff and widely shared inside the company suggest that Musk presented an exaggerated picture of Tesla’s procurement to shareholders. Correspondence from Nvidia staffers also indicates that Musk diverted a sizable shipment of AI processors that had been reserved for Tesla to his social media company X, formerly known as Twitter.

By ordering Nvidia to let privately held X jump the line ahead of Tesla, Musk pushed back the automaker’s receipt of more than $500 million in graphics processing units, or GPUs, by months, likely adding to delays in setting up the supercomputers Tesla says it needs to develop autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots.

“Elon prioritizing X H100 GPU cluster deployment at X versus Tesla by redirecting 12k of shipped H100 GPUs originally slated for Tesla to X instead,” an Nvidia memo from December said. “In exchange, original X orders of 12k H100 slated for Jan and June to be redirected to Tesla.”

A more recent Nvidia email, from late April, said Musk’s comment on the first-quarter Tesla call “conflicts with bookings” and that his April post on X about $10 billion in AI spending also “conflicts with bookings and FY 2025 forecasts.” The email referenced news about Tesla’s ongoing, drastic layoffs and warned that headcount reductions could cause further delays with an “H100 project” at Tesla’s Texas Gigafactory.

The new information from the emails, read by CNBC, highlights an escalating conflict between Musk and some agitated Tesla shareholders who question whether the billionaire CEO is fulfilling his obligations to Tesla while also running a collection of other companies that require his attention, resources and hefty amounts of capital.

A spokesperson for Nvidia declined to comment for this story. Musk and representatives for X and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.

Critics have said Musk is only a part-time CEO of Tesla, the company responsible for the vast majority of his wealth. Musk is also the CEO of aerospace company SpaceX, the founder of brain-computer interface startup Neuralink and tunneling venture The Boring Co. He also owns X, which he acquired for $44 billion in late 2022, when it was still called Twitter. He launched his AI startup, xAI, in 2023.

X and xAI are tightly intertwined. In a post on X in November, Musk wrote, “X Corp investors will own 25% of xAI.” Additionally, xAI uses some capacity in X data centers to run some of its training and inference for the large language models behind its chatbot, called Grok, CNBC has learned.

Musk has pitched Grok, originally named Truth GPT, as a politically incorrect chatbot with “a rebellious streak” and a would-be competitor to OpenAI’s ChatGPT and other generative AI services.

While Musk juggles his many ventures, Tesla shareholders have reason for concern. The company is in the midst of a troubling sales decline due in part to its aging lineup of electric vehicles and increased competition. Its reputation has also suffered in the U.S., according to the Axios Harris Poll 100 survey, which attributed some of the slippage to Musk’s “antics” and “political rants.”

Tesla’s stock price is down 29% this year.

Rather than discuss EV sales or the massive restructuring underway at Tesla, Musk has been encouraging investors to focus on future products that he’s been promising for years but has yet to deliver. That includes AI software to turn existing cars into self-driving vehicles, dedicated robotaxis that can make money for their owners, and a driverless transportation network.

“If somebody doesn’t believe Tesla’s going to solve autonomy, I think they should not be an investor in the company,” Musk said on the April earnings call. “We will, and we are.”

To get there, he’s said, Tesla requires plenty of Nvidia’s GPUs which are specialized for AI training and workloads. Those chips are in limited supply due to soaring demand from Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI and others.

‘Consuming every GPU that’s out there’

Nvidia, now the third-most-valuable company in the world with a $2.8 trillion market cap, has said it’s hard to keep up with demand. Between the cloud service providers and the companies developing AI models, customers “are consuming every GPU that’s out there,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on an earnings call in May, after the chipmaker reported its third straight quarter of more than 200% revenue growth.

Huang also said, on an earnings call in February, that Nvidia does its best to “allocate fairly and to avoid allocating unnecessarily,” adding “why allocate something when the data center’s not ready?”

In naming customers that are already using Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell platform, Huang mentioned xAI on the May call alongside six of the biggest tech companies on the planet as well as Tesla.

Musk likes to tout his infrastructure spending at both companies.

At Tesla, Musk has promised to build a $500 million “Dojo” supercomputer in Buffalo, New York, and a “super dense, water-cooled supercomputer cluster” at the company’s factory in Austin, Texas. The technology would potentially help Tesla develop the computer vision and LLMs needed for robots and autonomous vehicles.

At xAI, which is racing to compete with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google and others in developing generative AI products, Musk is also seeking to build “the world’s largest GPU cluster” in North Dakota, with some capacity online in June, according to an internal Nvidia email from February.

The memo described a “Musk mandate” to make all 100,000 chips available to xAI by the end of 2024. It noted that the LLM behind xAI’s Grok was relying on Amazon and Oracle cloud infrastructure, with X providing additional data center capacity.

The Information previously reported some details of xAI’s data center ambitions.

On May 26, xAI said it closed a $6 billion financing round led by many of the same investors who funded Musk’s Twitter takeover. The company was incorporated in March 2023, but Tesla didn’t disclose its formation at the time, and it was four months later before Musk publicly introduced the startup.

Conflicts of interest

While Musk has said for years that Tesla is a leader in AI, he wrote in a post on X in January that he’d want more control over the company before pushing further in that direction.

“I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control. Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can’t be overturned,” he said in the post.

Tesla’s latest proxy filing indicates Musk has 20.5% of the company’s outstanding shares, a figure that includes options awarded to Musk as part of his unprecedented 2018 CEO pay package. A Delaware court has ordered that compensation to be rescinded. Post-trial proceedings are ongoing and subject to appeal.

If he is unable to reach his desired ownership mark, Musk said in the January post, he “would prefer to build products outside of Tesla.” He’s already doing that at xAI.

Musk’s comments at the time rankled some longstanding bulls, including the company’s largest retail shareholder, Leo Koguan, and Gerber Kawasaki’s Ross Gerber, who characterized his demand as “blackmail.”

Joel Fleming, a securities litigator at Equity Litigation Group, said that by letting his private companies skip ahead of Tesla in procuring critical hardware, Musk is making his conflicts of interest readily apparent.

“When you have someone like Mr. Musk who is a fiduciary to multiple companies, the law recognizes this creates conflict,” Fleming said. “If you owe fiduciary duties to two or more companies that are competing over the same things, you may end up channeling corporate opportunity away from one company to another.”

Fleming, who frequently represents public company investors in shareholder disputes, said that in such situations, other executives would be in the best position to make decisions, while those who are conflicted should abstain.

“That has not historically been the path that Mr. Musk has chosen for himself,” Fleming said.

Musk hasn’t been shy about intermingling corporate resources among his companies.

For example, following his buyout of Twitter, Musk enlisted dozens of Autopilot software engineers and other technical and administrative employees from Tesla to help him make sweeping changes at the company. Some employees even work for two Musk companies at once.

At xAI, Musk has also attracted employees away from Tesla, including machine-learning scientist Ethan Knight, and at least four other former Tesla employees who had been involved in Autopilot and big data projects there before joining the startup.

A former Tesla supply chain analyst, who asked not to be named in order to discuss sensitive matters, told CNBC that Musk has always considered his companies as an extension of his persona and believed he can do whatever he wants with them. That includes Tesla’s 2016 acquisition of SolarCity, where he was chairman and a top shareholder.

However, the person said, redirecting a large shipment of chips from Tesla to X is extreme, given the scarcity of Nvidia’s technology. The decision means the automaker willingly gave up precious time that could have been used to build out its supercomputer cluster in Texas or New York and advance the models behind its self-driving software and robotics.

2024-06-04 05:50:15,Meta,META,"Microsoft confirms mixed reality layoffs, will keep selling HoloLens 2 ","Microsoft will lay off some employees who work on mixed reality, a spokesperson told CNBC on Monday. Although the cuts will affect the department that contributes to the HoloLens 2 augmented reality headset, Microsoft plans to continue selling the device.

The reduction comes a year after the software maker said it would make changes to its hardware lineup as part of a round of layoffs that hit 10,000 employees, including some in mixed reality. In the following months, Microsoft discontinued several keyboard models, causing frustration for some dedicated customers.

“Earlier today we announced a restructuring of the Microsoft’s Mixed Reality organization,” the spokesperson said in an email. “We remain fully committed to the Department of Defense’s IVAS program and will continue to deliver cutting edge technology to support our soldiers. In addition, we will continue to invest in W365 to reach the broader Mixed Reality hardware ecosystem. We will continue to sell HoloLens 2 while supporting existing HoloLens 2 customers and partners.”

Altogether, the company is letting go of over 1,000 people, including in mixed reality, a person familiar with the matter said.

Microsoft has not found great success with the HoloLens since its introduction in 2015. But the U.S. Defense Department gave a contract to the company for a modified HoloLens named the Integrated Visual Augmentation System. Soldiers who used the devices, however, reported dealing with nausea and other conditions, Bloomberg reported. Tests suggested that an updated model looked promising.

Since then, Microsoft and its highly valued technology peers have poured billions into commercializing artificial intelligence. Microsoft has raced to deploy Nvidia graphics processing units so people can use a Copilot chatbot and Microsoft-backed OpenAI’s popular ChatGPT. Premium AI features in Microsoft 365 productivity applications can write memos, draft presentations and summarize meetings.

In December, Microsoft further reduced investment in augmented reality and virtual reality, which blocks out the surrounding world, when it deprecated Windows Mixed Reality, which included tools for running applications in head-mounted displays.

The spokesperson said Microsoft will keep selling the HoloLens 2 headset that was released in 2019 but did not indicate that a new model would be coming. Insider reported in 2022 that the company had canceled a third version.

Apple brought out its own augmented reality headset, the Vision Pro, in January.

Microsoft continues to support a feature called Mesh that lets people in headsets participate in three-dimensional Teams video calls with colleagues. At the Microsoft Ignite conference in Seattle in November, CEO Satya Nadella said the company was “reimagining the way employees come together and connect using any device, whether it’s their PC, HoloLens, or Meta Quest.”

2024-05-22 13:15:17,Meta,META,Amazon plans to give Alexa an AI overhaul — and a monthly subscription price ,"Amazon is upgrading its decade-old Alexa voice assistant with generative artificial intelligence and plans to charge a monthly subscription fee to offset the cost of the technology, according to people with knowledge of Amazon’s plans. 

The Seattle-based tech and retail giant will launch a more conversational version of Alexa later this year, potentially positioning it to better compete with new generative AI-powered chatbots from companies including Google and OpenAI, according to two sources familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions were private. Amazon’s subscription for Alexa will not be included in the $139 per year Prime offering, and Amazon has not yet nailed down the price point, one source said.

Amazon declined to comment on its plans for Alexa. 

While Amazon wowed consumers with Alexa’s voice-driven tasks in 2014, its capabilities could seem old-fashioned amid recent leaps in artificial intelligence. Last week, OpenAI announced GPT-4o, with the capability for two-way conversations that can go significantly deeper than Alexa. For example, it can translate conversations into different languages in real time. Google launched a similar generative-AI-powered voice feature for Gemini. 

Some interpreted last week’s announcements as a threat to Alexa and Siri, Apple’s voice assistant feature for iPhones. NYU professor Scott Galloway called the updates the “Alexa and Siri killers” on his recent podcast. Many people use Alexa and Siri for basic tasks, such as setting timers or alarms and announcing the weather.

The development of new AI chatbots in recent months has increased the pressure internally on a division that was once seen as a darling of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, according to the sources — but has been subject to strict profit imperatives since his departure. 

Three former employees pointed to Bezos’ early obsession with Alexa, describing it as the Amazon founder’s passion project. Attention from Bezos resulted in more dollars and less pressure to make a return on those dollars immediately.

That changed when Andy Jassy took over as CEO in 2021, according to three sources. Jassy was charged with right-sizing Amazon’s business during the pandemic, and Alexa became less of a priority internally, they said. Jassy has been privately underwhelmed with what modern-day Alexa is capable of, according to one person. The Alexa team worried they had invented an expensive alarm clock, weather machine and way to play Spotify music, one source said.  

For instance, Jassy, an avid sports fan, asked the voice-assistant the live score of a recent game, according to a person in the room, and was openly frustrated that Alexa didn’t know an answer that was so easy to find online. 

When reached for comment, Amazon pointed to the company’s annual shareholder letter released last month. In it, Jassy mentioned that the company was building a “substantial number of GenAI applications across every Amazon consumer business,” adding that that included “an even more intelligent and capable Alexa.”

The team is now tasked with turning Alexa into a relevant device that holds up amid the new AI competition, and one that justifies the resources and headcount Amazon has dedicated to it. It has undergone a massive reorganization, with much of the team shifting to the artificial general intelligence, or AGI, team, according to three sources. Others pointed to bloat within Alexa, a team of thousands of employees.

As of 2023, Amazon said it had sold more than 500 million Alexa-enabled devices, giving the company a foothold with consumers. 

Alexa, were you too early?

Apple, Amazon and Google were early movers with their voice assistants, which did employ AI. But the current wave of advanced generative AI enables much more creative, human-sounding interactions. Apple is expected to unveil a more conversational Siri at its annual developers conference in June, according to the New York Times. 

Those who worked on the Alexa team describe it as a great idea that may have been too early, and that it’s going to be hard to turn the ship around. 

There’s also the challenge of finding AI engineering talent, as OpenAI, Microsoft and Google recruit from the same pool of academics and tech talent. Plus, generative AI workloads are expensive thanks to the hardware and computing power required. One source estimated the cost of using generative AI in Alexa at 2 cents per query, and said a $20 price point was floated internally. Another suggested it would need to be in a single digit dollar amount, which would undercut other subscription offerings. OpenAI’s ChatGPT charges $20 per month for its advanced models. 

Still, they point to Alexa’s installed user base, with devices in hundreds of millions of homes, as an opportunity. Those who worked on Alexa say the fact that it’s already in people’s living rooms and kitchens makes the stakes higher, and mistakes more costly if Alexa doesn’t understand a command or provides unreliable information. 

Amazon has been battling a perception that it’s behind in artificial intelligence. While it offers multiple AI models on AWS, it does not have a leading large language model to unseat OpenAI, Google or Meta. Amazon spent $2.75 billion backing AI startup Anthropic, its largest venture investment in the company’s three-decade history. Google also has an Anthropic investment and partnership.

Amazon will use its own large language model, Titan, in the Alexa upgrade, according to a source.  

Bezos is among those who have voiced concern that Amazon is behind in AI, according to two sources familiar with him. Bezos is still “very involved” in Amazon’s AI efforts, CNBC reported last week, and has been sending Amazon executives emails wondering why certain AI startups are picking other cloud providers over AWS.

2024-05-16 11:06:06,Meta,META,Meta slapped with child safety probe under sweeping EU tech law ,"Facebook parent company Meta on Thursday was hit with a major investigation from the European Union into alleged breaches of the bloc’s strict online content law over child safety risks.

The European Commission, the EU’s executive body, said in a statement that it is investigating whether the social media giant’s Facebook and Instagram platforms “may stimulate behavioural addictions in children, as well as create so-called ‘rabbit-hole effects’.”

The Commission added that it is concerned about age verifications on Meta’s platforms, as well as privacy risks linked to the company’s recommendation algorithms.

“We want young people to have safe, age-appropriate experiences online and have spent a decade developing more than 50 tools and policies designed to protect them,” a Meta spokesperson told CNBC by email.

“This is a challenge the whole industry is facing, and we look forward to sharing details of our work with the European Commission.”

The Commission said that its decision to initiate an investigation comes of the back of a preliminary analysis of risk assessment report provided by Meta in September 2023.

Thierry Breton, the EU’s commissioner for internal market, said in a statement that the regulator is “not convinced [that Meta] has done enough to comply with the DSA obligations to mitigate the risks of negative effects to the physical and mental health of young Europeans on its platforms.”

The EU said it will carry out an in-depth investigation into Meta’s child protection measures “as a matter of priority.” The bloc can continue to gather evidence via requests for information, interviews, or inspections.

The initiation of a DSA probe allows the EU to take further enforcement steps, including interim measures and non-compliance decisions, the Commission said. The Commission added it can also consider commitments made by Meta to remedy its concerns.

Meta and fellow U.S. tech giants have been increasingly finding themselves in the spotlight of EU scrutiny since the introduction of the bloc’s landmark Digital Services Act, a ground-breaking law from the European Commission seeking to tackle harmful content.

Under the EU’s DSA, companies can be fined up to 6% of their global annual revenues for violations. The bloc is yet to issue fines to any tech giants under its new law.

In December 2023, the EU opened infringement proceedings into X, the company previously known as Twitter, over suspected failure to combat content disinformation and manipulation.

The Commission is also investigating Meta over alleged infringements of the DSA related to its handling of election disinformation.

In April, the bloc launched a probe into the firm and said it’s concerned Meta hasn’t done enough to combat disinformation ahead of upcoming European Parliament elections.

The EU is not the only authority taking action against Meta over child safety concerns.

In the U.S., the attorney general of New Mexico is suing the firm over allegations that Facebook and Instagram enabled child sexual abuse, solicitation, and trafficking.

A Meta spokesperson at the time said that the company deploys “sophisticated technology” and takes other preventive steps to root out predators.

2024-05-15 19:18:59,Meta,META,Dell surges 9% on optimism it has secured big AI server orders ,"Dell shares rose more than 9% on Wednesday to an all-time high after Morgan Stanley raised its price target and predicted that the company would rake in sales from the insatiable demand for artificial intelligence servers.

Dell is seeing accelerating momentum, especially in winning business to build AI servers, unlocking a new bull case for the stock, Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring wrote in a note on Wednesday. He upgraded his price target on Dell from $128 per share to $152 a share and called it a top pick.

“All-in, we are hearing about more AI server momentum at Dell than at any other OEM,” Woodring wrote, saying that he expected about $10 billion of AI server revenue in the company’s fiscal 2025 — ending next February.

Wednesday’s move was the largest since March 1, when the stock surged after earnings showed that the computer manufacturer has benefited from the AI boom.

Dell shares are now up over 95% in 2024, trailing the 220% gain from rival AI servermaker Super Micro Computer but surpassing Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s 5% gains this year.

Most AI servers are built around Nvidia’s chips, which have become prized in the technology industry because they are used to deploy advanced AI models from companies like Google, OpenAI and Meta. Dell sells servers using the newest Nvidia AI chips, including its H100 GPU and the latest Blackwell-generation chips.

At Nvidia’s annual conference in March, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang appeared to send customers who want the latest AI chips to Dell for orders.

“You’re going to need an AI factory,” Huang said. “And nobody is better at building end-to-end systems of very large scale for the enterprise than Dell.”

“Michael [Dell] is here and he’s happy to take your order,” Huang continued.

“While the near-exponential ramp of Nvidia GPU shipments and AI servers builds make it difficult to pin down exact growth rates,” Woodring wrote, he has confidence in Dell’s business for various reasons. Among those reasons are the strengthening demand for AI servers and that he models Dell’s market share increasing.

He wrote that Dell may be able to upsell its customers and “attach” additional hardware, such as data storage.

Dell is expected to announce its April quarter earnings on May 30. Nvidia reports earnings for its quarter ending in April on May 22.

Dell’s other business, building PCs for consumers and businesses running Microsoft Windows, could get a boost next week when Microsoft reveals new capabilities at its conference, including long-awaited AI features that many analysts expect to drive demand for new PCs.

PC sales have slumped for two years in a post-pandemic hangover, as consumers and enterprises who bought new machines during 2020 and 2021 pushed back the timeline for their next upgrades.

But the PC industry is on course to grow again and is outperforming lowered expectations, Woodring wrote, which will benefit Dell.

“We remain bullish on the PC market recovery as we are not only hearing about upgrade/refresh demand in our recent CIO and VAR checks, but also seeing upward revisions to notebook ODM builds in recent months,” Woodring wrote.

2024-05-07 21:01:58,Meta,META,Reddit shares soar 14% after company reports revenue pop in first earnings report,"Reddit shares rallied 14% in extended trading on Tuesday after the company released quarterly results for the first time since its IPO in March.

Here’s how the company did:

Loss per share: $8.19 loss per share. That may not compare with the $8.71 loss expected by LSEG

Revenue: $243 million vs. $212.8 million expected by LSEG

Revenue climbed 48% from $163.7 million a year earlier. The company reported $222.7 million in ad revenue for the period, up 39% year over year, which is a faster rate of growth than at its top competitors.

Digital advertising companies have started growing again at a healthy clip after brands reeled in spending to cope with inflation in 2022. Meta’s ad revenue jumped 27% in the first quarter, followed by 24% growth at Amazon and 13% growth at Google parent Alphabet.

Reddit reported a net loss of $575.1 million. Stock-based compensation expenses and related taxes were $595.5 million, primarily driven by IPO charges.

For the second quarter, Reddit expects revenue of $240 million to $255 million, topping the $224 million expected by analysts, according to LSEG. The midpoint of the guidance range suggests growth of about 32% for the second quarter, up from $183 million from a year earlier.

Reddit, which hosts millions of online forums on its platform, was founded in 2005 by Alexis Ohanian and Steve Huffman, the company’s CEO. 

“We see this as the beginning of a new chapter as we work towards building the next generation of Reddit,” Huffman said in a release Tuesday.

Reddit began trading under the ticker symbol “RDDT” on the New York Stock Exchange in March. The company priced its IPO at $34 per share, which valued the company around $6.5 billion. When tech valuations were red hot in 2021, Reddit’s private market valuation reached $10 billion.

The stock climbed past $58 in after-hours trading on Tuesday before coming back a bit. Should the stock close above $57.75 on Wednesday, it would be at its highest since March 26, its fourth day of trading. The shares closed that day at $65.11, their highest yet.

The company reported 82.7 million daily active users for its first quarter, up from the 76.6 million expected by StreetAccount. Average revenue per user worldwide rose 8% to $2.94 from $2.72 a year ago.

2024-05-07 15:54:29,Meta,META,Is the big AI hardware spend behind us?,"Im curious if the massive AI spend on hardware is coming to an end and the new spend will be AI software and development.

-Stanley Druckenmiller cut his NVDA stake

-Brad Gerstner a top advocate for AI today on cnbc mention his fund has a few short positions and trimmed some stakes in AI holdings.

-NVDA insiders have been consistently selling over the last year. All insiders at AI companies have been for that matter.

-SMCI didn't pre release earnings as they did before.

-NVDA delivery delays are shrinking.

-MCHP earnings were in line, didnt blow past expectations.

-INTC bombed on earnings

-AMD didnt blow past expectations

-ARM releases earnings this week, will see what their order flow looks like.

-ASML orders took a dive.

-Buffet sold some Apple, doenst seem to be phased by their AI initiatives.

-Even Meta mentioned their new goal is AI metaverse software development. Seems they got all the chips they need. They also lowered guidance going forward.

-These earnings are crucial for NVDA, this could determine the next steps for the AI cycle.

-Theres also growing competition in chip developments, seems every company(Apple, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Oracle, etc) are making their own chips for custom use.

I just dont think there is an issue getting chip anymore. The issue is creating the software for actual use of AI and generating cash flow. The 1 year honeymoon period may be over, AI spending needs to start adding to earnings. otherwise its a massive expense for alot of companies of buying the chips and spending a lot of money on electricity to run the machines.

>A landmark antitrust case pitting Google (GOOG, GOOGL) against the Justice Department entered its final stage this past week as prosecutors from the federal government and 14 states said in their closing arguments that Google illegally monopolized the online search and search advertising markets.

>A government win would certainly threaten a giant piece of Google’s $237.8 billion profit engine. But the outcome, which will be decided by US District Judge Amit Mehta in the weeks or months to come, also has giant implications for some of the other big names in the tech world.

>That's because Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) are defending themselves against a series of other federal- and state-led antitrust suits, some of which make similar claims, and because all three stand to lose or gain depending on the outcome.

>The government argues Google is violating Section 2 of the Sherman Act by blocking competitors from entering three distinct markets: general online search, search advertising, and search text advertising.

>A government win would put at risk the billions of dollars in mutually lucrative contracts between Google and Apple, as well as deals with other device manufacturers and telecom companies.

> The government alleged in its case that Google pays billions of dollars each year to LG, Motorola (MSI), and Samsung; major US wireless carriers such as AT&T (T), T-Mobile (TMUS), and Verizon (VZ); and browser developers such as Mozilla, Opera, and UCWeb.

>Government prosecutors have alleged that Google had been paying Apple an estimated $8 billion to $12 billion per year — a portion of search ad revenue — in exchange for awarding Google Search default placement on Apple devices.

>The government has yet to say what precise remedy it desires should it prevail against Google. If the government does win on any of its claims, a separate remedies phase of the trial would be held.",469,173,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ckv9wx/the_ending_of_googles_monopoly_trial_has_silicon/

As of recently, Google and Meta decide to begin giving out dividends to its shareholders. Is this seen as bullish? 

We hold big tech firms due to huge earning growth potential and they tend to distribute their earnings into innovation and R&D, which will with no doubt boost their future earning if done right. 

Now that Google and Meta begin to give out dividend, it seems appealing for mutual fund managers to add more into their portfolios, which will boost their stock prices further. But this will probably hurt their future earning potential in long term as they will have less allocated to R&D. What do y'all think?

In its investor letter, Snap said its revenue growth was primarily driven by improvements in the company’s advertising platform, as well as demand for its direct-response advertising solutions. 

Advertising revenue came in at $1.11 billion in the first quarter. Snap’s “Other Revenue” category, which is primarily driven by Snapchat+ subscribers, reached $87 million, an increase of 194% year over year. Snap reported more than 9 million Snapchat+ subscribers for the period.

Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $46 million, far surpassing the $68 million loss expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount. In its investor letter, Snap said adjusted EBITDA “exceeded our expectations” and was primarily driven by operating expense discipline, as well as accelerating revenue growth.

“Given the progress we have made with our ad platform, the leadership team we have built, and the strategic priorities we have set, we believe we are well positioned to continue to improve our business performance,” Snap wrote in the letter. 

Though Snap’s growth accelerated, it still fell behind that of Meta, which reported 27% growth in its better-than-expected first-quarter results on Wednesday. Meta shares plunged anyway after the company issued a light forecast and spooked investors with talk of its long-term investments.

Snap’s net loss for the quarter narrowed to $305.1 million, or a 19 cent loss per share, from $328.7 million, or a 21 cent loss per share, the year prior. 

For its second quarter, Snap expects to report revenue between $1.23 billion and $1.26 billion, up from the $1.22 billion expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount. Snap said adjusted EBITDA will fall between $15 million and $45 million, compared to Wall Street’s expectations of $15.5 million. 

Snap reported 422 million daily active users (DAUs) in the first quarter, up 10% year over year. The company expects to report around 431 million DAUs in its second quarter, up from the 430 million expected by StreetAccount. 

The company also provided a forecast for its full-year 2024 cost structure. Snap said quarterly infrastructure costs per DAU will fall between 83 cents and 85 cents for the rest of the year.

“We will continue to assess our infrastructure investment levels based on what is in the best long-term interest of our business,” Snap said. 

Snap said the amount of time users spent watching content grew year over year, primarily due to engagement with Spotlight and Creator Stories. The company said time spent watching Spotlight, which aggregates content from users, increased 125% year over year.

In February, Snap announced it would lay off 10% of its global workforce, or around 500 employees. The company said Thursday that headcount and personnel costs will “grow modestly” through the rest of the year.

2024-04-25 03:18:51,Meta,META,Meta's Reality Labs posts $3.85 billion loss in first quarter,"Meta shows no signs of substantially trimming its losses from investing in the metaverse, as competition heightens between the Facebook parent and Apple in the virtual reality market.

In its first-quarter earnings report Wednesday, Meta disclosed that its Reality Labs unit recorded a $3.85 billion operating loss. Revenue in the metaverse division was $440 million, up about 30% from $339 million a year ago and representing only around 1% of Meta’s total sales for the quarter.

Analysts were expecting a $4.31 billion operating loss and sales of $512.5 million for the quarter, according to StreetAccount.

Reality Labs has now lost more than $45 billion since the end of 2020, when Meta first began reporting the business segment separately.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called the metaverse “the next frontier,” imagining a digital world that facilitates both productivity and recreation. He changed the name of his company from Facebook to Meta in 2021 to reflect his vision for the future of computing.

For now, developing metaverse technology remains a fledgling and costly effort.

The company unveiled in September the Quest 3 VR headset, the latest version of its mixed reality hardware, with a starting price of $499. Apple started selling its $3,499 Vision Pro in February, touting a so-called “spatial computing” experience.

Meta announced Monday that it will partner with third-party hardware companies to create new VR headsets using the same Meta Horizon operating system that powers its Quest headsets. Zuckerberg said that while Apple “basically won out” in the phone market with its closed ecosystem, Meta’s move aims to ensure the “open model defines the next generation of computing.”

2024-04-24 20:10:58,Meta,META,Meta reports revenue and earnings beat but issues disappointing guidance; down 11%,"Meta shares plunged in extended trading on Wednesday after the company issued a light forecast, overshadowing better-than-expected first-quarter results.

Here are the key numbers:

Earnings per share: $4.71 per share vs. $4.32 per share expected by LSEG

Revenue: $36.46 billion vs. $36.16 billion expected by LSEG

Revenue increased 27% from $28.65 billion in the same period a year earlier, the fastest rate of expansion for any quarter since 2021.

Meta said it expects revenue in the second quarter of $36.5 billion to $39 billion. The midpoint of the range, $37.75 billion, would represent 18% year-over-year growth and is below analysts’ average estimate of $38.3 billion.

2024-04-22 17:38:34,Meta,META,"Meta opens Quest OS to third-party headset makers, taps Lenovo and Xbox as partners","The mixed reality operating system that powers Meta Quest headsets can officially be used by third-party device makers, the company announced on Monday. Now called “Meta Horizon OS,” the open system allows developers to access technologies like eye, face, hand, and body tracking, high-resolution passthrough, and more.

Three major tech players—Asus, Lenovo and Microsoft’s Xbox—are the first companies to confirm they’ll be developing new devices that run the software. Most notably, Microsoft is teaming up with Meta to build a “limited-edition Meta Quest, inspired by Xbox,” according to the announcement. Asus and Lenovo, on the other hand, are building headsets designed for specific use cases. Asus is developing a headset dedicated to gaming whereas Lenovo wants its device to be for “productivity, learning, and entertainment.”

The company says all future headsets can connect via the same Meta Quest app on iOS and Android. Plus, the Meta Quest Store, which the company renamed the Meta Horizon Store, is open to third-party developers, allowing them to use Meta’s frameworks and tools to create new mixed-reality experiences.

Meta Horizon OS is a strategic move for the company and comes at a time when the VR/AR headset wars between Meta, Apple and Sony continue to heat up.

2024-04-18 20:51:57,Meta,META,"Meta’s new AI assistant is rolling out across WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Messenger","Meta
 on Thursday announced its free artificial intelligence assistant, Meta AI, is rolling out across its social media platforms WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Messenger.

The assistant can answer questions, create animations and generate images, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a video. Meta AI was built on the company’s latest large language model called Meta Llama 3, which was also announced Thursday.

The AI tool is Meta’s competitor to OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google
 Gemini but, in a unique twist, Meta has also partnered with Google and Microsoft
 to provide results from both companies’ search engines.

“We believe that Meta AI is now the most intelligent AI assistant that you can freely use,” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in the video.

Shares of Meta closed up more than 1% Thursday.

Meta AI is built into the search box of the WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Messenger apps so users can easily ask questions that can be answered through the new tool.

For instance, the company said users can ask Meta AI for restaurant recommendations, help planning a vacation or inspiration to decorate a new apartment.

Meta AI is also available on the website “meta.ai,” where users can ask the assistant for help with tasks like solving a math problem or writing a professional email, according to the release. Users can log their conversations for future reference.

Meta said the assistant’s image-generation feature will be available in beta on WhatsApp and the MetaAI website. Users will see an image appear as they start typing and MetaAI will provide prompts to help change or refine the image. The images can also be animated into a GIF that users can share.

Meta first introduced Meta AI in beta at its Connect event in September. The assistant is rolling out in English across more than a dozen countries including the U.S., Canada, New Zealand and Australia, starting Thursday.

2024-04-11 00:39:22,Meta,META,My bearish thesis on $META,"The stock is ripe for pull back. Somehow META has managed to stay off the radar in this rally.  
Litigation- The FTC wants to tighten an existing 2020 Facebook privacy settlement to ban profiting from minors' data and expand curbs on facial recognition technology. The agency has accused Meta of misleading parents about protections for children. The FTC also wants undo the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, claiming Meta illegally maintains a monopoly in “personal social networking”. If these go through it will be a massive blow to the bottom line. Twitter is also suing Meta claiming Threads copied their business and trade secret theft, we'll see how this plays out. Lets also mention the never ending regulatory fines and litigation with European agencies. All these issues are a serious liability for the company.  
The competition- The single biggest threat to Meta is TikTok. The reason they are lobbying so hard to get it banned. People migrate to the next big thing, older generations dont like change so i fully expect them to stay with Facebook until the end but the smart money saw whats happening with TikTok, how fast its taken over the younger generation and they want it, all of it. Steven Mnuchin is a smart man, he knows at the current rate of TikToks growth its going to overtake Facebook and Instagram within the next 2-3 years. Its in a hyper growth stage and Meta has simply stalled out.  
https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/14/former-treasury-secretary-mnuchin-is-putting-together-an-investor-group-to-buy-tiktok.html  
TikTok is also launching a direct competitor to Instagram and WhatsApp, very soon. Those users 35 and under currently on Insta will easily migrate over to the newest thing. There is no loyalty to a service or app. If you are spending most of your time already watching tiktok, you can easily switch over to Notes, no need to go back to Instagram if all your friend are posting videos,pictures and chatting on TikTok. More time spent on Tiktok, less time on Meta apps.  
https://www.forbes.com/sites/maryroeloffs/2024/04/09/tiktok-is-testing-a-new-instagram-rival-are-photos-making-a-comeback/  
The presidential election- The Presidential ad spending is always massive and grows each year but its very limited. Only 28.1 percent goes to digital marketing, most goes toward tv ads not small facebook, google and newspaper ads.  
AI - Meta announced their AI plans even making their own chips, or designing their own chips. This seems like a last ditch effort to stay relevant and a costly venture like the metaverse. I don't see what meta could do with AI other than mine peoples data more efficiently and sell it. Picture and video AI is limited, there's so many third party apps that can do it better.  
Meta is running out of ideas, the company has peaked, we may start to see declining revenue and user activity year after year. The balance of influence is shifting. Meta had its run, time to join Myspace.  
lastly the dividend, another effort to keep investors around. You can get a higher yield and take less risk holding a treasury bond.
