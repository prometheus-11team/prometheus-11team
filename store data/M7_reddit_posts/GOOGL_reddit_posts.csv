2025-04-29 04:07:40,Alphabet,GOOGL,What should I be looking at in the upcoming META earning call?,"For Meta Platforms (META), the upcoming earnings call (scheduled for April 30, after market close) is highly anticipated, especially with big tech volatility and renewed focus on AI, advertising, and cost control. Here are the most important things to watch and key questions the market will focus on:

# 1. Advertising Revenue & AI Initiatives

* **Core Focus:** Analysts expect AI-driven improvements in ad targeting and engagement to drive modest revenue and EPS beats, with estimates at $41.36 billion in revenue and $5.21 EPS.
* **Watch for:**
   * Specific numbers and commentary on AI’s impact on ad efficiency and pricing.
   * Competitive positioning versus other social platforms and Google.
   * How AI tools are translating into measurable monetization gains.

# 2. Cost Controls & Margins

* **Key Metrics:** Operating margin, net margin, and cash flow are in focus as META’s cost discipline has been a major driver of stock gains recently.
* **Watch for:**
   * Updated cost guidance, especially R&D and infrastructure spend for AI.
   * Is cost discipline sustainable, or is spending ramping up again (especially for Reality Labs and AI infrastructure)?

# 3. Reality Labs / Metaverse Segment

* **Trends Analysis:** There’s been a major spike in public interest in Reality Labs in the last few months, likely tied to new product launches or AI innovations.
* **Watch for:**
   * Progress on AR/VR devices, user engagement metrics, and revenue/cost breakdowns.
   * Management’s view on the timeline for profitability in Reality Labs.

# 4. Regulatory Risks & Shareholder Proposals

* **News Focus:** Ongoing regulatory scrutiny (antitrust, privacy, content) and a notable shareholder proposal addressing online antisemitism and hate speech risks.
* **Watch for:**
   * Management’s commentary on legal and regulatory headwinds.
   * Updates on how META is addressing shareholder concerns regarding platform safety and governance.

# 5. AI Spending & Geopolitical Headwinds

* **News Focus:** Investor concerns about Meta’s AI capex amid tariff and trade policy uncertainty (especially with recent political headlines).
* **Watch for:**
   * Any adjustments to AI/data center spending plans.
   * Management’s assessment of tariff/trade impacts on supply chain and costs.

# 6. Valuation & Guidance

* **Current Valuation:** META’s trailing P/E is \~22.3, with strong growth (EPS up 62% YoY, revenue up 22% YoY) but recent stock price pullback (down \~28% from peak).
* **Watch for:**
   * Updated guidance for Q2 and full-year—are growth and margin targets intact?
   * Commentary on buybacks or potential capital returns (dividends, repurchases).

# What Analysts & the Market Want to Hear

* Evidence that AI is not just a buzzword but is materially driving revenue and efficiency.
* Confidence that META can navigate regulatory and cost challenges without derailing growth.
* A roadmap for profitability or meaningful traction from Reality Labs.
* Clarity on spending discipline and capital allocation priorities.

# Trends & Sentiment

* Public and market interest in Reality Labs is surging, while the core Family of Apps sees steady but less dramatic attention—pointing to high expectations for innovation and new product cycles.
* Sentiment remains cautiously optimistic but sensitive to any negative surprises, especially on costs or regulatory issues.

**Action Item:** Listen for specifics on AI monetization, cost outlook, regulatory strategy, and Reality Labs progress. Management’s tone and detail on these fronts will likely drive META’s post-earnings price action.",0,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kaf5pp/what_should_i_be_looking_at_in_the_upcoming_meta/

It's been a marathon already, and this week feels especially significant. The administration's next moves will reveal how seriously they plan to tackle policies that could shape the economy for the rest of the term.

Mr T loves big announcements on Milestones dates.

Market tension is high—ready to either crash or launch into orbit, or both, or nothing. Exciting times...

Airlines and hospitality stocks, often recession barometers, are hovering near 52-week lows.

Defensive sectors like Utilities and Real Estate—known for steady cash flow—have held up relatively well, for now.

Gold and precious metals have performed solidly... but does gold still matter? What’s really in Fort Knox? Is Bitcoin becoming the new gold, especially given the administration’s ties to crypto?

Consumer cyclicals: struggling.

Financials: murky—what’s the real state of loan delinquencies?

Tech: unclear. The “Magnificent Seven” promised a boom. Nvidia remains lean and efficient, Fatty 70\~75% contribution margin, but possibly at the cost of long-term strategic dominance.

Healthcare: everyone’s stressed—literally and figuratively.

Industrials: tangled in supply chain headaches.

Energy: ""drill baby drill"" isn’t moving the needle enough.

Communication: ad volume is high, engagement unclear.

Tesla: big meme energy! with over 80% of revenue still tied to automotive, is facing persistent sales decline. Signs point to a deliberate pivot—with Musk strengthening ties with government for a transformative strategy that will merge most of his ventures under a keiretsu; for a defense-data-space-industrial hybrid business model relying on perpetual long-term public/governments contracts. Citizen taxes revenue for life! with or without Palantir? to what extent a damaged brand is curable?

Google: what is the highest and best use of my data portfolio? hey, Palantir! let’s partner with federal agencies and supercharge AI

Our investment portfolio: for some, molested; for other, Bonanza!

Traditional foreign allies : confused

Canada: flabbergasted, throwing poutines at the wall

Montreal: can you confidently deal with us for a week if we all become part of US?

France : confused and also happy, what an opportunity !selling the idea of nuclear umbrella to Europe, resuscitating Rafale?

Italy : the pope ..I am tired, Arrivederci

China: Go figure out!

Japan: Holding the treasury bill for now

Brazil: Corcovaaadoo! joga boniiito, are you still organizing the world cup?

Tariffs: cant we all get alonnnggg?

My Cat: indifferent

2025-04-27 15:52:41,Alphabet,GOOGL,Big Tech’s Earnings Problem Is Estimates May Be Way Too High,">The last time Big Tech delivered earnings, Donald Trump had just started his term, stocks were soaring on expectations of a pro-growth government agenda and investors’ main worry was how long it would take companies to convert their artificial intelligence spending into profits.

>Three months later, they are facing a far bleaker picture.

>This week’s quarterly results from Microsoft Corp., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc will land in a market obsessed with every twist of a trade war that’s wiped $5.5 trillion from the S&P 500 Index. AI concerns have taken a back seat to angst over the possibility of a tariff-induced recession, while safe havens like gold have become the trade de jour for investors too rattled to buy stocks on the cheap.

>Even with all the uncertainty, Wall Street isn’t giving the companies’ estimates much wiggle room. Analysts expect the so-called Magnificent Seven — which also includes Google-parent Alphabet, Tesla Inc. and Nvidia Corp. — to deliver an average of 15% profit growth in 2025, a forecast that’s barely budged since the start of March despite the flareup in trade tensions.

>That raises the stakes for the four megacaps reporting this week, which collectively have a nearly 20% weighting in the S&P 500. Traders are unlikely to forgive earnings shortfalls in an already fearful market climate, despite steep declines in the stocks’ share prices and improved valuations. Dire outlooks from the industry behemoths would also be poorly received, especially if they bolster fears of muted corporate spending ahead.

>“Any modicum of a weaker than expected number is going to cause a further selloff because of the concern around tariffs,” said Phil Blancato, chief market strategist at Osaic Wealth, who believes this year’s weakness in megacaps is a buying opportunity.

>Markets got an early read on how Big Tech might be faring last week. Tesla reported its worst quarter in years, though traders cheered signs that chief executive Elon Musk intends to step away from his government work and focus more on the electric-vehicle maker. Alphabet beat expectations but offered little future guidance. The Bloomberg Magnificent 7 index jumped 9.1% last week amid a broader market rebound, though it’s still down 15% in 2025.

>A deeper look comes during a two-day stretch that starts with results from Meta and Microsoft on Wednesday. While many executives have declined to predict how tariffs might impact their bottom lines, Wall Street has been doing its own math. Based on a 22% tariff rate modeled by Bloomberg Economics, lower gross margins could result in a net income contraction of about 7% in 2025 for the S&P 500, compared with the current consensus estimate of nearly 12% growth, wrote Bloomberg Intelligence chief equity strategist Gina Martin Adams.

>Another key area of focus will be spending: The four biggest spenders — Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta — are projected to pour roughly $300 billion into capital expenditures in their current fiscal years. While the companies have pledged to maintain that pace in 2025, Microsoft’s sudden decision to pause work on some data centers suggests cloud computing providers may be re-evaluating expenditures.

>Apple, one of the companies most exposed to tariffs due to its supply chain reliance on China, may benefit from a pull-forward in demand from consumers seeking to avoid higher prices. However, those sales are seen as a one-off benefit, with tariffs sapping demand in future quarters. Amazon faces tariff risks to its e-commerce and advertising businesses, though a hit to profits could be cushioned by earnings in its high-margin web services unit, according to Jefferies analyst Brent Thill.

>That said, there’s little expectation that executives will be able to give estimates with any degree of confidence, given the high level of macroeconomic uncertainty. American Airlines Group Inc. and Skechers USA Inc. are among companies that have abandoned forecasts this quarter.

>Michael Shaoul, founder of the ION Macro Fund, said it will be difficult for executives to convince the market that they have a true view into financial performance in coming quarters.

>“I think the more experienced management aren’t even going to try,” he said.

>A bullish argument, of course, is that tech giants’ dominant industry positions and robust balance sheets make them better suited to withstand an economic downturn than other companies — even if the earnings picture is cloudy. The Magnificent Seven are also less richly valued following the recent selloff: Alphabet, for example, trades at 17 times profits estimated over the next 12 months, compared with an average over the past decade of 21 times, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

>That could boost the appeal of the Magnificent Seven to dip-buyers, especially if signs of easing in the global trade war emerge. A flash of that came last week, when stocks soared after Trump said a deal with Beijing would significantly reduce the tariffs he’s posted on Chinese goods.

>But for Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer and chief market strategist at Truist Advisory Services, it all comes down to the denominator in the price-to-earnings ratio.

>“The valuations are getting more interesting down here, but we haven’t pulled the trigger yet,” he said. “There are a lot of questions on the E-side of the equation.”

2025-04-26 04:46:11,Alphabet,GOOGL,Google stock is cheap because investors have misunderstood Google Search’s business model,"No, Google is not aiming to be the Search Engine for Everything and Anything. That role is slowly getting replaced by AI. Google is trying to be the search engine for everything to do with shopping. Basically, if you want to book a hotel, buy a car, find rental places, you go to Google. If you want to know how big bang started, Google doesn’t give a fuck. If you want to know if that restaurant is good, Google shows you a bunch of reviews. Google Search is a shopping search engine. 

Don’t believe me? Try ordinary searches like when did Julius Caesar conquered Gaul or how birds make chirping noises. You will notice zero ads. Now try searching anything with commercial intent, boom, ads, and that’s what advertisers want. Google ads are also somewhat useful to consumers who are looking for certain products. 

In other words, ChatGPT can replace Google Search in terms of Wikipedia knowledge or complex subjects like learning physics. But ChatGPT is not going to replace Google Search’s role as the world’s shopping discovery platform. Basically anything you want to buy, or any product you want to research on, you go to Google. This is why Google Search is still so profitable and why Bing Search who doesn’t have all these data can never compete against it. Do you think people are searching knowledge stuff like Reddit geeks? Nope, people are searching for things to buy. 

For those who claim Google Search is dying because you can’t find answers to your physics or coding questions, you have completely misunderstood Google Search’s role in this world. Google has transitioned to this role a long long time ago and they know adding more commercial ads will make Google Search’s knowledge based searches less useful. 

Moreover, Google is also adding AI Overview which makes people who want to search non commercial topics have a much easier time finding what they want. (AI overview is pushed to 1.5 billion users, and Google’s advertising revenue has not seen a dent. This is proof knowledge based searches don’t make Google money.)

Google will be adding AI search where you can actually talk to it in Google Search soon. That will certainly keep the knowledge crowd to continue using Google. So even if Google doesn’t care about non commercial searches, it is still doing a lot to maintain its share in knowledge based searches. 

TLDR: Google is not a knowledge search engine. It is a shopping search engine and it excels at being one. People use Google as a shopping search engine much more than getting knowledge from it. ",1114,318,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1k84w88/google_stock_is_cheap_because_investors_have/

2025-04-25 18:35:21,Alphabet,GOOGL,Nearly 25% of Google’s Q1 net income reportedly came from its SpaceX investment,"Last night and into this morning, Alphabet investors have been cheering yesterday’s big earnings beat, with the tech giant posting revenue and earnings-per-share figures that surpassed Wall Street expectations for the first quarter of the year. 

While there were a handful of big numbers in the Google parent company’s earnings for shareholders to get stoked about — like Google Cloud revenue jumping 28% year over year to hit $12.3 billion, or YouTube ad revenue climbing 10% in the same period — one figure fell a little by the wayside in the excitement. From the report: 
“Net Gain on Equity Securities

OI&E of $11.2 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2025 included an $8.0 billion unrealized gain on our non-marketable equity securities related to our investment in a private company.”

The mysterious, unnamed private company that added an extra $8 billion to the search behemoth’s bottom line in Q1? Elon Musk’s SpaceX, per Bloomberg reporting.

In December, the valuation of Musk’s private rocket company had reportedly soared by almost $100 billion in just one month, reaching $350 billion after its latest round of employee share purchases. That was good news for Musk, certainly, whose stake in SpaceX outweighed his Tesla shares on paper in February, but also for other big investors in the 23-year-old business, not least Google.

In early 2015 — months before cofounder Larry Page had even announced the formation of Alphabet as Google’s parent company — Google made a joint $1 billion investment in SpaceX alongside Fidelity, giving the two a combined ~10% stake in Musk’s company, which was “exploring new ways to connect people to the internet” at the time. Those ambitions would be realized down the line with Starlink’s growing fleet, while Google’s 2015 investment in the rocket business is clearly still paying off a decade later.

>Alphabet’s executives said that although it’s too early to tell the exact impact macro conditions will have, the company expects some headwinds to its ads business, particularly from Asia.

>Investors peppered Alphabet executives with questions about “macro” conditions amid new trade policies during the company’s first-quarter earnings call.

>Executives said the company is still on track to spend $75 billion in capital though individual quarter’s timelines may be impacted.

Looks like this could potentially be the reason for the muted reaction on GOOGL stock despite the large earnings beat. Any thoughts on why else GOOGL is only up 1% and trending downwards after a good earnings report?

2025-04-25 16:10:59,Alphabet,GOOGL,Google needs to change,"Google traded flat after a fantastic earnings report, while Tesla surged more than 20% following a disastrous one. It sounds nonsensical, but clearly, you don’t need to make money to boost your stock price.

Google’s main problem is its inability to brag about what it has. The company doesn’t know how to sell a dream or hype up investors. If Elon were Google’s CEO, Waymo would already rival Tesla’s FSD, Google’s TPUs would be marketed as superior to Nvidia’s GPUs, and its pharma investments would be framed as more valuable than all major pharmaceutical companies combined. Once Google learns to envision and promote some sci-fi-level narratives, this company could easily surpass a $5 trillion valuation.

Not to mention with the recent market uncertainty, some great buying opportunities have opened up in these stocks. Besides Tesla which in my view is still overvalued as hell.

I’ll start - I own Amazon, Meta and Google because I feel like I’m able to determine their intrinsic value appropriately.

Skip on Apple because I’m concerned about a lack of innovation and slowing earnings growth.

Skip on NVIDIA because I don’t understand the product enough to determine whether or not it has long term value creation.

Skip on Tesla for aforementioned reasons.

Skip on Microsoft due to stagnation in earnings.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2025-04-24 16:38:54,Alphabet,GOOGL,Tesla Earnings: The Old Used Kleenex Trick Works Again,"Well... Tesla bulls cheered after one of the worst earnings reports in company history (maybe even *the* worst). Here is the high level takeaway from Barron's:

""*Tesla stock is surging, but make no mistake: The quarter wasn’t good. The stock reaction is more of a lesson in expectations and the stock market rather than a financial one.*

*Sales, operating profit, and net income fell 9%, 66%, and 39% year over year. That belies how weak the EV business is currently. From peak quarterly levels, Tesla’s sales are 25% lower and net income is 77% lower. First-quarter operating profit is down 90% from a fourth-quarter 2022 peak of $3.9 billion.*"" 

(Source: [Tesla: Just How Bad Was This Quarter?](https://www.barrons.com/livecoverage/tesla-earnings-stock-price-musk/card/just-how-bad-was-this-quarter))

I keep using my facetious tech-jargony term: ERDF (Elon Reality Distortion Field) to explain how Elon can overcome even the worst news with hype. But it is a real thing! And it really works.

Here is the bottom line if you are a Tesla bull: Elon can tell the markets to ignore all of 2025, plummeting sales, self-created political drama and chaos, complete lack of focus in his leadership at the company, brand damage, endless delays, failed product launches (e.g., Cybertruck), rising competition, need to replace 4M computers in their cars to get anything resembling FSD so they don't get sued (again), and losing 90% of the company's operating profit and turn it into a juicy buying opportunity. 

The ticker doesn't lie. The stock goes up as the profit goes down (dramatically), driving the P/E ratio even further away from reality, now approaching jaw-dropping \~150x. And the stock still going up this morning. Bulls win. Again.

For those of us outside the grip of the ERDF, here is my take on the earnings: It was basically a used Kleenex being used by Elon to clean up his \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (you fill in the blank in the comments- make us laugh). It was the same old news being reused to wipe away the reality of a failing and desperate company.

**----End main post. Begin TLDR analysis. Don't read it if you are just going to complain----**

Below is one obvious fact, three used Kleenex, and what I see priced into the stock at this time:

**Fact:** Trump is indeed giving Elon the widely expected quid pro quo deal for buying him the White House. Remember the tariff ""news"" that was released right at the same time Tesla's horrid sales numbers were released a few weeks ago? Well, we got the same thing for the predictable dumpster fire of an earnings report yesterday. Trump is moving the macro elements in the markets by timing his ""tariff on/off"" switch to boost a single stock of the company owned by the person that got him elected. 

It's simple: Elon buys Trump the White House. Trump buys Elon more time to make is car company ""not-a-car-company"" by keeping the stock pumped. Elon is acting as a heat shield for Trump by doing the dirty work of cutting jobs with DOGE and Trump is acting as a heat shield for Tesla's stock. I bet we will see another White House sales special when the ""low cost"" car comes up for sale too.

**Used Kleenex #1:** ERDF has achieved FSD mode as long as Elon keeps his hand on the wheel 2-3 days out of the week for Tesla. The news that was already known by the law mandates the term for Special Advisors to the President be limited to 130-days per calendar year, was deployed again. This same (not actual news) news release was already made and already got the stock to pop. But Elon isn't really leaving. According to the man himself, he is still going to be splitting his time between DOGE and Tesla, giving each a few days a week. And don't forget about SpaceX, X, xAI, Neuralink, The Boring Company, 14-kids and counting, and all the other stuff he spends his time on like gaming. But trust him: He is really going to focus this time. Seriously guys. 

**Used Kleenex #2:** Tesla is now going to make that low cost EV that Elon called ""silly"" and ""pointless"" just a few months ago (Source: [Elon Musk Says Making a $25,000 EV Is ‘Silly’ and ‘Pointless’](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-says-making-25-144109165.html)). But this is not going to be a ""new"" car. This is going to be a stripped down version of a Model Y or 3 (Source: [Tesla’s Dirt-Cheap EV Might Just Be A Basic Model 3 Or Y](https://insideevs.com/news/757410/tesla-affordable-model-stripped-down/)). This will allow them to use the same production lines and just strip out as much as they can as fast as they can. 

This is looking more like a B-52 bomber that is running on fumes while the crew is frantically throwing as much out the window to drop weight before they crash and burn. It is clearly an act of desperation. Tesla is either doing upgrades to the same cars (e.g., the Juniper) or downgrades to the same cars. Nothing new. The only ""new"" think Tesla has done is the Cybertruck, which has been one of the biggest failures in automotive history. 

\*FYI: There is a low cost Tesla on the market. It's called a used Tesla. And there are plenty of them available right now. 

**Used Kleenex #3:** More empty promises of the same late-to-market vaporware. The cars will achieve full self-driving (FSD), the Robotaxi will launch, and Optimus will take over all tasks for humans everywhere. But not really. FSD will be diluted to something you need to assist and delays will be blamed on something other than Tesla's mismanagement (e.g., George Soros, red tape, etc.). About 10-20 older model Teslas with upgraded computers will start giving rides around Austin (probably to employees only). And the Optimus, for which there is no consumer market or supply chain for, will be doing a few things for a demo reel around the Tesla factory floor.  

How many times can Elon use the same Kleenex before the market throws it out? Your guess is as good as mine...

**Here is what is priced in:** Perfection, fruit fly brain, harder things being made easy, no risk, and no competition. 

The markets are signaling that Tesla management will masterfully navigate any brand damage with absolute perfection. Despite not having managed anything very well in the past, this is being seen as a complete non-issue for the company. Basically, the market is expecting all consumers to have the memory of a fruit fly and all of Elon's public chainsaw wielding insanity will blow over in a few months time. And of course, that he will not do or say anything stupid again after being unable to do so since his inception. Most importantly, no brand damage will affect any of the future products being launched this year (but not really) because consumers with the brain's of a fruit fly won't associate other Tesla products with Tesla. Makes sense right?

The only new Tesla has made in the vehicle space is the Cybertruck. They used glue to attach the body panels and it fell apart, requiring a 100% recall. It has been one of the worst failures in automotive history. Doing things like FSD, integrating AI, and making humanoid robots that seamlessly work alongside humans are astronomically more challenging by comparison. And we are supposed to believe that the company still can't build a vehicle with any level of acceptable quality after decades of trying will be able to pull off much harder technical challenges in just a few months? Makes sense right?

The markets are ignoring all competition and looking at Tesla as the only potential beneficiary of it's EVs and vaporware. BYD is very real in the EV space and has already taken over global sales without even having access to the US market. Toyota is about to be crushing it in the US EV market (do your own research- it's coming). They already have a low cost EV that is so popular in China it crashed their servers with so many people trying to order it (Source: [Meet Toyota’s cheapest EV in China, the bZ3X](https://electrek.co/2025/03/06/toyotas-cheapest-ev-china-crashes-server-starting-at-15000/)). Meanwhile, Tesla just has used Kleenex and a driving dumpster fire to offer.

That little tech company known as ""Google"" already has a robotaxi service up and running in cities across America with their company Waymo. They are way ahead. There is even more competition in this space such as Zoox. And there are already tech savvy taxi services available in Uber and Lyft. People can get a cab ride pretty easy these days. This space has very heavy competition already and Tesla is way behind but they are being valued as if they will be the first and only taxi service available. 

Again, the markets assume there will be no brand damage here. Why will consumers pick Tesla's Cybercab over everything else? Because they like getting flicked off while being driven somewhere? Let's be honest: Nothing will make you look cooler in America's predominantly left-leaning cities than stepping out of a Tesla Cybercab to meet your friends for dinner at your favorite restaurant. You will look even cooler if you throw your buddies an ""elbowless wave"" when you get out.  

Tesla's robotaxi effort is being viewed as ""no-risk"" endeavor. Basically, if Tesla launches, nothing could go wrong. GM's Cruise already learned this is not the case when they launched ahead of Tesla (Source: [GM’s Cruise Halts All US Robotaxi Service After Suspension for Pedestrian Who Was Dragged](https://www.wired.com/story/gms-cruise-halts-self-driving-operations-regulator-safety-fears/)). Given Tesla's track record of launching products before they are ready, do people really think nothing has the potential to go wrong here? Accidents happen. Even if the tech is better than humans, accidents will still happen. And Tesla will be an easy target with deep pockets for the blood sucking lawyers to go after. They are already settling wrongful death suits for their cars that are at least partially operated by humans (Source: [Tesla settles lawsuit over Autopilot crash that killed Apple engineer](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/08/tesla-settles-wrongful-death-lawsuit-over-fatal-2018-autopilot-crash.html)). Putting millions of self-driving robotaxis on the road all at once will only increase the odds and number of accidents. Without tort reform, accounting for losses due to litigation, this is likely to be a money losing endeavor and not the huge potential source of future profits the market is expecting it to be. 

Lastly, my favorite piece of vaporware: The Optimus robot. This rehash of the old ASIMO from Honda is the dumbest thing ever. There is absolutely no consumer market for this whatsoever. As Honda learned, the risks are huge here. As soon as these heavy robots lands on a human when they fall over and hurts them, it's game over. This will be a class action drool fest for the lawyers out there. I can see the billboards already: ""Have you been hurt by an Optimus? Call 1-800-SUE-ELON"". 

Tesla can't get cars with four-wheels to drive themselves down paved roads with painted lines on them. And they are somehow going to recreate a far more complex bipedal human that operates in free space with a robot using the same computer? Yeah, not going to happen except in vaporware demos using AI to generate imagery. This is ten years out at a minimum and would require a massive investment that has yet to be made. It is far more challenging than making EVs (even FSD EVs). Show me one of these robots walk into house with toys randomly scattered on the floor, unload groceries, and prepare a scrambled egg and I will eat my words (along with the egg). 

The commercial application for the Optimus is also nonsense with other competition already way out in front. BMW is working with company called Figure that is using it's second generation of humanoid robots to build cars in Spartanburg, SC (Source: [Humanoid Robots for BMW Group Plant Spartanburg](https://www.bmwgroup.com/en/news/general/2024/humanoid-robots.html)). And let's all conveniently forget the robots coming out of China (check them out for yourself). Again, Tesla is way behind here and being viewed as the only player in this space and the only potential beneficiary of any future humanoid robot. It's simply ridiculous. 

I end with this: The powerful ERDF is real and continues to provide Elon and Tesla with an endless supply of investors with exuberant and cult-like belief in anything he says that will willfully ignore reality along with all past performance and competition. Beware. ",62,50,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1k6wu0j/tesla_earnings_the_old_used_kleenex_trick_works/

2025-04-23 20:51:01,Alphabet,GOOGL,Tesla Robotaxi - Musk sees it as infinite money hack - My crude study gets profit of $18.57 per share if it entirely displaced Uber & Lyft.,"TESLA profits go **down** 70%, stock goes **up** 7%. Pretty inexplicable other than hopes and dreams propping it up.

A main component of the hopium is Musk continuing to dangle robotaxi out there. Notably, this is now the 11th years where Musk has ""hoped"" to have robotaxi in the next year (its shooting to have test robotaxis going in Austin in June, but there were some acknowledgments on the earnings call there would be remote operator standby assistance for those in case of issues, meaning it will not be a true robotaxi yet).

Musk continually touts robotaxi as a seemingly infinite money hack where there has ""never be anything like this rapid of value creation"" in the history of mankind. Nobody seems to be pushing back on this so let's see where we're at actually at with the value of a robotaxi. This is a crude study of how to value robotaxi.

**First,** Musk said on the earnings call that people will not own cars in the future; instead, everybody will just use robotaxis. I disagree with this. Even if robotaxis exist, if cars are still in the $20k to $50k range (which is already the case and EVs are getting cheaper), I expect most people that currently own a vehicle would still want to own one if they're still affordable - among other reasons, you would want to know you have a vehicle for your own personal use and is there when you want to use it, you may not want strangers sitting in your vehicle and farting in the seats all day etc.

From this perspective, it begins to look more like Tesla would be displacing Uber and Lyft - i.e., the current rideshare businesses - as opposed to literally everybody everywhere not owning a car and only using robotaxi.

**Second,** from a business component, and from Google searches, it appears as though Uber and Lyft charge, all-in, about $1.80/mile, with Uber and Lyft getting about a 30% cut, or $0.54 per mile. Uber and Lyft had a combined 2024 revenue of $49.7 billion. This would translate to **92.03 billion miles driven in 2024 across Uber and Lyft.**

**Third**, if we assume the robotaxi version Tesla manages to produce will cost about $25k, and dividing that by the average car lifespan of 160,000 miles (from a Google search), we get the cost per mile to build the robotaxi of $0.15 per mile.

**Fourth**, now, if we assume Tesla undercuts Uber and Lyft (as it would have to in order to take away their market share), and we assume Tesla undercuts them by 50%, then we end up with Tesla charging $0.90 per mile. Subtract out the $0.15 per mile of the cost of building the robotaxi and we end up with $0.65 per mile profit (this is a crude, and high approximation for profit as it ignores business overhead, maintenance expenses for the car, etc.).

At $0.65 per mile profit, and if it took all 99.4 billion miles that Uber and Lyft drove last year, that would mean Tesla **generates an annual profit off of robotaxis of $59.8 billion**. With Tesla having 3.22 billion shares outstanding, this would be **profit of $18.57 a share**. If we gave that **Uber's P/E ratio of 16** you end up with **$297 a share**.

**Summary**: If we approximated Tesla robotaxi as completely displacing Uber and Lyft - i.e., effectively the entire ride-share market - and Tesla undercut Uber and Lyft by charging for rides 50% as expensive as Uber and Lyft, and Tesla had a 70% profit margin on those rides, **could get $18.57 profit a share and at a P/E of 16 like Uber, would be a share price of $297.**

The share price/value creation potential actually is pretty significant, but, notably, even if it entirely displaced Uber and Lyft, a $297 share price would only be an 18% increase from where it is now at $250.

And, if robotaxi doesn't pan out in nearly the way Musk hopes, there is way more downside than the 30% upside as the fair value of Tesla from a car manufacturer perspective is probably under $100 per share, potentially under $50 a share.

Notably, this analysis does not factor in company and administrative expenses as to costs per mile for robotaxi, nor does it factor in that competition may drive Tesla ride prices lower than 50% of what Uber and Lyft are current charging - e.g., Waymo or other robotaxi services that will inevitably come about. Nor does it factor in Musk's Optimus robot nonsense as that is far, far too speculative. It also ignores the profits Tesla would make on cars it sold since, as recent earnings have shown, it's profit on car sales is now about $0.12 a quarter and would me marginal compared to the $18.57 a share profit from robotaxi.

 I'm not a Tesla fanboy. I was just curious if there's even some plausible route for Tesla to justify its valuation. The answer is there is a route where robotaxi could be lucrative enough to get there, although it's not very probable as it requires virtually no competition and for Tesla to actually deliver on robotaxi.

Something to think about. Curious people's take on this.",130,344,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1k6a1ck/tesla_robotaxi_musk_sees_it_as_infinite_money/
2025-04-23 14:56:00,Alphabet,GOOGL,Meta/Facebook expected to lose up to $7b USD in ad-revenue after China tells retailers like Shein/Temu to stop US ad spend due to trade war,"I didn't know that Chinese retailers bought Meta ads, but guess that makes sense since it includes Facebook but also Instagram.

The research note said that Chinese companies paid Meta/Facebook $18 billion in 2024 for ad revenue, which was 11% of Meta's total ad-revenue.

The note mentions that Beijing can instruct companies that are heavy spenders like Temu and Shein to pause ad spend with the American ad company, potentially costing Zuckerberg's ad giant up to $7 billion this year. I guess this is similar to telling the airlines to not accept Boeing planes anymore?  
I wonder if Google will also experience ad-cuts?

2025-04-22 15:36:08,Alphabet,GOOGL,Tesla Earnings: Two predictions and what to watch for after.,"Position: I am short on Tesla.

Apparently, Elon is going to talk today: [Elon Musk breaks his own Tesla (TSLA) earnings rule in desperate move](https://electrek.co/2025/04/21/elon-musk-breaks-tesla-tsla-earnings-rule-desperate-move/)

We all know what this is about: Building hype to distract from the endless onslaught of bad news for Tesla. Elon is going to deploy his ERDF (Elon Reality Distortion Field) to pump up his meme stock. This comes as no surprise to anyone here. 

Prediction #1: Taking the likely prediction from the Tesla bulls, Elon will tell investors the same old story of Tesla becoming ""not-a-car-company"" anymore and to completely ignore all of 2025. (Source: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2025-largely-doesnt-matter-tesla-113124531.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2025-largely-doesnt-matter-tesla-113124531.html) ). Also, not really a big stretch of the imagination here. 

Prediction #2: Just for fun, I will make a very specific prediction of how Elon will use his ERDF to dazzle the mouth breathers into dumping more money into his meme stock. I expect that he will roll out the Optimus. It will do the following tasks, in order:

1. Perform some silly preprogrammed maneuver that makes it look like it is self-aware. It will look at it's hands or something similar to make it look like it has ""intelligence"" and ""awareness"". Just watch the dumb video they have already put out there.
2. Elon will throw a bunch of small, non-fragile, objects out on a flat surface and say: ""*Now watch this!*"". 
3. The robot will quickly grab each small object, maybe something like a domino, and arrange them quickly in an ordered fashion. It might even flick the first one to knock down the chain. 
4. Controlled remotely by a human off stage, the robot will wave goodbye to a choreographed verbal prompt from Elon and then walk off the stage. Maybe it will even do a little dance for us. 
5. The bleating sheep will go nuts and the stock will pop. 
6. End sham demo. 
7. Begin hand-waving and tech-jargon spewing to explain away endless mounting problems for Tesla. 

I predict this because of Elon's long history of stage-hyped vaporware demos. This will be really easy for him to pull off because they can just rip a few sensors and software out of the common pick-and-place robots already used in their production lines and quickly cobble them into the Optimus. It is going to look just like the pre-canned routines production robots run at manufacturing trade shows but for dimwits that have never been to one and think this is all ""new"" technology. 

Most importantly: This will gloss over the inconvenient fact that any ""brand damage"" Elon has caused Tesla, will also surely impact the sales of any other consumer product they will launch in the future. For example, an obscenely expensive robot that will likely be unable to scramble an egg for you. 

The whole ""Tesla is not-a-car-company anymore"" earnings (so ignore the lack of earnings) show will also gloss over the fact that, like everything else ""new"" at Tesla, it is an old idea and they are way behind the competition (e.g., Waymo/Google in the Robotaxi space). The idea of a car company making humanoid robots was first put out there by Honda with ASIMO over a quarter century ago. They developed it. There was no consumer market for it. So, they repurposed it. There still isn't a consumer market here (longer discussion). And there is already a second generation of advanced humanoid robots for manufacturing from a company called [Figure building BMW's in Spartanburg, SC](https://www.bmwgroup.com/en/news/general/2024/humanoid-robots.html). Let's also just ignore all the more advanced humanoid robots coming out of China just like we are told to ignore BYD that just surpassed Tesla without even having access to the US market. If Elon says it's the future, it ""Musk"" be true, and Tesla will somehow be the ***only*** company in the world doing it. 

Will Tesla's stock pop today? Probably. But who really knows with any meme stock. Performance and numbers haven't mattered at all in the past for Tesla. Retail investors are just a herd of bleating sheep that will easily get caught up in the ERDF. What I am going to be looking for is 45 days from the end of Q1 when the data from the 13F Forms comes out. Watching what the big institutional investors are doing will really be telling. I strongly suspect, given previous reports of retail investors buying up [Tesla like never before](https://www.investopedia.com/why-teslas-stock-soars-despite-car-sales-numbers-11705040), that the institutional investors are going to slowly reduce their positions in Tesla and orchastate themselves a nice soft landing on the backs of gullible retail investors. Given that institutional investors hold about half the company, I predict that this news is what will really drive the stock price for the foreseeable future.

2025-04-20 08:58:10,Alphabet,GOOGL,Industries of the Future,"Which industries are currently still in their infancy but have great potential for the future?

If you google this question, unfortunately, you get very standard answers that I can't really relate to. Of course, industries like AI and semiconductors are important, and logistics will also grow—that's all clear to me. But what I'm talking about are actually ""hidden"" champions. In other words, not particularly well-known sectors.

My contribution to the topic would be, for example, the space industry. Companies like RocketLab and ASTS can make significant progress here. Even if it's just for research; the desire to understand more and explore space is definitely there. Do you have any other companies on your radar?

Or quantum computers and their associated counterpart, cybersecurity. But which companies have potential here? Are the ball only in the hands of well-known industry giants, or do small companies really have a chance?

Do you have any other ideas? Are you perhaps seeing a change in your career, a future branch of the industry? Which stocks would you recommend?

2025-04-19 06:17:49,Alphabet,GOOGL,This market is really not behaving well. Where do we most likely go from here?,"I think traders and close market analysts realize this more than many people do. From a technical standpoint of course, but a fundamental one.
Fundamental I mean - The concerns that the market was overvalued in the first place... And that trump was going to drop a bomb on the market and dollar itself in some way, shape or form. The foregone conclusion by MSM when the bearish market began in early March that it was just tariffs and trump, or ""still a bull market"" as portrayed by cnbc and then by more MSM once we dropped more than 5 percent. The fact more people than now rely more on retirement appreciation - many times a sign of or near a market top. The talk of depression, parallels to Hoover, Smoot - Hawley, etc. I seriously doubt I honestly was the only one who had my strongest worries since when covid was emerging (but this time feels worse...)

Some concerning features to me are the number of new investors /traders who keep thinking 2020 and 2022 bottoms were like this and now more than ever I'm hearing (accurately ) big drops feel scary, and they always recover. They don't have to always, it's just that they recently have. 

So yeah, I guess that's the question. I don't have a crystal ball of where we are going, but where is it most likely to go? The price action last week was fairly flat-for this market. (down 8 pts on SPY) , but felt genuinely mostly worse than that. Worse case-I fear there will be an added crisis fueled by Trump in the near term or something else internal/ external but important - causing a severe down leg once again. Perhaps that could be poor earnings next week with added economic concerns, Trump firing powell and wrecking the dollar and markets more, or more countries forming ""anti USA"" trade alliances. Best case? Do we move flat in a kangaroo market? Is there significant upside potential if strong earnings come in? I've asked myself the last question a lot, and normally I'd say yes, but now I doubt that, or that the risk/reward will be skewed severely to the downside.

This is kind of the first generalized thing I've felt I could say with any degree of confidence in a while. I could look like a stupid fool a year from now, but maybe not. 

Here's what I've done that's not in any way trading related.  I'm adding to foreign businesses and bonds. For a larger non trading account that can't take heavy risk, that's not my own per se we bought German bonds and more Nokia stock. The bonds are up 5 percent due to the euro, and Nokia is flat. I like Nokia's business as they are not exposed to the tariff nonsense and have big contracts to provide 4g in developing countries still on older networks. This is huge business for them. I'm keeping the Berkshire position, I added to it last year, although I'm a bit surprised by its resilience so far, though I also kept Google (it's doing much worse than I would've expected) but sold two other tech stocks, aapl and Msft. Sold apple when I realized how much Berkshire itself had dumped of apple. Sold Msft because comparably it seemed more expensive and vulnerable in this downturn I thought was likely.



There's a school of thought that says ""markets aren't supposed to make us always feel comfortable"" and that this is why long term holders, ten or more years, will ""always"" or almost always be rewarded as a result. That's generally, but not always been accurate for the past 50 years.
Another consideration:what do you personally feel most of the public feels who have moderate stock exposure? I'm talking like portfolios of $50,000-$500,000. Some of these people may not pay attention to the markets much, but would be overly concerned of a significant market drop. They may just own etfs, or general retail investors. I personally feel many of these people are not overly concerned right now. ",248,289,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1k2psh8/this_market_is_really_not_behaving_well_where_do/

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2025-04-17 14:35:39,Alphabet,GOOGL,How to bet on GOOG GenAI ?,"I’m using various gen AI tools since gpt-2 and stable diffusion. Until last year I was assuming OpenAI and MSFT will be the winner.

Yesterday I just witnessed Google’s breakthrough with image and video generation while tinkering with their new experiment. The more I think, the more the following scenario makes sense:

* Google has unlimited access to YouTube, which gives them edge over others on training video related GenAI

* YouTube has already a proven business model based on user created content with ads or subscription.

* I can see that with GenAI tools from Google, it’ll be possible for people to create “professional” content; short movies, series, animes. Some of them will be hits.

* End game, YouTube will take a big portion from the movie/series market, both watching and also production.

* At some point this might mean big studios and distribution channels (including Netflix) will loose some market to YouTube.

* I expect this to become visible by the end of 2026: A couple of GenAI series, created by a very small team (say 5-10). No actors, just skilled labor.

* I expect the quality and quantity to increase in the next 3-5 years

Based on this outlook, I’m just thinking to simply buy Google stock. But I’m stupid and whenever I buy stock, I loose money. What could I do? Is YouTube important enough for Google that this might boost the stock value?

2025-04-16 17:55:58,Alphabet,GOOGL,OpenAI Just Showed Nvidia Bear Case Misunderstands the Reality of AI Scaling - $NVDA,"I keep seeing this recurring bearish argument that “more efficient models” like DeepSeek will reduce the need for massive compute, and therefore hurt Nvidia. That thesis simply doesn’t hold up to scrutiny — especially in light of OpenAI’s latest announcement today.

Take a look at the AIME performance chart from OpenAI’s new frontier model (o3). It shows a **direct, consistent correlation between compute usage and model performance**. More compute = better models. Full stop. No tricks, no shortcuts.

[https://imgur.com/a/MU2z77b](https://imgur.com/a/MU2z77b)

Yes, we’re seeing architectural improvements that increase training efficiency. But these gains don’t shrink the pie — **they expand it**. Every efficiency gain is reinvested into building even larger and more capable models. This is the scaling law trend, and Nvidia is at the center of it.

Now to DeepSeek: impressive optimization work, but let’s be real — their model is just riding on top of the massive foundation Nvidia enabled. DeepSeek’s “efficiency” is only relevant because **they still needed access to high-end GPUs to train it in the first place**. No one is training SOTA on CPUs or low-cost commodity hardware. Every frontier model — whether from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or DeepSeek — relies on Nvidia’s stack to get off the ground.

Here’s the bullish reality:

* Model performance still scales with compute — OpenAI just showed us that again.
* Efficient models don’t kill GPU demand; they unlock **even more ambitious models** and **more widespread deployments**.
* Inference is exploding. Every assistant, every copilots, every agent… all of them need sustained GPU access.
* Nvidia has built a full-stack moat: CUDA, TensorRT, networking, and ecosystem lock-in.

The smarter argument isn’t that Nvidia demand will fall — it’s that demand will **explode in more directions**: training, inference, on-device, edge. Efficient models don’t reduce Nvidia’s relevance. They increase the number of use cases and drive **horizontal expansion** of AI compute.",20,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1k0qunb/openai_just_showed_nvidia_bear_case/

[Gold](https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/investing/article/gold-price-today-wednesday-april-16-2025-gold-opens-with-new-high-134956304.html) has surpassed the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks as the most crowded trade on Wall Street as the precious metal surged to record highs this year amid volatile markets and an uncertain economic backdrop.

According to the latest Bank of America fund managers survey published this week, nearly half of the fund managers surveyed (49%) see long gold, or bets that gold prices will rise, as the most crowded trade in the market right now. This marks the first time in two years that fund managers did not see the Magnificent Seven as Wall Street's most crowded trade, according to the survey.

Gold futures ([GC=F](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GC=F/)) on Wednesday rose to an all-time high of $3,334 as investors continued to [favor the safe-haven asset](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-notches-best-week-since-2020-amid-shaken-investor-confidence-in-us-201546983.html) amid a falling US dollar ([DX-Y.NYB](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/DX-Y.NYB/__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!HIhgXKgPRojUSTTqYlaKSTMqCnabU-_BFJYcQNg1l9bJcllZ1Gp3LtN-1O0pcbknpYvKz0DBczt7-zHHf99GDzXJ1VfxDc7wuw$)) and tariff uncertainty.

Gold prices have surged more than 27% year to date, while the Magnificent Seven tech stocks — Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)), Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL), [GOOG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG)), Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)), Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)), Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)), Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)), and Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) — are down considerably.

Tesla stock has led Magnificent Seven losses and is down about 38% since the start of 2025. Apple stock has fallen 21%.

Nvidia stock has also declined 21% year to date. On Wednesday,[ the AI chip giant warned of a multibillion-dollar ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-dives-as-chipmaker-sees-55-billion-hit-from-surprise-china-chip-controls-130319576.html)impact from US export controls on China, which weighed on shares.

Shares of Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon — the remainder of the Magnificent Seven — are all down by double-digit percentages since the start of the year.

Gold's rally comes as [central banks' demand hit all-time highs](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-demand-hits-record-levels-as-central-banks-buy-at-eye-watering-pace-205945413.html) last year and as investors increased inflows into physical gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

""The new highs in gold are signaling a shift in appetite for US assets,"" Ryan McIntyre, senior managing partner at asset manager firm Sprott, recently told Yahoo Finance.

""Confidence in the US has clearly been shaken, so people are looking to diversify.""

Wall Street analysts have remained bullish on gold, [upping their price forecasts ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-keeps-upping-its-bullish-calls-on-gold--heres-why-162732492.html)on the precious metal even amid its fast ascent.

Some 42% of fund managers expect gold will be the best-performing asset of 2025, up from 23% in March, according to Bank of America.

The firm's survey also showed investors have rotated out of US assets by a record amount over the past two months, with 73% of respondents saying ""US exceptionalism"" has peaked.",449,54,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1k0nih7/after_surge_to_record_highs_gold_overtakes/

# Key Takeaways

* Netflix shares jumped Tuesday after a report company executives laid out ambitious targets at a business review meeting last month.
* The streaming giant aims to double its revenue by 2030 and reach a market capitalization of $1 trillion, *The* *Wall Street Journal* reported Monday.
* Netflix is set to report first-quarter results after the market closes Thursday.

Netflix (NLFX) shares jumped Tuesday following a report company executives laid out ambitious targets at a business review meeting last month.

Executives said the streaming giant aims to double the $39 billion in revenue Netflix brought in last year, with a global ad sales target of $9 billion by 2030, *The* *Wall Street Journal* reported Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The streaming giant also aims to reach a [market capitalization](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp) of $1 trillion by 2030, the report said, up from roughly $419.2 billion. The only U.S. companies with a market cap above $1 trillion today include Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B).

Netflix did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Shares were up more than 5% in recent trading Tuesday, leading gains on the S&P 500. They've added about 60% of their value over the past 12 months. (Read *Investopedia's* live coverage of [today's market action here](https://www.investopedia.com/dow-jones-today-04152025-11715325).)

Last week, Morgan Stanley analysts named Netflix a [“top pick,”](https://www.investopedia.com/netflix-a-top-pick-for-morgan-stanley-on-expected-resilience-to-a-weaker-market-11712037) arguing the company could be well-positioned to withstand the current tariff landscape. The streaming giant has shown ""momentum” in its core subscription business, the analysts said. That momentum lowers the company’s overall risk, the bank added, even if the advertising market struggles amid rising trade tensions.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

* [Call option Investopedia video](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp) basically a call option allows you to buy 100 shares of a stock at a certain price (strike price), but without the obligation to buy
* [Put option Investopedia video](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putoption.asp) a put option allows you to sell 100 shares of a stock at a certain price (strike price), but without the obligation to sell
* Writing options switches the obligation to you and you'll be forced to buy someone else's shares (writing puts) or sell your shares (writing calls)

2025-04-09 19:51:34,Alphabet,GOOGL,It's a bull trap!,"So, how much pain are the bears really feeling right now? I bet you're trying to convince yourselves this rally is just a bull trap... Well, who knows? Maybe it is, maybe it isn't. And that is precisely the problem: you invest by trying to predict the future, which is exactly why you're doomed to fail.

I told you not to follow the news – it's proven to be a losing strategy in the long run – but you argued it wasn't true. I told you sentiment was extremely negative and the smart move was to buy something, but you countered that it could drop even more. You listed a thousand reasons why buying was madness, yet here I am with my Google position up 8% and various ETFs also well in the green.

The only rule that truly matters is: extreme fear = buy, extreme euphoria = sell. It's incredibly simple, yet you just can't seem to follow it.

You can bet your ass that if the market crashes again, your first thought will be, 'See? I was right not to buy!' But NO! You have to fight that instinct. Stop overthinking every possible future outcome and just be contrarian. You need to look like the idiot, the madman throwing their money away.

The Fear & Greed Index hit 4! Do you realize how significant that is? Reaching 4 is incredibly rare, and you just sat there watching – or worse, you sold. That was a massive mistake. Next time we hit levels like that, make damn sure you buy something. **Even a small amount – just buy.**

Dude drops tariffs, tanks the market, then tweets “**THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY**!!!” right after — and magically, his own stock pops premarket like a toaster pastry. Isn’t that textbook market manipulation? Or does shouting in all caps make it legal now?

If any other CEO did this, the SEC would’ve already parked a van outside their house. But when Trump does it, it’s just another Tuesday on Twitter.

Is there a hotline? A Google Form? A carrier pigeon I can send to the SEC?

2025-04-09 15:11:15,Alphabet,GOOGL,Current state of the stock market and what to do,"I'm 21, I know very little about investing or the stock market, and have never invested before, but from everything I've seen and read over the past couple days or weeks, now seems to be a pretty good time to invest into some stocks while everything is at a lower price then what it was before

I have about 1-2k that I could invest which yeah people might laugh at that cause maybe its not a lot but its just what I have and what I can do, and I would be ok with investing it knowing that the stocks potentially go even lower, knowing eventually it will hopefully recover but I figure might as well do it now instead of waiting trying to time the market and losing out on the ""sale"". I figure I could buy a bit of Apple, NVidia, Meta, Google stuff like that that's generally pretty safe but is on sale, am I right about that, or the S&P500.

So a couple questions I have:

1. What platform or app should I use to buy stocks, is robinhood good? Some of my friends use it, if not what to use

2. Lets say I have 2k to invest should I do it separately over 2 weeks, or over 2 months, or $500 a week, or all at once?

3. Is there any measure I need to take when buying a stock, do I just buy it and its there in the platform until the day I take it out?

4. Best things to invest in, or from your experiance best thing to invest in? As I mentioned above those are kind of the stocks I figure id try and get a couple of

5. Any other general advice you can give id appreciate, again not trying to do to much or go all in on stocks but I figured again I have some extra money id rather invest while the market is down then just have it be sitting doing nothing

50+ countries negotiating. It's all part of the game!

b) Yes the top 8% of Richest people own 80% of the stock market...  which means you can be sure of ONE thing... And that is they're going to make sure it pumps back up eventually.

2025-04-07 02:59:54,Alphabet,GOOGL,Lets speak about inflation S&P 500 points and how all this is gonna play for the small investor,"So basically, I'm crunching numbers tonight to figure out my approach for the coming months.

The S&P 500 closed at 4,766 points on December 31, 2021. Today, it's at 5,075—though we could be much lower by tomorrow night. That’s a gain of just 6.46% over 3 years and 97 days.

On the inflation side:

* In 2022, the US inflation rate peaked at 8.00%,
* Then dropped to 4.12% in 2023,
* And further eased to 2.9% in 2024.

**SOFT LANDING**… I honestly miss hearing those two words.

If we compound those three numbers, the average American has lost about **15.7%** of their purchasing power.

So, if you bought the index in the last days of 2021, you’d be roughly **-9%** in real terms today—and probably worse off in the coming weeks or months.

I wouldn’t be surprised to see the index drop to 3,800 or even 3,500. But it simply *can’t* go much lower. The earnings are solid, and inflation has inflated those earnings too. Many companies will maintain their value, especially since a lot of them generate revenue outside the US.

That said, the system will recover. Practically the entire world relies on US companies. Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Google are in homes across the globe—billions of people use them daily for work or socializing. The same goes for manufacturers like CAT, Deere, KO, Pepsi, etc.

We’ll be fine. The system will reset, and eventually, we’ll return to profitability. Again, billions of people depend on a healthy US economy. Capitalism isn’t collapsing anytime soon.

My friends speak broken Chinese say it is very hard to communicate with them via phone (due to language), and have to use google translate a lot during their emails. TLDR it’s a pain in the ass to find new clients both as an importer / exporter

Currently the exporters are working together to try to meet in the middle, 15-35 percent more per product to pay at the ports. If my friend does not raise prices he will lose ~30 percent profit. One example is selling a household decorative item on Amazon for $39. 

They are thinking of trying to meet in the middle and only lose 15-20 percent profit and hope this all blows over soon.

Sad to see everyone from exporter importer and consumer (only if sellers raise their prices) losing money, just some thoughts.

However, I noticed that most of them went down around 20-25 percent ( Amazon slightly more), which seems everything went down the same. And that is not 100 percent logical.

If stock prices are going down because of probable less revenue and less profits, these drops in my view should not be the same.

1. Apple - 75 percent revenue are hardware. Almost all of it done abroad. Apple should be heavily negatively influenced from tarrifs, and in fact its one of the “better” ones with a fall of around 20-22 percent or so. 

2. Amazon - as mentioned Amazon went down more than Apple from a similar stock price of cca 230 dollars. This is because of the China trade war, and for Amazon I see an exception to my analysis.
3. Alphabet - I did not really check in detail. Shouldnt most od their revenue be services and nothing to do with tariffs? 
Alphabet/Google went from 200 to now 144. Thats again more than 25 percent.

4. META - again, what do they have to do with tariffs?
Drop around same like Google, a bit less.

5. Microsoft - again same as Alphabet and Google. Should it be really?

Tesla is out of my analysis since it was never really deeply connected to the rest in growth and fall.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2025-04-03 18:13:52,Alphabet,GOOGL,"Apple sheds $300 billion in tariff-fueled sell-off, on track for worst drop since March 2020","[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-sheds-300-billion-in-tariff-fueled-sell-off-on-track-for-worst-drop-since-march-2020-175727479.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-sheds-300-billion-in-tariff-fueled-sell-off-on-track-for-worst-drop-since-march-2020-175727479.html)

Tech stocks plummeted on Thursday, with Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)) leading ""Magnificent Seven"" names lower following President Trump's[ reciprocal tariff announcement](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-every-country-facing-reciprocal-tariffs-announced-by-trump-on-liberation-day-231329935.html) the day prior.

Shares of Apple, on track for their worst day since March 2020, cratered over 8% in afternoon trade as the stock erased $300 billion from its market cap. The largest risk, according to analysts, centers on the iPhone maker's overseas production hubs, which are particularly vulnerable to the tariffed countries.

On Wednesday, Trump announced tariffs that will impact some 185 countries, including the United States's largest trading partners. Additional reciprocal tariffs, for instance, will include 34% tariffs on Chinese imports, a 20% tariff on European Union imports, a 46% tariff on imports from Vietnam, 32% on imports from Taiwan, and 26% on India — all set to take effect on April 9.

Notably, the additional 34% tax on China will be added to the country's existing 20% tariff, meaning its total tariff rate will rise to 54%. China is Apple's most important [production hub](https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook-apple-supply-chain-trump-tariffs-china-diversify-iphone-2025-1?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=yahoo.com), with about 85% of its iPhones manufactured there.

""Apple produces basically all their iPhones in China, and the question will be around exceptions and exemptions on this tariff policy if those companies are building more operations, factories, and plants in the US[ like Apple announced in February](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-will-spend-more-than-500-billion-usd-in-the-us-over-the-next-four-years/),"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients following the announcement.

As trade tensions escalate, Apple has moved to increase its supply chain beyond just China, boosting manufacturing in places like India and Vietnam. But with the new tariff announcements set to impact those countries too, there's now limited room for reprieve.

""The worry will be around pricing and margin impacts along with what this means for the global supply chain looking forward,"" Ives said. For now, the analyst continues to believe major negotiations will happen over the coming months as companies attempt to navigate ""this new world of tariffs.""

Until then, he warned, ""tech stocks will clearly be under major pressure.""

Other Magnificent Seven players also faced significant selling action. In aggregate, that cohort of stocks is currently on track to eliminate over $800 billion from their collective market caps.

In afternoon trade, Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)) and Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) each fell 7%, followed by a 6% drop in both Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL)) and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)). Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)) dipped 3%, while Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)) was off just under 2%.

Outside of the Mag Seven, chip stocks faced similar declines, despite the exemption of semiconductors from Trump's additional tariffs. Nvidia competitor Broadcom ([AVGO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AVGO)), for example, erased well over $50 billion from its market cap following an 8% drop in shares.

""The implications \[of the announced tariffs\] are broad-reaching, and we see negative implications for the whole \[chip\] sector,"" KeyBanc analyst John Vinh wrote in a note to clients. ""These are most notably going to negatively impact end-demand in key markets including smartphones/iPhones and PCs, as a significant amount of manufacturing is done within China.""

Stacy Rasgon, Bernstein's managing director and senior analyst, added in an interview with Yahoo Finance that the biggest headwind for semiconductors is not necessarily the direct impact of tariffs. Rather, it's the risk of demand destruction as these products become more expensive.

He added, ""The other risk for semis is that they are very cyclical, very global, and very correlated to the macro and to GDP. [So if this tips us into recession, ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-economy-dangerously-vulnerable-to-recession-wall-street-reacts-to-tariff-fallout-155837444.html)that's probably not going to be great.""",215,63,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jqpre5/apple_sheds_300_billion_in_tarifffueled_selloff/

This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

**Stay agile, and be on the lookout for tariff news from Beijing.**

News: [Trump's Tariff Announcement](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2025-04-02/trump-s-tariff-announcement)

[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\- 34% tariff on Chinese imports, adding to existing duties, brings the total to 54% effective April 9. AAPL relies heavily on Chinese manufacturing, and these tariffs are expected to lead to increased production costs, which will be passed on to consumers through higher prices. Watching $200, but likely the stock I'm going to play if there's any chance of a bounce (in addition to NVDA). These tariffs will result in retaliatory measures from China, further impacting Apple's supply chain and profitability. Additionally, prolonged tariffs could lower consumer demand due to higher prices. Related Tickers: AVGO, SWKS, TSM, QCOM.

[**CRWV (CoreWeave)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRWV&p=d)\- Google is reportedly in advanced discussions to rent Nvidia's Blackwell AI servers from CoreWeave. This potential partnership is huge because it means that CRWV has a little more diversification in their revenue stream (alleviating a huge risk to the company). It's hard, this has risen so much from the IPO but we're back at pre-tariff and pre-announcement prices- have a small long position but likely will exit due to all the craziness today and need to focus on the bigger fish. Despite Taiwanese chips not being tariffed, CRWV will likely benefit due to the rising costs of chips.

[**RH (Restoration Hardware)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RH&p=d)\- Reported EPS of $1.58 vs $1.92 expected. Revenue of $812M vs $829M. The company issued guidance for the current fiscal year, projecting revenue growth of 10% to 13%, an adjusted operating margin between 14% and 15%, and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 20% to 21%. Management highlighted concerns over a higher-risk business environment due to tariffs, market volatility, and inflation risks, noting that RH has been operating in the ""worst housing market in almost 50 years."" Interested at $150, but won't focus on this today vs AAPL or other Mag7 names that are selling off.

[**VXX (VIX Short-Term Futures ETN)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&p=d)\- The recent spike in volatility attributed to ""Liberation Day"" saw a massive VIX spike along with everything else selling off. Interested in seeing what we do but I doubt today will be the day I take a short position- volatility is coming and is not as likely to be the quick one-day spikes we've seen in the past. We may see additional tariffs from China in retaliation.

[**NKE (Nike)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NKE&p=d)\- Nike is one of the biggest losers due to tariffs, as a substantial portion of its manufacturing is based in Southeast Asian countries facing high tariff rates. Notably, Nike produces nearly 50% of its footwear and 30% of its apparel in Vietnam. Currently long, but will bail if we break new lows (\~$55.20). Prolonged tariffs lead to higher consumer prices, and NKE has cited lowered demand/guidance for its goods due to competitors.

[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\- NVIDIA's exposure to the recent tariff announcements appears limited, as the 32% levy on imports from Taiwan. The White House clarified that semis are exempt from these tariffs, which provides a buffer for NVIDIA's core business and limits downside risk from the new trade measures. We still saw a 6% move post-tariff announcement.",1,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jqi2wj/interesting_stocks_today_043_liberation_day/

2025-04-02 06:47:15,Alphabet,GOOGL,"Tesla Hidey Hole (Richmond, VA)- Don't believe the numbers tomorrow but the ERDF is real.","Before I jump into the stock related stuff, as an old, I feel it is important to preface this with a little cautionary advice. Here is my three points of ""don't be stupid"":

1. I know Richmond has a storied history of burning shit going all the way back to the Civil War- but don't burn any Teslas. It's not worth it. And it's stupid. Furthermore, you are putting first responders at risk. You will also likely get caught. At least here in Virginia, there are [cameras everywhere](https://cardinalnews.org/2025/03/28/i-drove-300-miles-in-rural-virginia-then-asked-police-to-send-me-their-public-surveillance-footage-of-my-car-heres-what-i-learned/) and Tesla's themselves will record you. It's just not worth throwing your life away no matter how mad you might be. Before you get labeled a domestic terrorist and thrown in an El Salvadorian prison, read some Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and get some perspective. He wrote from a Russian gulag after sharing his negative opinion of Stalin. We are currently on Reddit and nobody is going to jail for it.
2. Don't harass individual Tesla owners. They didn't do anything to deserve it and most likely hate what is happening as well. I know some of them. It is unreasonable to ask them to dump their daily driver at a huge loss because Elon decided to make himself into a human lighting rod.
3. I deliberately waited for the ""Tesla Takedown"" to be over before making this post so nobody would get any bright ideas. What you think is making a difference is likely to have the opposite effect from what you are hoping for. The people trying to stick it to Trump just got him more [support from billionaires](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckvvlv3lewxo) after he was convicted and if you didn't notice, $TSLA started deep in the red yesterday after the Tesla Takedown over the weekend and rallied way back and finished considerably up today. None of that moved the needle in any direction but up. Furthermore, if you burn or vandalize a Tesla, the insurance company will pay for it and just jack up all of our rates in turn. If any destroyed cars are still owned by Tesla, they will just use accounting methods to write it off. And that is one less car they don't have to sell at a time when they aren't selling many, which is the ultimate point of this post and makes a nice segue.

If you are mad about what Elon Musk is doing, or just want to make money on your $TSLA puts (like me- position disclosed), what sends a stronger message? A few burnt up Teslas or entire parking lots full of them because nobody wants to buy them? In my opinion, as well as [others with puts](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/nick-denton-interview-thiel-musk) on Tesla and think Elon has lost it, it is the latter. Speaking of which... I found one such parking lot!

First, check out the few pictures I took of the local Tesla dealership here in Richmond (just outside the city). Their lot is clearly over capacity but nothing jaw dropping. There are a few dozen vehicles on the street and in a neighboring parking lot. After I shared these with a few friends, one of them told me that there were vehicle transporters unloading new Teslas near his work, which is a few miles away from the dealership and in an area of office buildings that have nothing to do with Tesla. I checked it out and there are a lot of them stuffed in the back of the lot. It's hard to see because I took the pictures at night and the cars are spread out but there are easily over 20 Cybertrucks and probably somewhere near 50 vehicles in total.

Hidey Hole-3: [https://imgur.com/Ay3oTZh](https://imgur.com/Ay3oTZh)

Obviously, my local dealer isn't selling enough cars to keep up with their deliveries (no surprise to anyone). But the big question I have is: Are these vehicles considered ""delivered""? Tomorrow Tesla reports how many vehicles they have ""delivered"" (not the same as sold). And if you haven't been paying attention as of late, Tesla has had some questionable practices going on in [Canada with their sales](https://fortune.com/2025/03/26/elon-musk-tesla-under-investigation-canada-wrongfully-boosting-sales/) and some possible questions raised about their accounting methods with the [$1.4 billion discrepancy](https://mashable.com/article/tesla-missing-billion-dollars) in their books. Going back a little further, there was a whistleblower that reported [Tesla deliberately messes](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/12/tesla-whistleblowers-filed-complaint-to-sec-in-2021-what-it-said.html) with their delivery numbers to make it appear as if they are selling more new cars than they really are.

Point being, no matter what is reported tomorrow, I am not going to believe the numbers Tesla provides. If there are new Teslas being shoved into an obscure parking lot in my city, it has to be happening elsewhere. At some point, I suspect the vehicle overflow will get noticed in other places too. Has anyone else found a Tesla hidey hole?

Most importantly, even if the number suck tomorrow, I doubt it will make that much of a difference in the stock price because of the ERDF. What is the ERDF you ask? It is the ""Elon Reality Distortion Field"" (ERDF). And this incredibly powerful field effect is really all that matters when it comes to anything ""Elon"". It's real. And people should acknowledge it as such or risk their own peril. Nothing logical or sane applies to Elon Musk and it never has.

Edit/Update: Despite missing on deliveries, $TSLA is not really down that much. Everything is being affected from the tariff news so any impact isn't really noticeable. And the sales miss is being explained away by the Model Y refresh, as widely expected and foretold by just about every media outlet covering Tesla. No surprises in the ERDF holding $TSLA strong despite the bad news.

But not Elon. In fact, just the opposite occurred. He became, and remains to be, the richest man on Earth. This displays the tremendous power of the ERDF- It is nothing like the world has ever seen. Even more powerful than [Jewish Space Lasers](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/marjorie-taylor-greene-qanon-wildfires-space-laser-rothschild-execute.html).

The ERDF is by far and away Elon's greatest invention and achievement. If there are two things Elon should get tremendous credit for, it is knowing when to invest in the right things and building hype around them. The guy is a six-dimensional hype machine from outer space with uncanny prescience. From PayPal to SpaceX, he saw where future opportunity was being underinvested in and took it over. When it comes to Tesla, he even knew when to make it ""not a car company"". Using the power of the ERDF, he made it an AI, self-driving vehicle, taxi, and humanoid robot company just in the nick of time before sales of their actual product fell off a cliff. This company is now known as ""Tessler"". Now, it doesn't matter if they sell any cars at all. Elon is using the ERDF to sell the future and even control the presidency. And it's working. It sounds crazy as hell but we are all watching this happen in real life.

Amazingly, the ERDF has allowed Elon to stall indefinitely on all promises of delivering the future and show absolutely no meaningful results for over a half-decade. Nor is Tesla a first mover in any of their new initiatives. Waymo (Google) has already launched self-driving taxis that are available using Uber and even in buzzing around in Austin Texas, where Tesla is headquartered. The idea of humanoid robots has been around forever. And one behemoth of a car company already developed one. But that happened over a quarter century ago. The car company was Honda and the robot was called ASIMO. And nobody cared. They discontinued it in 2018. Elon's ""Optimus"" has only been seen to do preprogrammed demos that look like Boston Dynamics routines from the early 2000's (nobody cares about them either). They have also been spotted shuffling around like Joe Biden. Neither the Robotaxi or Optimus robot are anywhere close to being released. And I have strong doubts as to what utility, if any, the Optimus robot will have for anybody. All of this seems to be a distraction created by the ERDF to draw attention away from the fact that Tesla still hasn't achieved ""full"" self-driving (and [ignored LIDAR sensors](https://cleantechnica.com/2025/03/17/lidar-vs-cameras-a-giant-fail-for-tesla/)). I am expecting Elon to come out with a ""Fred Flintstone"" sedan next, with no floor that you power with your feet, and telling everyone that it will be the future of travel. If Elon says it, then it ""Musk"" be true (the guy has a name that just keeps on giving).

With no first-mover advantage in the driverless taxi space, being behind tech giant Google there, and reviving an old failed sci-fi robot idea from their much larger and more established competitor in Honda, you would think Tesla would get graded down for unoriginality. But nope. The ERDF kicks in yet again and [most analysts are bullish](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/teslas-stock-dives-as-another-bullish-analyst-worries-about-deliveries-5e90f869) and astonishingly, Cathy Wood, seemingly most affected by the ERDF (and other things that make people stupid), thinks Tesla stock is going to reach an astounding [$2,600 in five short years](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/cathie-wood-reaffirms-tesla-2-212612251.html)! That's about 10x more valuable than it is today, giving Tesla a market cap somewhere around $8.5 trillion dollars. That would make Tesla more valuable than all the other major auto manufacturers, Uber, Lyft, Google, Amazon, and Nvidia, combined in today's market (with a trillion to spare). Does that sound realistic? You can call me a skeptic of Cathy Wood...

Again, make no mistake, the ERDF is real. And if we are talking straight stock price, it matters. It might be the only thing that matters. Love him or hate him, it seems that Elon and his ERDF manufactured the most successful ad campaign in history right on the lawn of the White House. But it wasn't for the cars. It was for the stock. All the new people getting sucked into the ERDF because of Elon's new found bromance with Trump have no idea of what has been happening with Elon prior to his involvement in politics. And they don't care. They just know him as ""Tech Support"" guy and Trump's new ally. They love Trump and there is no shortage of them. They might be willing to wait another 5-years for Cathy's insane prediction to come true, not knowing everyone else had already been waiting for 5-years before them. Fresh meat so-to-speak. Tesla's 10-day average volume is over 138 million shares. And most of this is [retail traders going bonkers](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-21/tesla-s-retail-fanboys-buy-the-stock-at-a-pace-never-seen-before?embedded-checkout=true) for Tesla and Elon. It is likely that Elon has masterfully used his ERDF to transition retail stock holders from younger, tech savvy and/or environmentally conscious investors to straight up Fox News Dads in less than one quarter.

While it has already been noted on this sub that institutional investors are likely pumping $TSLA to orchestrate a soft landing for themselves (on the backs of retail investors), I don't think they can exit too quickly without causing a complete fiasco. They only have to report 30-days after each quarter ends and they trade in dark pools. So, we plebeians won't know what the big institutional holders are doing until after they have done it (unless they report sooner). And if any one big institutional investor dumps their position fast enough to spook the market, there will certainly be consequences. Both political and financial. The finances between Elon, his many ventures, and his personal loans must be a complete nightmare of both complexity and scale. While in theory Elon could be ""margin called"" for his loans that have Tesla stock put up as collateral for, I am not so sure it would happen even if the stock drops significantly. The banks just went through a crisis of confidence with the whole Silicon Valley Bank collapse. If something triggered Elon's house of cards to collapse, it could have larger implications for his lenders and they might take a lot of heat for it. And the banks certainly don't want to invite in more oversight. They might just eat the loss and hold the shares in hopes they eventually regain their value. For that reason alone, I think the chances of Elon getting margin called are slim. But I would definitely be keeping an eye on the institutional holders once they report at the end of this month to see if there are any notable changes.

Edit/Update: A few hours after posting this, it was reported that [Swedish firm Folksam](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/sustainable-finance-reporting/swedish-insurer-folksam-divests-its-tesla-shareholding-2025-04-02/) closed their entire position in Tesla. While not nearly as big as other institutional holders, it was still about $160M worth of stock. That's not chump change. (Mods: Sorry for originally using a Seeking Alpha article in the link- I didn't know they were blacklisted). 

To end this manifesto post, and give the shorts a little glimmer of hope, I offer one possibility that has not really been talked about all that much. Despite the massive power of the ERDF, some people do indeed escape it. And despite all the hype around AI, robots, and automation, Elon's companies are still run by the most unpredictable machines on the planet- humans. Tesla's long time CFO and potential successor for Elon, Zachary Kirkhorn, left suddenly in the [summer of 2023](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-cfo-zachary-kirkhorn-steps-down-replaced-by-vaibhav-taneja-2023-08-07/). Four more of Elon's top executives and direct reports left in [short order in 2024](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-loses-4-top-executives-ahead-of-robotaxi-event-2024-10). Baglino sold off his [$180 million in shares](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/25/former-tesla-svp-drew-baglino-is-selling-181point5-million-worth-of-stock.html) when he left. Not much of a vote of confidence there. And Tesla as a whole recently [fired a massive number of employees](https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/tesla-started-laying-off-14000-employees-it-couldnt-have-gone-worse.html). From the reports, Elon seemingly did it in the same smug and indifferent manner in which he fired people at Twitter and is currently doing in the federal government.

Ultimately, if people become disenfranchised and are no longer willing to do Elon's bidding, his enterprises will fail. And there is only so much you can pay people to motivate them before you lose profitability. To make a Star Wars analogy, the only way I see to bring down the ERDF that protects and surrounds Elon's seemingly unstoppable Death Star, is if people on the inside of his operations lose faith in him and get tired of his bullshit. All the people around Elon: His loyal followers on X and even president Trump to some extent, don't do anything for him but build his ego and amplify the strength of the ERDF. But none of them know how to design and build cars or launch space shuttles. That's a very small group of very intelligent people that cannot be replaced as easily as retail investors. It's the smart people on the inside that make all of Elon's visions come into reality. In the end, I think the human element might be Elon's undoing.",222,123,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jpicww/tesla_hidey_hole_richmond_va_dont_believe_the/
2025-04-01 22:26:35,Alphabet,GOOGL,Bought NVDA at the wrong time? Not sure what to do next,"Hi everyone,

I know absolutely nothing about investing. My understanding is just: I buy stocks, they can go up or down, and I either make or lose money.

On January 6th, I bought 73 shares of NVIDIA. I had heard from friends that they made good money with it, so I thought I’d try it too.

I’m from Brazil, and I paid BRL 1,381.61. Now my investment is worth BRL 951.92 — that’s a loss of BRL 429.24.

Looking at the chart on Google, it seems like I got unlucky and bought right before it dropped.

My question is: should I just accept the loss and take my money out before it drops more? Or should I leave it there and hope for the best?

I honestly have no clue what might happen next, and to be honest, I’m not really interested in learning more about investing — I just want to make a reasonable decision here.

Thanks in advance!

EDIT: Based on the comments, I think it's important to clarify that I didn't have any specific goal with this investment — I just wanted to grow my money over the long term. I was aware of the risk of losing money, so I only invested an amount I was comfortable with potentially losing. From what I've read in the comments, it seems like holding onto these shares for the long term might actually be a good idea (Apparently even buying more haha).",0,93,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jp8s83/bought_nvda_at_the_wrong_time_not_sure_what_to_do/

Looking to get some feedback on where I’m keeping all my money. Feel free to remove if not allowed. Background - 27M, don’t own a home yet, no kids 

150K - 401K through work in index funds 
50K - Roth IRA brokerage account in index funds 
40K - VUSXX money market fund. way more than usual as I have some big life events coming up and didn’t want too much in stocks 25K - individual stocks which is split up into roughly 40% blue-chip stocks like MSFT/GOOGL, 40% solid growth stocks like AXON, SE, MELI and 20% more speculative picks like RKLB

This is the bulk of it. If the market continues to go down I plan on continuing to buy more individual stocks and will keep maxing out my Roth and contributing to 401K. Is this pretty typical for a portfolio? Mostly don’t want to be too much in individual stocks as I know it’s hard to beat the market over the long term. Thanks all!

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

> There are early signs that some European companies and governments are souring on their use of American cloud services provided by the three so-called hyperscalers. Between them, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) host vast swathes of the internet and keep thousands of businesses running. However, some organizations appear to be reconsidering their use of these companies’ cloud services—including servers, storage, and databases—citing uncertainties around privacy and data access fears under the Trump administration.

> “There’s a huge appetite in Europe to de-risk or decouple the over-dependence on US tech companies, because there is a concern that they could be weaponized against European interests,” says Marietje Schaake, a nonresident fellow at Stanford’s Cyber Policy Center and a former, decade-long member of the European Parliament.

> The moves may already be underway. On March 18, politicians in the Netherlands House of Representatives passed eight motions asking the government to reduce reliance on US tech companies and move to European alternatives. Days before, more than 100 organizations signed an open letter to European officials calling for the continent to become “more technologically independent” and saying the status quo creates “security and reliability risks.”

> Two European-based cloud service companies, Exoscale and Elastx, tell WIRED they have seen an uptick in potential customers looking to abandon US cloud providers over the last two weeks—with some already starting to make the jump. Multiple technology advisers say they are having widespread discussions about what it would take to uproot services, data, and systems.

> “We have more demand from across Europe,” says Mathias Nöbauer, the CEO of Swiss-based hosting provider Exoscale, adding there has been an increase in new customers seeking to move away from cloud giants. “Some customers were very explicit,” Nöbauer says. “Especially customers from Denmark being very explicit that they want to move away from US hyperscalers because of the US administration and what they said about Greenland.”

> “It's a big worry about the uncertainty around everything. And from the Europeans’ perspective—that the US is maybe not on the same team as us any longer,” says Joakim Öhman, the CEO of Swedish cloud provider Elastx. “Those are the drivers that bring people or organizations to look at alternatives.”

> Concerns have been raised about the current data-sharing agreement between the EU and US, which is designed to allow information to move between the two continents while protecting people’s rights. Multiple previous versions of the agreement have been struck down by European courts. At the end of January, Trump fired three Democrats from the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB), which helps manage the current agreement. The move could undermine or increase uncertainty around the agreement. In addition, Öhman says, he has heard concerns from firms about the CLOUD Act, which can allow US law enforcement to subpoena user data from tech companies, potentially including data that is stored in systems outside of the US.

> Dave Cottlehuber, the founder of SkunkWerks, a small tech infrastructure firm in Austria, says he has been moving the company’s few servers and databases away from US providers to European services since the start of the year. “First and foremost, it’s about values,” Cottlehuber says. “For me, privacy is a right not a privilege.” Cottlehuber says the decision to move is easier for a small business such as his, but he argues it removes some taxes that are paid to the Trump administration. “The best thing I can do is to remove that small contribution of mine, and also at the same time, make sure that my customers’ privacy is respected and preserved,” Cottlehuber says.

> Steffen Schmidt, the CEO of Medicusdata, a company that provides text-to-speech services to doctors and hospitals in Europe, says that having data in Europe has always “been a must,” but his customers have been asking for more in recent weeks. “Since the beginning of 2025, in addition to data residency guarantees, customers have actively asked us to use cloud providers that are natively European companies,” Schmidt says, adding that some of his services have been moved to Nöbauer’s Exoscale.

> Harry Staight, a spokesperson for AWS, says it is “not accurate” that customers are moving from AWS to EU alternatives. “Our customers have control over where they store their data and how it is encrypted, and we make the AWS Cloud sovereign-by-design,” Straight says. “AWS services support encryption with customer managed keys that are inaccessible to AWS, which means customers have complete control of who accesses their data.” Staight says the membership of the PCLOB “does not impact” the agreements around EU-US data sharing and that the CLOUD Act has “additional safeguards for cloud content.” Google and Microsoft declined to comment.

> The potential shift away from US tech firms is not just linked to cloud providers. Since January 15, visitors to the European Alternatives website increased more than 1,200 percent. The site lists everything from music streaming services to DDoS protection tools, says Marko Saric, a cofounder of European cloud analytics service Plausible. “We can certainly feel that something is going on,” Saric says, claiming that during the first 18 days of March the company has “beaten” the net recurring revenue growth it saw in January and February. “This is organic growth which cannot be explained by any seasonality or our activities,” he says.

> While there are signs of movement, the impact is likely to be small—at least for now. Around the world, governments and businesses use multiple cloud services—such as authentication measures, hosting, data storage, and increasingly data centers providing AI processing—from the big three cloud and tech service providers. Cottlehuber says that, for large businesses, it may take many months, if not longer, to consider what needs to be moved, the risks involved, plus actually changing systems. “What happens if you have a hundred petabytes of storage, it's going to take years to move over the internet,” he says.

> For years, European companies have struggled to compete with the likes of Google, Microsoft, and Amazon’s cloud services and technical infrastructure, which make billions every year. It may also be difficult to find similar services on the scale of those provided by alternative European cloud firms.

> “If you are deep into the hyperscaler cloud ecosystem, you’ll struggle to find equivalent services elsewhere,” says Bert Hubert, an entrepreneur and former government regulator, who says he has heard of multiple new cloud migrations to US firms being put on hold or reconsidered. Hubert has argued that it is no longer “safe” for European governments to be moved to US clouds and that European alternatives can’t properly compete. “We sell a lot of fine wood here in Europe. But not that much furniture,” he says. However, that too could change.

> Schaake, the former member of the European Parliament, says a combination of new investments, a different approach to buying public services, and a Europe-first approach or investing in a European technology stack could help to stimulate any wider moves on the continent. “The dramatic shift of the Trump administration is very tangible,” Schaake says. “The idea that anything could happen and that Europe should fend for itself is clear. Now we need to see the same kind of pace and leadership that we see with defense to actually turn this into meaningful action.”

I want to start by saying a huge thank you for all the kind words, thoughtful comments, insightful DMs, and support following my previous post. Honestly—holy shit—I didn’t expect that post to blow up the way it did.

As of the time I’m writing this, Part 1 has pulled in some pretty insane numbers:

* 774 upvotes
* 356 comments
* 817 shares

Those are absolutely bonkers, and I’m genuinely grateful for the encouragement and engagement. I’ve been a long-time lurker on this subreddit, learning quietly from many of you over the years. I never imagined that something I’d write would get this kind of traction. But some of the comments in that thread raised important questions and valid counterpoints—so I wanted to follow up with a deeper response.

Now, for those asking for charts, crayons, or simplified pictures—just a heads-up: this sub doesn’t support image uploads. So if you're looking for visual aids, you’ll need to do a bit of homework and look up the references and data I mention here. Trust me, it’s worth your time.

Also, there will be no TL;DR at the end of this post. If you’re someone who can’t—or won’t—read through a detailed explanation, then this probably isn’t for you. The economy, and the factors that influence how a stock moves, are complex. If you're not willing to engage with that complexity, you’re setting yourself up to get burned. So, with that said, let’s dive in.

This comment caught me by surprise because the numbers were totally made up. I have to go back and do some research because what he said wasn't true at all. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Tesla's net income was $2.31 billion on revenues of $25.7 billion. During this period, the company earned $692 million from selling automotive regulatory credits. This revenue from regulatory credits represents approximately 30% of Tesla's net income for the quarter.

[https://www.statista.com/statistics/1553187/revenue-of-tesla-regulatory-credits-by-quarter/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1553187/revenue-of-tesla-regulatory-credits-by-quarter/)

Tesla reported a 47% increase in 2024, totaling $1.57 billion for the year, up from $1.07 billion in 2023. While the exact figure for Q4 2024 isn't specified, if we assume the increase was evenly distributed, the quarterly interest income would be around $392.5 million. This would account for approximately 17% of the quarter's net income. Combining both regulatory credits and estimated interest income, these sources contributed approximately 47% of Tesla's net income in Q4 2024. The 70% is false information.

[https://www.captide.co/insights/tesla-q4-2024](https://www.captide.co/insights/tesla-q4-2024)

Now let's talk about sale of regulatory credits. These are *not actual cars sold*—they're a kind of *bonus revenue* Tesla earns because of how environmentally friendly its cars are. Governments around the world, especially in places like California and Europe, require automakers to sell a certain number of low-emission or zero-emission vehicles. If a car company doesn’t meet those requirements, they have to *buy credits* from companies that exceed the standard—like Tesla. Tesla earns a bunch of these credits because all its cars are electric. Then it sells them to other automakers who still rely on gas-powered cars. This is essentially free money for Tesla—it doesn’t cost them anything to generate these credits, but they can sell them for hundreds of millions of dollars.

As for interest income, this is money Tesla earns just for having cash in the bank or investments. Tesla holds billions in cash and short-term investments. Instead of letting it sit there, they invest it in safe, interest-earning instruments (like U.S. Treasury bonds or money market funds). This also include bitcoin. As interest rates rise, these earnings go up—so Tesla earns hundreds of millions per quarter just from letting their money sit and grow.

Remember what I said about bitcoin in the previous post? ""In December 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) updated its guidelines, allowing companies to report digital assets like Bitcoin at their fair market value. This change enabled Tesla to recognize unrealized gains on its Bitcoin holdings without selling them. Leveraging the new accounting standards, Tesla reported a $600 million increase in net income for the fourth quarter of 2024, attributed to the appreciation of its Bitcoin holdings. This gain represented approximately 26% of Tesla's net income for that quarter. [https://www.investopedia.com/why-a-new-rule-helped-tesla-get-usd600m-in-bitcoin-gains-but-may-cost-microstrategy-billions-8783060](https://www.investopedia.com/why-a-new-rule-helped-tesla-get-usd600m-in-bitcoin-gains-but-may-cost-microstrategy-billions-8783060) If you have been paying attention to the price of bitcoin since Q2024, it has dropped dramatically. The next earnings are going to be really bad.

As of March 22, 2025, Bitcoin's price is approximately $84,123.

On December 31, 2024, (Tesla Q4 2024 earning) Bitcoin's closing price was around $93,429. On December 31, 2024, Bitcoin's closing price was around $93,429.""

If this number hold true, Tesla interest income from bitcoin will drop by 9.96%.

With that said, the saying that Tesla doesn't make money from car isn't true. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Tesla's automotive sales revenue—which includes income from vehicle sales and related services—totaled approximately $18.8 billion. This figure represents about 73% of Tesla's total revenue of $25.7 billion for the same period. For the entire year of 2024, Tesla's automotive sales revenue amounted to $72.5 billion, accounting for approximately 74% of the total annual revenue of $97.7 billion. Remember the stuff about regulator credit above? These percentages indicate that automotive sales remain the primary contributor to Tesla's revenue, both quarterly and annually. Tesla is still a car company at heart, and this was it moat.

You might not know this about me, but I used to be a hardcore Tesla fanboy. I invested in the company back when they were just producing the original Roadster. Over the years, I’ve owned *every single product* Tesla has put out—including four of their vehicles.

Tesla’s sky-high valuation wasn’t just hype—it was because the company was doing things no one else dared to. It was more than just an automaker; it was positioned as a tech and AI company, with aspirations in robotics and full self-driving. But even beyond that, Tesla was pioneering a completely new model of vertical integration.

It wasn’t just about selling electric cars. Tesla popularized EVs, achieved massive adoption rates, and built an entire ecosystem around the vehicle. They sold their own insurance, handled their own repairs, created and *standardized* their own charging port (which others later adopted), and developed the most expansive EV charging network in the world.

Elon Musk wasn’t just building a car company—he was positioning Tesla to be the Rockefeller of the 21st-century automotive industry. Just like how Rockefeller controlled the oil pipeline from extraction to distribution, Tesla was aiming to control everything:

* Design and manufacturing of the vehicles
* Repair and servicing (only Tesla could repair a Tesla)
* Insurance and financing
* And the “gas stations” of the future—their Supercharger network

It was a brilliant playbook, and it echoed what made Sony so dominant in the 1990s: Sony owned the formats. Whether it was CDs, MiniDiscs, Blu-ray, or the Walkman headphone jack, Sony created the platforms and *collected royalties* when others used them.

Had Tesla stayed on that course—doubling down on ecosystem control and technological dominance—they truly had a shot at owning the entire EV industry. But somewhere along the way, they pivoted, and that vision started to drift.

I was a fanboy of Tesla, and I sold everything in November. I also started shorting Spy, but hopefully, I have time to talk about the economy in this post.

What truly broke the long-term vision for Tesla, in my eyes, was the company’s decision to step back from its charging station expansion—the very dream of becoming the next-generation energy empire, replacing Shell, Chevron, Mobil, and essentially every gas station in the world.

In late April 2024, Tesla made a dramatic internal shift by disbanding its entire Supercharger team, including its leader, Rebecca Tinucci. This wasn’t a small reorganization—it was a major strategic reversal. The move immediately sparked concern about the future of Tesla’s vast charging infrastructure, which had once been one of its most significant competitive advantages.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla\_Supercharger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Supercharger)

In response, Elon Musk stated that Tesla would still grow its Supercharger network—but at a much slower pace. The new focus would be on maintaining 100% uptime and expanding existing sites, rather than continuing the rapid rollout of new stations across the country and around the world. This change came as part of broader company-wide layoffs and a growing strategic pivot toward artificial intelligence and robotics.

[https://www.teslarati.com/elon-musk-explains-reasoning-behind-tesla-supercharger-team-disband/](https://www.teslarati.com/elon-musk-explains-reasoning-behind-tesla-supercharger-team-disband/)

For Tesla’s automotive partners—like Ford, GM, and Rivian, who had recently committed to adopting Tesla’s NACS charging standard—this sudden shift caused confusion and uncertainty. They had signed on with the expectation that Tesla would continue leading the way in EV infrastructure. Now, that future looked far less clear.

[https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/musk-disbands-tesla-ev-charging-team-leaving-customers-dark-2024-04-30/](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/musk-disbands-tesla-ev-charging-team-leaving-customers-dark-2024-04-30/)

As a Tesla owner in California, where EV adoption is highest, I’ve already started to see the consequences firsthand. Fewer new charging stations are being built, and the reliability of existing ones is noticeably declining. Increasingly, I encounter broken or malfunctioning Superchargers—something that used to be rare. In some locations, the charging speeds are significantly slower than they used to be—sometimes even half as fast.

On top of that, Tesla has introduced energy usage-based time rates, and the cost of charging has surged. What used to be a convenient and cost-effective option now feels like a premium-priced service. Three years ago, I used Superchargers without thinking twice. Today, I charge almost exclusively at home—because it’s five to eight times cheaper. Furthermore, you have to think about the high cost of housing and the majority of people renting or living in an apartment. They would have all had to use the Tesla charging stations for every EV car. Think about this implication!

**The bigger picture here is that Elon Musk had the chance to be a modern-day Rockefeller. He was on track to own the entire energy pipeline for electric vehicles: manufacturing the cars, selling the insurance, controlling the repairs, and operating the “gas stations” of the EV era through the Supercharger network.**

But that opportunity has slipped away. The dream of Tesla owning the entire EV ecosystem—end to end—has fractured. And it’s hard not to see this as a major strategic misstep.

u/Qc4281 ""I believe the Bulls are putting all of their hope in robotaxis and regardless of Q1, June will be the real test of how much support Tesla continues to have.""

It’s time to face a hard truth: Tesla is no longer on the cutting edge of robotaxi technology. As of 2025, the undisputed leader in autonomous ride-hailing is Waymo, a subsidiary of Alphabet (Google’s parent company).

Waymo operates at SAE Level 4 autonomy, meaning their vehicles can drive themselves without any human inside, in specific geofenced areas. This isn’t a prototype—it’s real, operational, and public.

Their Waymo One robotaxi service is live in Phoenix, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, where anyone can hail a fully driverless car—no safety driver, no steering wheel input, no human control required. Riders are using it every day like a regular Uber or Lyft.

In contrast, Tesla's so-called Full Self-Driving (FSD) is still classified as Level 2 autonomy. That means the system can assist with steering, acceleration, and braking, but the driver must be fully alert and ready to take over at all times. Tesla has no regulatory approval to operate a robotaxi fleet, and no Tesla on the road today can legally drive itself.

Waymo uses a sophisticated sensor fusion approach:

* Lidar for detailed 3D mapping
* Radar for object detection in poor visibility
* High-definition maps to understand complex city layouts

Tesla, by contrast, has removed radar and relies exclusively on cameras and neural networks, a vision-only system. While Tesla claims this mimics human driving, it’s also less reliable in poor lighting, bad weather, or unpredictable road scenarios. Waymo has logged over 20 million miles on public roads and released a detailed 2023 safety report showing zero major injuries or fatalities across millions of fully autonomous rides.

Elon Musk has been promising Level 4 or even Level 5 autonomy “next year” since 2016—nearly a decade of delays. As of today, FSD Beta still requires constant supervision. Tesla has not submitted its system to any regulatory body (e.g., DMV or NHTSA) for approval as an autonomous driving platform. No Tesla vehicle qualifies as a robotaxi, and none are legally allowed to operate as such

Tesla can't jump straight to Level 4. It first needs to prove Level 3, where the car can drive itself under limited conditions without driver input—but even that milestone has not been reached. It’s based more on hope and hype than actual technical progress or regulatory reality. Tesla has a powerful brand, and Elon’s ambitious promises get attention—but when it comes to real-world robotaxi deployment, Waymo is years ahead.

Now we can talk about the robot. Boston Dynamics and Tesla’s Optimus are both developing humanoid robots. Boston Dynamic Has been developing humanoid and quadruped robots for **over a decade**. Their humanoid robot, Atlas, can run, jump, do parkour, backflips, and handle complex terrain. Their quadruped robot, Spot, is already being used in real industrial environments—construction sites, factories, even police and research teams.

Tesla first unveiled Optimus in 2021as a concept, with actual development starting in 2022. Still in early prototype stages—Tesla has shown it walking, lifting objects, and folding clothes, but it’s not yet capable of dynamic movement like Atlas. As of 2025, it’s still being tested internally and isn’t commercially deployed.

Boston Dynamics is years ahead in terms of real-world functionality.

I think I’ve looked into this deeply enough to respond to the common claim that “Tesla is more than just a car company.” The truth is, Tesla *was* more than just a car company. It had a bold vision—revolutionizing energy, transportation, and robotics all at once.

But that vision has faded.

Today, Tesla has lost much of its momentum under Elon Musk’s shifting priorities. Right now, it's essentially an overvalued car company that’s trying to break into the robotaxi and robotics space—fields where it's already years, if not a decade, behind the actual industry leaders.

The ambition is still there—but the execution no longer matches the hype.

Now, this isn't to say that Tesla will be going down in the next months or two. I noticed many of the people who are reading the previous post didn't understand what I was talking about when I was talking about LPSY. Specifically, I was referring to the Wyckoff distribution schematic phase c-d LPSY. Phase C is the test. The ‘Test’ serves the same but opposite function as the ‘Spring’ in the accumulation phase: the bull trap before the downtrend. While this level does get broken, it doesn’t change the picture of the cycle. Phase D is the effect. Phase D in this distribution phase is a mirror image of Phase D in the accumulation cycle. There is a considerable surge in volume and volatility, comprising one or more Last Point of Supply (LPSY) points. A Sign of Weakness (SOW) level happens, the final indication that the bears will soon take center stage. You have to open up tradingview or similar program to draw this, but it looks like Tesla is currently in that phase.

[https://www.tradersmastermind.com/wyckoff-method/](https://www.tradersmastermind.com/wyckoff-method/)

The LPSY (Last Point of Supply) is a critical stage in the Wyckoff distribution schematic where rallies begin to fail, unable to reach previous highs. During this phase, we typically expect to see a short-term rally, but it’s often weak and unsustainable. Volume behavior becomes a major red flag—buying volume dries up on the way up, while selling volume increases during pullbacks. This pattern suggests that institutions have already completed their distribution, leaving retail traders to buy the dip, unaware that the “smart money” has exited. As a result, the stock becomes highly vulnerable to a sharp decline.

In Tesla’s case, these signs are already becoming visible. We’re seeing a pattern of lower highs, indicating that each rebound is losing strength. Key support levels are eroding, and momentum is fading, even in response to what would typically be considered “good news.” At the same time, narrative fatigue is setting in—delays in the robotaxi rollout, slowing delivery growth, ongoing price cuts, and Tesla’s recent pullback from expanding its Supercharger network have all contributed to weakening sentiment. All of this points to Tesla potentially being in its LPSY phase, teetering on the edge of a deeper markdown.

One thing we often overlook when talking about Tesla is its status as a luxury brand, which brings us back to the broader conversation about the economy. Before I go any further, I want to be clear: I’m praying that I’m wrong. I don’t *want* the economy to crash. But I’ve lived through a recession before—and I remember it vividly.

Back in 2008, I watched family and friends lose their businesses, homes, jobs, savings—and in some cases, even loved ones. The pain was real. And what made it worse was knowing that much of it happened while our government and institutions downplayed the risks or outright lied to the public. That experience has shaped the way I look at economic data today.

Right now, I believe we're entering a recession—or at the very least, staring down a serious economic slowdown. I'm not writing this to tell you to sell all your stocks or panic. I’m sharing this because I hope you’ll take a step back, assess your risks, and plan accordingly.

According to the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), a recession is defined as a significant decline in economic activity that is widespread and lasts for more than a few months. It typically shows up in multiple indicators: GDP, personal income, employment, industrial production, and retail sales. There's also a more technical (but less comprehensive) definition: two consecutive quarters of negative real GDP growth.

During the 2008 financial crisis, the earliest warning signs appeared in November 2007, which the NBER later marked as the official start of the recession. At that time, major financial institutions began reporting huge losses on mortgage-backed securities, job growth slowed, consumer confidence dropped, and the stock market—which had peaked in October 2007—began to decline. Subprime lenders were collapsing, and credit was tightening across the board.

By mid-2008, the crisis accelerated: Bear Stearns collapsed in March, and Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in September. Housing prices plummeted, unemployment surged, and the economy spiraled. If you had exited the market in November 2007, you would not have seen the S&P 500 return to the same level until May 2011. That’s 3.5 years of waiting—and that's assuming you had the ability to hold through it all. This matters because knowing when to cut losses can save years of financial recovery, unless you're okay with sitting on those losses for the long haul.

I still remember watching Alan Greenspan, then Chairman of the Federal Reserve, downplay the risks in the housing market and broader economy. Despite clear signs of overheating in credit and housing, he failed to act—ignoring warnings from economists, regulators, and data. That experience is why I don’t place my faith in Jerome Powell or any official narrative. I trust only the numbers.

Looking ahead, the week of March 24–30 will give us key economic data. On Wednesday, we’ll get the Durable Goods Orders report. The forecast is -0.7%, compared to last month’s +3.1%. If it comes in even lower, that’s significant—because durable goods (like cars, appliances, aircraft, and machinery) are only purchased when businesses and consumers feel confident. A steep drop in this number is a classic early warning sign of a recession. However, durable goods alone don’t tell the full story—it needs to be paired with rising unemployment, falling retail sales, and declining industrial production to form a full recessionary picture.

On Thursday, we’ll see the GDP growth rate (QoQ). It was 3.0% in September and 3.1% in December. The projection now is 2.3%. If it misses expectations and drops even lower, we may not officially “ring the recession bell” just yet—but June’s data will become pivotal. That's when things may start to shift into ""oh-shit"" mode.

Then on Friday, we’ll get personal income and personal spending figures. These are crucial. If both decline, that’s another strong recession signal. Personal spending accounts for nearly 70% of U.S. GDP, and if consumers stop spending, the economy slows—simple as that. Personal income tells us how much financial cushion people have. When both metrics go down, it shows growing financial stress among households.

For the week of March 31–April 6, we’ll get more insight with ISM Services PMI on Thursday, and then non-farm payrolls and the unemployment rate on Friday. Forecasts haven’t been released yet, but if these numbers also disappoint—especially in combination with all the metrics above—we’ll be staring at a textbook recession setup. These are the early signs, and I’m laying them out not to scare you, but to prepare you.

You may think I’m being overly cautious, and I could absolutely be wrong. And honestly—I hope I am. But the question you have to ask yourself is: Are you willing to risk losing 50% of your savings just to see if I’m wrong?

Looking back at 2008, throughout most of 2007 and early 2008, the Bush administration repeatedly said the economy was “fundamentally sound,” even as the housing and credit markets collapsed beneath them. In January 2008, President Bush acknowledged “economic challenges” but still refused to call it a recession. And by the time the government acted decisively, it was already too late for millions of families.

This isn’t about being Republican or Democrat. It’s about making sure the words our officials say line up with what the numbers are telling us. If they don’t—we need to learn from history and not fall into the same trap. We can’t afford to get scammed into losing our life savings again.

Let’s circle back to the topic of Tesla as a luxury brand—because that’s an important lens to view its current position through. Do you remember what happened during the 2008 financial crisis? Both automobile sales and luxury goods took a massive hit. Consumers cut back sharply on big-ticket purchases, and the luxury sector—cars, fashion, jewelry, travel—was no exception.

If you haven’t already, take a look at LVMH, the world’s largest luxury conglomerate. Its stock has dropped significantly, reflecting weakening demand for high-end consumer goods. This is a telling sign. Now ask yourself—what about Airbnb (ABNB)? Another brand that, while not traditionally “luxury,” thrives on discretionary income and consumer confidence. It’s also seeing a decline, which suggests people are pulling back on travel and experiences—another luxury-like behavior.

Then there’s the VIX, the so-called “fear index” that tracks market volatility. If you examine the chart, you’ll notice that it’s starting to resemble the early stages of 2008—with rising spikes and volatility building quietly under the surface.

Some may argue that it also looks like 2020, when COVID-19 triggered a global economic shutdown. But the key difference is that in 2020, the whole world was impacted simultaneously—the pandemic was a shared crisis that brought coordinated government responses, massive stimulus, and a V-shaped recovery.

This time is different. What we’re seeing now is primarily an American problem—rooted in sticky inflation, rising consumer debt, eroding household savings, and waning confidence in domestic institutions and policy. Other countries aren't yet showing the same systemic stress.

So when we talk about Tesla, or any luxury-adjacent brand, we have to recognize that luxury spending is one of the first things to be cut when consumers feel insecure. And the signs—from LVMH to ABNB to the VIX—are stacking up. This isn’t fear-mongering. It’s pattern recognition.

Lastly—and I want to emphasize this—I'm not saying the sky is falling, nor am I predicting that the stock market is going to crash tomorrow. In fact, I actually believe the market may move upward in the short term due to momentum, technicals, or temporary optimism.

However, looking beyond the next few weeks, I believe the economic data over the next six months will begin to confirm what many of us already feel: that a recession is likely on the horizon. In particular, I think the next three months will be the most revealing. The trends we see in that window—whether in job growth, consumer spending, durable goods, or inflation—will be the “tell” that it's time for investors to start protecting their assets and reassessing their positions.

You don't need to sell everything. But you do need to have a plan. Because once the data becomes undeniable, the window to exit cleanly and safely may close fast.

Thank you for taking the time to read my posts. I had planned to dive into other topics, but honestly, there’s so much unfolding right now that it’s hard to keep it all focused. I genuinely feel for those who are still holding on, caught in the sunken cost fallacy, hoping things will bounce back simply because they’ve already lost so much.

Just remember: losing less is always better than losing more. Sometimes survival in the market isn’t about timing the top or the bottom—it’s about knowing when to step aside and preserve what you have.

As always, I welcome your thoughts, counterpoints, or insights. Let’s navigate this together.",791,290,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jijwnb/tesla_short_thesis_and_the_us_market_house_of/

I have to pay many different fees and more taxes on stocks like (Foreign exchange fees, broker fees, high taxes and even higher on dividends + unfriendly stock and investing country laws.) and it's very frustrating, especially if I want to buy US based stocks with dollars.

In my country there's no such thing as long term or short term capital gains tax. You pay 27% tax on around $9000 profits per year and 42% on above that which is ridiculous. 

If the average person wants to build large amount of wealth safely and retire comfortably, investing in the US stock market is a great option and It's been more accessible to us Europeans recently and I'm very grateful for that.

Stocks arguably have been more known to the average American and accessible to them than elsewhere in the world, why? 

Why is the US🇺🇲 so much more friendly and encouraging on trading and investing in stocks? Way more brokerage options with less fees, less taxation, great retirement- programs and laws on stocks and (401k, Roth IRA, long term capital gains tax = less taxes) no foreign exchange fees since the largest traded stocks are US based companies in the largest stock exchanges that use $ dollars.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2025-03-21 00:54:15,Alphabet,GOOGL,Short sellers have made $15 billion betting against Tesla and Nvidia in 2025,"Short sellers have been cleaning up to start 2025 amid a massive sell-off in some of the market's most popular names over the past two years.

Short sellers have made a combined $15 billion betting against Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) stock thus far this year, according to data from S3 Partners. Tesla shorts alone have raked in nearly $11 billion, while bets against Nvidia have brought in more than $4 billion.

Tesla's 40% year-to-date drop has led the declines of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks. Investors have grown concerned about CEO Elon Musk's focus on government efficiency efforts and how his role with President Trump's administration could be a turnoff to the electric vehicle maker's customer base.

But it hasn't just been Tesla lagging. As an index, the Magnificent Seven — which also includes Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) — is underperforming the S&P 500 this quarter by the most since 2022.

Short sellers have profited off of all of the names in the cohort this year. They've brought in nearly $5 billion betting against Apple stock, which is down nearly 14% in 2025.

The crash in the most popular trade of the past two years comes as investors have been re-rating their growth expectations. Fears of slowing economic growth and the impact of Trump's tariff policies have weighed on markets. Meanwhile, Big Tech has faced growing investor criticism about its ballooning AI spend and whether or not it will eventually boost future profits as much as Wall Street hopes. The year also included a massive drawdown in some large tech names, including Nvidia, following the release of a cheaper AI model from Chinese company DeepSeek.

Now, with most of the names sitting around 20% off their recent 52-week highs, the looming question for markets is whether or not investor appetite for the stocks that led the market higher for the past two years will return.

""Maybe these tech stocks got ahead of their skis a little bit,"" BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski told Yahoo Finance last week. ""But at the end of the day, these are monster companies that define the growth trajectory for the United States stock market. They are not going away.""

2025-03-20 19:42:50,Alphabet,GOOGL,DOJ wants Alphabet to sell Chrome. Why?,"This seems like it has been discussed for a few years now, but a recent relevant article is here: https://www.techspot.com/news/107215-justice-department-asks-dc-judge-order-immediate-sale.html

From what I understand, Google's Chrome browser is based off of Chromium, an open-sourced browser project. Microsoft's Edge browser and Opera's web browser are also based on Chromium.

How can Google be forced to ""sell"" something that is already available for anyone to use?

Yes, Google employees seem to be the ones who maintain the Chromium codebase, but why would anyone want to *pay* Google money just to take on the burden of having to maintain code that any other company can still benefit from?

And beyond that, even if Google sells their ""Chrome"" browser, can't they just *immediately* start building another ""Totally-Not-Chrome"" web browser that is also based off of Chromium?

I think I'm failing to see what the core legal problem here is. Chrome is just a web browser. Yes, it is bundled with Android devices, but users can still download any other browser and use that instead. Just like how plenty of Windows users used to immediately download Chrome, or Apple and Linux users used to immediately download Opera.

And now to the reason I'm even posting in this subreddit: **What effect, if any, would this have on Alphabet's stock price?**

If they can still sell it and immediately turn around and just build another web browser... Doesn't that effectively mean free money into Alphabet's pocket from whoever makes the purchase?

I swear I'm not trying to be dense here. I'm clearly missing something, right? Any assistance/clarification would be appreciated.",215,148,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jfxmhs/doj_wants_alphabet_to_sell_chrome_why/

I'm not putting down Apple's products - the iPhone did change the world, and Siri ...... well, at least the way we interact with our phones. But today, we're talking about stocks, and AAPL is looking more and more like a “shareholder-funded AI experiment”.



Apple's growth is slowing, iPhone sales are weak, and the company's attempts to boost demand with AI features like Apple Intelligence have frequently skipped a beat, with Siri's AI upgrade pushed back to 2026 or possibly even later, and iOS 18's bugs making the user experience even worse. Meanwhile, rivals like Google and Amazon have made significant strides in the AI assistant space.



To make matters worse, Apple's valuation is already ridiculously high, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 29x, well above the S&P 500's 20x. That's clearly unsustainable given its single-digit growth expectations. The irony is that Cook seems to be focusing more on growth in the services business, while innovation in the iPhone as a core product has been weak. So why exactly is this company still worth so much money? How do you see Apple's future? Is it time to reassess its valuation?

2025-03-18 18:40:23,Alphabet,GOOGL,Nvidia announces Blackwell Ultra and Vera Rubin AI chips,"Nvidia announced new chips for building and deploying artificial intelligence models at its annual GTC conference on Tuesday. 

CEO Jensen Huang revealed Blackwell Ultra, a family of chips shipping in the second half of this year, as well as Vera Rubin, the company’s next-generation graphics processing unit, or GPU, that is expected to ship in 2026.

Nvidia’s sales are up more than sixfold since its business was transformed by the release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in late 2022. That’s because its “big GPUs” have most of the market for developing advanced AI, a process called training.

Software developers and investors are closely watching the company’s new chips to see if they offer enough additional performance and efficiency to convince the company’s biggest end customers — cloud companies including Microsoft, Google and Amazon — to continue spending billions of dollars to build data centers based around Nvidia chips.

Tuesday’s announcements are also a test of Nvidia’s new annual release cadence. The company is striving to announce new chips on an every-year basis. Before the AI boom, Nvidia released new chips every other year. 

The GTC conference in San Jose, California, is also a show of strength for Nvidia. 

The event, Nvidia’s second in-person conference since the pandemic, is expected to have 25,000 attendees and hundreds of companies discussing the ways they use the company’s hardware for AI. That includes Waymo, Microsoft and Ford, among others. 

Nvidia will also showcase its other products and services at the event. 

For example, Nvidia announced new laptops and desktops using its chips, including two AI-focused PCs that will be able to run large AI models such as Llama or DeepSeek. The company also announced updates to its networking parts for tying hundreds or thousands of GPUs together so they work as one.

Vera Rubin

Nvidia said on Tuesday that it expects to start shipping systems on its next-generation GPU family in the second half of 2026. 

The system has two main components: a CPU, called Vera, and a new GPU design, called Rubin. It’s named after astronomer Vera Rubin.

Vera is Nvidia’s first custom CPU design, the company said, and it’s based on a core design they’ve named Olympus. 

Previously when it needed CPUs, Nvidia used an off-the-shelf design from Arm. Companies that have developed custom Arm core designs, such as Qualcomm and Apple, say that they can be more tailored and unlock better performance.

The custom Vera design will be twice as fast as the CPU used in last year’s Grace Blackwell chips, the company said. 

When paired with Vera, Rubin can manage 50 petaflops while doing inference, more than double the 20 petaflops for the company’s current Blackwell chips. Rubin can also support as much as 288 gigabytes of fast memory, which is one of the core specs that AI developers watch.

Nvidia is also making a change to what it calls a GPU. Rubin is actually two GPUs, Nvidia said. 

The Blackwell GPU, which is currently on the market, is actually two separate chips that were assembled together and made to work as one chip.

Starting with Rubin, Nvidia will say that when it combines two or more dies to make a single chip, it will refer to them as separate GPUs. In the second half of 2027, Nvidia plans to release a “Rubin Next” chip that combines four dies to make a single chip, doubling the speed of Rubin, and it will refer to that as four GPUs.

Nvidia said that will come in a rack called Vera Rubin NVL144. Previous versions of Nvidia’s rack were called NVL72.

Blackwell Ultra

Nvidia also announced new versions of its Blackwell family of chips that it calls Blackwell Ultra.

That chip will be able to produce more tokens per second, which means that the chip can generate more content in the same amount of time as its predecessor, Nvidia said in a briefing.

Nvidia says that means that cloud providers can use Blackwell Ultra to offer a premium AI service for time-sensitive applications, allowing them to make as much as 50 times the revenue from the new chips as the Hopper generation, which shipped in 2023.

Blackwell Ultra will come in a version with two paired to an Nvidia Arm CPU, called GB300, and a version with just the GPU, called B300. It will also come in versions with eight GPUs in a single server blade and a rack version with 72 Blackwell chips.

The top four cloud companies have deployed three times the number of Blackwell chips as Hopper chips, Nvidia said.

DeepSeek

China’s DeepSeek R1 model may have scared Nvidia investors when it was released in January, but Nvidia has embraced the software. The chipmaker will use the model to benchmark several of its new products.

Many AI observers said that DeepSeek’s model, which reportedly required fewer chips than models made in the U.S., threatened Nvidia’s business.

But Huang said earlier this year that DeepSeek was actually a good sign for Nvidia. That’s because DeepSeek uses a process called “reasoning,” which requires more computing power to provide users better answers. 

The new Blackwell Ultra and Vera Rubin chips are better for reasoning models, Nvidia said. 

It’s developed its chips to more efficiently do inference, so when new reasoning models require more computing power at the time of deployment, Nvidia’s chips will be able to handle it.

“In the last 2-3 years, a major breakthrough happened, a fundamental advance in artificial intelligence happened, we call it agentic AI,” Huang said. “It can reason about how to answer or how to solve a problem.”

2025-03-18 14:35:08,Alphabet,GOOGL,Google to acquire cloud security startup Wiz for $32 billion,"Google on Tuesday signed a “definitive agreement” to acquire Wiz, the New York-based cloud security startup, for $32 billion in an all-cash deal, according to releases.

The deal, which will be Google’s largest-ever acquisition, will improve its cloud security offering in a world of advancing artificial intelligence and cybersecurity threats. Wiz will become a part of the company’s cloud business. Google said it expects to close the deal in 2026.

“Google Cloud is a leader in cloud infrastructure, with deep AI expertise and a track record of industry-leading security innovation,” Google said in a release. “Bringing all this to Wiz will help make their solutions even better and more scalable, benefiting customers and partners across all major clouds.”

The acquisition comes after CNBC reported in July that Wiz had walked away from a potential $23 billion acquisition by Google and announced to employees that it would pursue an initial public offering instead.

“Saying no to such humbling offers is tough,” Wiz co-founder Assaf Rappaport wrote to employees in a July memo obtained by CNBC. At the time, a source familiar with the matter told CNBC that Wiz walked away from the deal in part due to antitrust and investor concerns.

Before talks with Google were reported, Wiz had set its sights on two goals: an IPO and $1 billion in annual recurring revenue. In the memo at the time, Rappaport wrote that the company would pursue those milestones.

Wiz was founded in 2020 and has grown rapidly under Rappaport, with the company hitting $100 million in annual recurring revenue after just 18 months. The company’s cloud security products include prevention, active detection and response, a portfolio that’s appealed to large firms and would have helped Google compete with Microsoft, which also sells security software.

“Becoming part of Google Cloud is effectively strapping a rocket to our backs: it will accelerate our rate of innovation faster than what we could achieve as a standalone company,” Rappaport said in a blog post Tuesday.

Google has a long history in dealmaking and snatching up smaller companies to broaden its offerings to customers. Its largest deal before Wiz was the $12.5 billion acquisition of hardware marker Motorola in 2012. Two years later, the company sold some assets to Lenovo for $2.9 billion. Google has also made cybersecurity acquisitions in the past, paying $5.4 billion for Mandiant in 2022.

Wiz’s products will still work on competitor platforms including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud, the companies said. The Wall Street Journal first reported Monday that the companies were in advanced discussions.

While the agreement may still draw government scrutiny, many on Wall Street have been hopeful that President Donald Trump’s new White House administration will be more amenable to tech industry deals. Alphabet is currently battling an antitrust suit over its online search dominance.

> Alphabet Inc. is in talks to purchase the cloud security company Wiz for $33 billion, restarting deal discussions that were called off last summer after extended negotiations, according to people familiar with the matter. 

> The deal, which could be announced as soon as Tuesday, would bolster the cybersecurity offerings for Alphabet’s Google Cloud and provide it with a crucial marketing boost to compete against its larger cloud competitors, Amazon.com Inc.’s Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Corp.’s Azure.

> For Wiz, the deal represents a reversal after the company turned down Alphabet’s $23 billion offer last July, sticking instead with a plan to remain independent and eventually pursue an initial public offering. Wiz and its investors balked at the deal in part because of worries of a protracted regulatory approval process, with competition authorities in the US and Europe focusing on the tech sector for its economic sway and market power. 

> Chief Executive Officer Assaf Rappaport, who described last year’s offer as “humbling,” also said he relished the idea of growing Wiz into an independent cybersecurity giant, to compete against the likes of CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. and Palo Alto Networks.

> Started by Israelis and based in New York, Wiz’s investors include Sequoia Capital, Index Ventures, Insight Partners and Cyberstarts.

2025-03-15 17:58:22,Alphabet,GOOGL,Why $RDDT Is A Must Have Stock,"Reddit is one of the premier social media apps out there with a cheap valuation (never judge a growth stock by P/E) for its growth trajectory.

Let's start with the fundamentals:

1. 2024 YE it had a 90.5% gross profit percentage, revenue grew by 62% (NVIDIA like growth??) and it became FCF positive. Next quarter revenue will be growing at 50% to ultimately end at 40% YoY based on guidance. I've been following $RDDT for quite some time and there is always a beat on revenue AND guidance versus what they expected so you can say there is a little bit of conservatism in this numbers.
2. From a balance sheet perspective it only has $26.7mm of debt. This company generated $215mm in FCF this year and is forecast to double to $520mm by next year. Capex spend is only 2% of its revenue. This companies management loves to run things efficiently and as cheaply as possible. On going concern is not an issue.
3. The company is already EPS positive and will turn EPS positive on a YoY basis by 2025 YE. If you look at it from a PEG perspective, it is trading at 0.74 for 2026. Anything below 1 is cheap. The only reason you see negative EPS is because the company has been expensing stock based compensation (US GAAP) requirement each quarter. This has ended in 2024, that is why you see major acceleration in EPS growth QoQ moving forward.
4. Share dilution is very minimal. A lot of growth companies like to pay employees in stock to attract talent, but that is not what reddit does. Diluated shares outstanding actually fell 1% in QoQ. This is great for any share holder.
5. Reddit data is a gold mine. Google pays Reddit $66mm a year for data licensing. This has 85% operating margin - so you need to remember Reddits profitability isn't going away anytime soon because you are starting from a high point.
6. Insider trading has popped up this weekend after the crazy drop. That is a significant buy signal.
7. From a multiple standpoint, price to sales, revenue etc it has gotten cheaper despite the stock increasing in value. Reddit user growth has exploded over time, with 50% international base and is becoming a hit globally. Reddit's top 15 advertisers spent 50% more YoY and international ad revenue grew by 77%.

\- THIS IS IMPORTANT. If US were to go slow down, the international piece provides a buffer on revenue for the company.

8) Advertising approach is incredibly unique. Reddit offers companies the ability to have AMAs to offer product information. I've personally seen this in my time using this reddit. Each subreddit is highly specialized which makes advertising that much easier. People pay Meta and Google top dollar because they are able to use statistical AI inference to generate ad campaigns well. Reddit doesn't need that. If you sell bikes, there's a laundry list of bike subreddits you can target. This is the future as Ad targeting improves on Reddit.

Downside / Bear bases:

1. Highly dependent on Google search. Google search was the reason that Reddit fell after earnings because of the average daily user count fell. Management has said this happens often in its existence and they worked quickly to get back on top of user searches. Management was largely dismissive of this because of their experience and noted higher levels of people asking questions and typing reddit at the end into google.
2. AI Capex slows down. This will erode profitability on the company, but given how ""clean"" reddit data is, this is the least of my concerns.
3. Execution and ad platform growth. Growing is expensive, and if Reddit adopts a spend what you can to get it done it will have investors fearful. Based on their CFO's commentary this is not very likely because how they approach things and history shows.
4. User growth slows down. This is highly possible, but I do believe the international side of things will be a buffer on user growth.

Having said all of this, my PT is $250 for the company. This is an absolute long term hold.

Any dips should be bought and even though Reddit looks expensive at face value, it really isn't. It trades at 50x forward earnings with 50% YoY growth and a net profitability that will approach 30+%.

2025-03-15 14:40:09,Alphabet,GOOGL,$TTD - A Buying Opportunity in its Plummeting Stock,"Trade Desk ($TTD) is down over 50% in literally a month, marking its largest decline in history after missing earnings for the first time. The stock sold off hard, but the fundamentals haven’t changed nearly as much as the price suggests. Analysts still have a median price target of ~$120, implying significant upside from here. I’m planning on buying LEAPS to take advantage of what looks like an overreaction.

Pros:

✅ Strong revenue growth – Still growing 23% YoY, despite ad spending softness
✅ High margins – 84% gross margins, which is best-in-class for ad tech
✅ Solid balance sheet – $1.5B in cash and no debt, giving them flexibility
✅ CTV dominance – Continued leadership in connected TV (CTV) advertising

Cons:

❌ Near-term ad spend weakness – Advertisers are cutting budgets in a tough macro environment
❌ Competitive pressures – Google and Amazon are pushing harder into programmatic advertising
❌ High valuation (even after the drop) – Still trades at 15-16x forward sales, though historically it’s commanded a premium

The long-term growth story for TTD remains intact, even if Q1 guidance disappointed. The market has punished it heavily, but historically, high-quality growth stocks tend to bounce back once macro pressures ease.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2025-03-13 00:06:31,Alphabet,GOOGL,Trump’s FTC Moves Ahead With Broad Microsoft Antitrust Probe,">The US Federal Trade Commission is moving ahead with a sprawling antitrust probe of Microsoft Corp. that was opened in the waning days of the Biden Administration, signaling that Donald Trump’s new FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson is going to prioritize scrutiny of tech giants.

>FTC staff in recent weeks have continued to work on the investigation, meeting with companies and other groups to gather information, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named discussing a confidential investigation.

>The FTC sent Microsoft a so-called civil investigative demand, which is similar to a subpoena, late last year. The document, a copy of which was viewed by Bloomberg, compels the company to turn over reams of data about its AI operations, including the cost to train models and obtain data, going as far back as 2016. The agency sought details about Microsoft’s data centers, its struggles to find enough computing power to meet customer demand and the company’s software licensing practices.

>The FTC is also scrutinizing Microsoft’s decision to slash funding on its own artificial intelligence projects after striking a deal with OpenAI, which could be perceived as hurting competition in the burgeoning AI market.

>One company has heard regularly from the FTC on the issue of Microsoft’s licensing practices since the investigative demand was sent, said one of the people. The FTC and lawyers for that company have discussed what information the agency could ask for in a more comprehensive, formal request. The company also received a shorter list of questions several weeks ago asking for documents the company provided to other regulators. The FTC is further seeking information about licensing rule changes Microsoft said will go into effect later this year, the person said.

>The agency said in the information demand that it wants to determine whether Microsoft’s profits from other parts of the business give it an edge over other AI companies. The agency also said it wants details about Microsoft’s data center capacity constraints to better understand the costs behind cloud-computing services. Those details will help the agency determine whether to bring a case.

>Since receiving the FTC demand, Microsoft may have sought to narrow the scope of the information it’s being asked to turn over — a typical move by companies being probed by the agency. Such wide-ranging antitrust investigations can take years and don’t always result in the agency bringing a case.

>“We are working cooperatively with the agency,” said Alex Haurek, a Microsoft spokesman. The FTC didn’t respond to a request for comment.

>The evolution of the probe now rests in the hands of Ferguson and his new head of competition, Daniel Guarnera, who joined the agency from the Justice Department, where he worked on antitrust cases targeting Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Apple Inc.

>In his first public remarks since taking the chair position in late February, Ferguson said investigating the tech sector is his highest priority. Early moves include seeking information on censorship by tech companies.

>Ferguson also backed a filing in January in support of billionaire Elon Musk, who sued to derail OpenAI’s plans to restructure as a more conventional for-profit business.

>The civil investigative demand was crafted by FTC staff and personally signed off on by former Chair Lina Khan after the agency spent more than a year conducting informal interviews with Microsoft competitors and business partners, Bloomberg previously reported.

>Ferguson’s FTC has inherited several other cases against big tech companies from Khan, including lawsuits against Meta Platforms Inc. and [Amazon](http://Amazon.com) Inc. On Wednesday, the agency asked a judge to delay a trial challenging Amazon’s Prime subscription practices, citing resource constraints at the agency. The FTC quickly walked back comments that resource constraints at the agency will hamper its ability to start a trial in September.

>Most of the questions in the information demand relate to how Microsoft licenses its software products, particularly as it relates to the company’s cloud-computing business. Competitors have complained that Microsoft’s licensing terms and bundling of both its popular office productivity and security software with its cloud offerings makes it harder for them to compete.

>About a third of the questions focus on Microsoft’s AI business, highlighting the importance of the burgeoning technology to the company’s future. Underlying the FTC’s requests are concerns that Microsoft canceled some of its own work after deciding to invest in deciding to invest in OpenAI and learning heavily on its GPT software, eliminating potential competition.

>Despite the hefty sum, Microsoft didn’t disclose its investment to competition regulators ahead of time, and the FTC also has been investigating whether the deal was structured as a partnership to avoid a merger investigation, Bloomberg has reported.

>When Microsoft first invested in OpenAI in 2019, the startup was a promising research lab looking for a way to fund the cloud-computing power required to create AI models. Microsoft started with a $1 billion infusion after co-founder Musk withdrew his backing. Microsoft had been working on various AI projects of its own for more than two decades and feared it was falling behind rival Google.

>The company’s efforts were scattered across several divisions and not producing the results Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella had hoped for. In 2023, one month after pumping an additional $10 billion into OpenAI, Microsoft began unveiling a series of products infused with OpenAI technology. Microsoft pulled back on its internal effort to develop the technology, which raised a red flag for the FTC is going to prioritize scrutiny of tech giants.

>FTC staff in recent weeks have continued to work on the investigation, meeting with companies and other groups to gather information, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named discussing a confidential investigation.

Using robotics-focused AI models developed by the likes of Google and OpenAI can help cash-strapped startups reduce development costs and increase the speed at which they can take their product to market.

Google said it tested the Gemini Robotics model on data from its bi-arm robotics platform, ALOHA 2, but can be specialized for complex use cases such as Apptronik's Apollo robot.

Google's launch comes a month after robotics startup Figure AI [exited](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/robotics-startup-figure-ai-talks-new-funding-395-billion-valuation-bloomberg-2025-02-14/) its collaboration agreement with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI after it made an internal breakthrough in AI for robots.

What are Google investors thinking of this strategic decision?

TSM has proposed a joint venture to Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom to operate Intel's foundry division, with TSM managing the operations but holding less than a 50% stake. We saw INTC make a decent bounce in the overnight yesterday on that news, but it looks like we're giving back most of those gains. This move comes as Intel faces significant losses in its manufacturing division, the CHIPS Act is targeted by Trump, so frankly a very good positive catalyst but I don't expect much to come of this. The possibility of a joint venture between these 4 companies actually happening seems fantastical, especially with Trump stating that he wants to scrap the CHIPS Act and instead work on tariffs on semis.

Loop Capital has maintained a buy rating on Reddit Inc. (RDDT), citing strong core fundamentals and a 71% year-over-year sales growth. I don't normally pay attention to these buy/sell ratings but I did notice this was during one of the worst selloffs for RDDT and the market downturn, so it was *a little* more significant than normal.  The company's stock has experienced a nearly 50% decline from recent highs within the past month. I thought this was interesting yesterday near the open so I bought some stock, overall still holding but interested to see where it goes after the open. Also worth noting, Reddit's plans to monetize its subscriber base are expected to boost revenue (I see them competing with Patreon/Substack/Onlyfans). This is overall a pretty positive catalyst, not much risk to it beyond additional negative news coming in for the broader tech sector.

Google has unveiled Gemma 3, a new AI model designed for developers to create applications capable of running efficiently on various devices, including those powered by Nvidia GPUs. I'm also long NVDA a little more- GOOG hasn't pulled back as much as I expected compared to NVDA, but this is pointedly good news. We're also seeing a minor market bounce but whether that can hold is up in the air. Going to sell out if we break new lows in the market. Another model in the arms race that can be run on a SINGLE device is massive news, especially considering the model's competitiveness with Deepseek R1. This is overall positive news but there's always the chance that Deepseek releases an even better model in the future even though the $13M training costs have been debunked.

Amazon, Alphabet’s Google and Meta Platforms on Wednesday said they support efforts to at least triple nuclear energy worldwide by 2050.

The tech companies signed a pledge first adopted in December 2023 by more than 20 countries, including the U.S., at the U.N. Climate Change Conference. Financial institutions including Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley backed the pledge last year.


The pledge is nonbinding, but highlights the growing support for expanding nuclear power among leading industries, finance and governments.

Amazon, Google and Meta are increasingly important drivers of energy demand in the U.S. as they build out artificial intelligence centers. The tech sector is turning to nuclear power after concluding that renewables alone won’t provide enough reliable power for their energy needs.

Amazon and Google announced investments last October to help launch small nuclear reactors, technology still under development that the industry hopes will reduce the cost and timelines that have plagued new reactor builds in the U.S.

Meta issued a call in December for nuclear developers to submit proposals to help the tech company add up to four gigawatts of new nuclear in the U.S.

The pledge signed Wednesday was led by the World Nuclear Association on the sidelines of the CERAWeek by S&P Global energy conference in Houston.",374,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j9japl/amazon_google_and_meta_support_tripling_nuclear/

Google has the same choice today. Their classic search business has 90% market share and is hugely profitable. The population of the US is on Chat GPT already and more users join each day and services expand.

If AI is the future, the question is if we go from here to an AI search world will Google still have 90% market share and massive margins?

2025-03-11 17:47:59,Alphabet,GOOGL,This is your reminder to not pay for or listen to any social media/instagram day trader course,"These people are today’s snake oil salesmen. They don’t actually make money from trading stocks, and it’s obvious why because if they were truly profitable and consistently beating the market, they wouldn’t be selling you a course or subscription to a trading channel. They’d be running their own nine or ten-figure hedge fund or managing billion-dollar+ accounts for big banks if they were truly profitable and yielding 30-100% returns daily like they advertise.

They’re not in it to “help the little guy” or “take control of their life.” Selling courses is just their business model—*you* are the product. Your purchase funds their lifestyle, not their trading success. Most of them rent luxury cars, penthouses, and business-class flights, piling up credit card debt to maintain the illusion of wealth. A few do make real money, but not from trading, just from selling the dream of financial freedom.

It’s an easy trap, especially for people struggling and down bad in life, as these people are the easiest to manipulate. The idea of making a fortune from home, being your own boss, and escaping the 9-to-5 is incredibly tempting. No one exploits that better than these so called “trading gurus.”

A prime example is Aristotle Investments, who preys on low-income African Americans who have zero on knowledge of derivatives, selling them the fantasy of overnight success with the riskiest asset class possible (options). Everything they do is a scam and meant to project and certain marketing image of success. All of these trading pages buy followers, pay for promotions on meme pages, clean up their Google search results, have bot armies for their comments and pay for Chinese bots to pump up video views. Their 'live trading' isn't real. EVERYTHING they do is a facade. Others, like Timothy Sykes, were among the first to popularize this scam. The truth is, anyone selling a day trading course (or any almost any course) on social media is a fraud. Ironically, most of them don’t even rely on trading themselves—they park their money in index funds, because that’s what actually works for anyone worth less than eight figures. There are actually decent pages run by people who have good intentions such as TheMarketHustle, who advertise simple methods of index investing which is what 99.99% of people should be listening to, not day trading options or even buying individual stocks. 

The scam has become so popular and oversaturated that now scammers are teaching others how to start their own social media day trading scam and sell courses themselves. There’s an entire market built around projecting an image on social media and selling bullshit courses of all sorts. It's people who refuse to get real jobs and instead make a living scamming others. It works because nothing sells harder than a dream, and there’s always someone desperate enough to believe it.",276,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j8wt2f/this_is_your_reminder_to_not_pay_for_or_listen_to/
2025-03-11 17:12:13,Alphabet,GOOGL,Trump's DOJ wants a Google breakup but is willing to leave AI alone,"President Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, now largely agree on a major point that has the potential to reshape the tech world: Google should be broken up.

But there is an important difference that emerged in a filing last Friday: Trump’s Justice Department wants to let Google (GOOG, GOOGL) keep its investments in artificial intelligence. It notably has a stake in OpenAI rival Anthropic worth billions.

Backing off the Biden administration's request to force Google to sell off its AI bets was ""significant"" and ""very justified,"" said Mark McCareins, a business law professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management.

It ""may be an indication that the government worries about deterring AI advances in the global race with China,"" added David Olson, associate law professor at Boston College Law School.

The stock of Google's parent, Alphabet, dropped more than 4% Monday as other tech stocks also sold off on macroeconomic concerns.

The final decision on what happens to Google's $2 trillion empire in court will be in the hands of federal judge Amit Mehta, who ruled last August that Google illegally monopolized online markets for ""general search"" and ""general search text.”

No matter what Mehta decides, Google is expected to appeal, and the DOJ can too. Hearings to decide on remedies in this case are slated for April and May.

Final remedy recommendations from the government and Google were due to the judge Friday, giving a Trump-led DOJ one last chance to alter the prior Biden-era suggestion to the judge that Google be broken up with the forced sale of Google’s Chrome browser or contingent sale of its Android operating system.

It didn’t do so, despite being lobbied by the company to reconsider the Chrome proposal on national security concerns.

""Google must divest the Chrome browser — an important search access point,"" the DOJ stated in its final proposal on Friday.

It argued that under a different owner, new rivals would have an “opportunity to operate a significant gateway to search the internet, free of Google’s monopoly control.”

They also retained part of a request to leave the door open to a possible divestiture of Google's Android operating system.

But prosecutors did drop the Biden DOJ's push for Google to sell off its AI bets, instead suggesting a setup where federal authorities could keep tabs on proposed AI investments that could threaten search competition.

Anthropic has argued to the judge that forcing Google to relinquish its stake would tilt the AI playing field in favor of OpenAI and its backer, Microsoft (MSFT).

“Plaintiffs no longer seek the mandatory divestiture of Google’s AI investments,” the DOJ said Friday in its revised proposal.

Derek Mountford, a shareholder in Gunster's business litigation practice group who specializes in antitrust litigation, said while the Trump administration's AI rollback is a concession, it comes with a hook.

""They're asking for some reporting requirements to be attached to it,"" he said.

""I think one of the [antitrust] themes you might see in a second Trump administration is even if they're walking back some of the proposed sanctions, there's still that element of control and monitoring and enforcement that's going on in the background.""

The tension for the Trump administration, Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich told Yahoo Finance last week, is that it is engaged in an existential fight with China for the future of AI and Google can still be an important weapon for the US.

""What are we going to do, hobble one of our main US runners in that race by breaking up that company?” asked Kovacevich, who previously led Google's US policy strategy and external affairs team.

""It seems ill-timed to do that.""

The DOJ did stick with another expected remedy proposal that strikes at a major contention in the case.

It asked the judge to block Google from contracts that secure its search engine as the default across dozens of internet-connected devices, such as mobile phones made by Apple (AAPL), Samsung, and others, and browsers, including Apple’s Safari and Mozilla’s Firefox.

That is not good news for Apple, jeopardizing a major revenue stream. In 2021, Google paid $26 billion for default search placements, and the lion's share of that went to Apple.

Bernstein analysts have estimated Apple’s revenue from Google Search defaults is somewhere between $18 billion and $20 billion per year.

Google countered the DOJ’s request on Friday by asking that it still be free to enter into contracts to make Google search a default — so long as it does not condition search licensing based on device manufacturers also agreeing to distribute, preload, place, display, use, or license its AI Gemini Assistant Application.

McCareins, the law professor at Kellogg, said the DOJ has little to lose at this stage by holding on to Chrome divestment as a negotiating chip, given that both the underlying case and the judge's decision on remedies are subject to appeal.

""Just from a bargaining negotiating position, at this stage of the proceedings, I am not shocked or stunned that the new sheriffs in town have continued to argue for divestiture of Chrome,"" McCareins said.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

* In an annual filing Wednesday, Nvidia listed Huawei among its current competitors.
* Since 2019, the U.S. has restricted Huawei’s ability to access technology from American suppliers, from advanced 5G chips to Google’s Android operating system.

In an annual filing Wednesday, Nvidia listed Huawei among its [current competitors](https://s201.q4cdn.com/141608511/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/177440d5-3b32-4185-8cc8-95500a9dc783.pdf), including it in the list for [a second straight year](https://s201.q4cdn.com/141608511/files/doc_financials/2024/q4/1cbe8fe7-e08a-46e3-8dcc-b429fc06c1a4.pdf). The company, blacklisted by the U.S. for national security reasons, did not feature among Nvidia’s competitors for at least three prior years.

Nvidia listed Huawei among its competitors in four of five categories, including chips, cloud services, computing processing and networking products.

“There’s a fair amount of competition in China,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC’s Jon Fortt Wednesday.

“Huawei, other companies, are ... quite vigorous and very, very competitive,” Huang said.

Since 2019, the U.S. has restricted Huawei’s ability to access technology from American suppliers, from advanced [5G chips](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-08-20/pdf/2020-18213.pdf) to [Google’s Android operating system](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/20/google-stops-some-business-with-huawei-could-hit-its-global-smartphone-ambitions.html).

Huawei’s revenue exceeded 860 billion yuan ($118.27 billion) in 2024, state media reported, [a 22% jump in revenue from 2023](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/06/china-huawei-revenue-surges-despite-us-sanctions.html), and the fastest growth since a 32% increase in 2016, according to CNBC calculations of publicly released figures. Huawei typically [publishes its annual reports in March](https://www.huawei.com/en/annual-report).

The company’s revenue barely grew in 2020, and plunged by nearly 29% in 2021. Its consumer segment was hit hard, and even as revenue rose 17% year on year to 251.5 billion yuan in 2023, it was just over half of what the unit generated at its [peak in 2020](https://www-file.huawei.com/-/media/corp2020/annual-report/2020-pdf/annual_report_2020_en.pdf?la=en).

The telecommunications company started to make a comeback in the smartphone market [in 2023](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/27/huawei-q3-earnings-revenue-barely-grew-despite-growing-phone-car-sales.html) with the release of its Mate 60 Pro in China.

2025-02-28 14:47:56,Alphabet,GOOGL,Skype to Shut 14 Years After Microsoft’s $8.5 Billion Purchase,">Microsoft Corp. is signaling the end of the line for Skype, the iconic internet calling and chat service it bought almost 14 years ago.

>Once a byword for digital calls that bypassed long-distance charges, Skype was surpassed in recent years by smartphone-native communication apps and Zoom video calls. When Microsoft tried to stretch the Skype brand into the workplace, it lost out to Slack Technologies Inc.

>Microsoft’s response was to start from scratch and build Teams, a chat, voice and video communication service for the workplace, which gained ground as part of its software bundle. The Redmond, Washington-based company will offer Skype users the option of migrating to Teams, which is now its strongest rival to Salesforce Inc.-owned Slack, before it shuts down in May.

>“I’ve been at Microsoft for over 30 years, and there’s a lot of software that we’ve done that was incredibly valuable in its era, and then the next era came and it was the foundation,” said Jeff Teper, a Microsoft president who oversees communications and collaboration tools.

>Microsoft said there were more than 300 million monthly Skype users in 2016, but its daily user count had dwindled to 36 million in 2023. Teams, by comparison, has risen to 320 million monthly users.

>Founded in 2003 by Nordic entrepreneurs, Skype at one time was owned by eBay Inc. and was in the hands of a private equity-led consortium when Steve Ballmer came knocking. The then-Microsoft boss made an uncharacteristically splashy bet on the market leader in online calls, paying $8.5 billion, a 40% premium to Skype’s internal valuation. The May 2011 deal was the largest acquisition by Microsoft at the time, and Skype became a key piece of its strategy for the emerging mobile age.

>It didn’t pan out as Ballmer would have hoped. Upstarts like Telegram, Snapchat, WeChat and WhatsApp solved problems that Skype didn’t. Microsoft’s center of gravity in corporate software ultimately ensnared Skype, which found itself in the Office division and under orders to build tools geared toward a workplace audience as well as a consumer one.

>By the time Slack arrived on the scene, Skype users were complaining that elements of the core experience had started to break down. They cited missed or phantom calls and failures to sync information on different devices. The company worked to improve the service’s reliability, but some loyal users were put off by frequent redesigns, including a short-lived effort to fashion Skype in the mold of Snapchat.

>Microsoft, which also saw its acquisition of Nokia Oyj’s mobile phone business end in failure, is far from alone in encountering rejection by a fickle consumer market. Alphabet Inc.’s Google has cycled through several iterations and brands for its online communications tools, which are today known as Chat and Meet. And this month, Amazon.com Inc. said it would be winding down Chime, the video and voice calling service it tried with little success to sell to corporate clients.

>The Windows maker is shuttering Skype to focus on developing new features for Teams, including artificial intelligence tools, Teper said. The company is working to infuse AI into its product suite, while keeping a lid on spending that isn’t part of that effort. It’s reassigning staff that had worked on Skype to other areas of the business and will not lay anyone off, Teper added.

>At one point, Skype played host to one of Microsoft’s biggest AI demonstrations: a real-time translator. Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella had nudged researchers to bring the product to market as quickly as possible and heralded it as “magical” in a 2014 demonstration early on in his tenure.

>Teams is “going well and this is a step to double down on it,” Teper said, adding that Microsoft wanted to keep Skype running until it was confident that the Teams version for individual users was fully ready. “It’s the most successful product in its category by far,” he said.

**My Take:** Thank god. ZM might stand to be a major benefactor from this. MSFT already has Teams that serves as a workplace call tool, but Skype has tried to expand into the workplace forum space (like Slack) and has failed. MSFT is citing this more as a doubling-down on Teams rather than admitting ZM has eaten their lunch here.",2651,299,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j09c5p/skype_to_shut_14_years_after_microsofts_85/

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments.

The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

News: [Nvidia Gives Upbeat Forecast In Sign That AI Build Out Is Strong](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-26/nvidia-gives-upbeat-forecast-in-sign-that-ai-build-out-is-strong)

**Ticker:** [**NVDA (Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Reported earnings with EPS of $0.89 vs. $0.84 exp and revenue of $39.33B vs. $38.05B exp.

Provided strong guidance, anticipating revenue of $43B vs  $41.78B exp.

Performance is driven by robust demand for Nvidia's Blackwell AI chips, positioning the company to maintain its growth trajectory in the AI sector.

Overall a good earnings report, we're not going to see the stock explode like we did previously with the earnings beats.

**Technicals:** Watching $135 level, other than that I don't anticipate a major selloff due to the earnings news- maybe due to the jobs/macro news instead.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Overall not as explosive as the market wanted it to be. Growth was largely driven by advancements in AI (as usual).

Company said they were still demand constrained, even with export controls.

**Risks:** Potential supply chain disruptions/geopolitical tensions, greater export controls as mentioned previously, and increased competition.

**Related Tickers:** AMD, INTC, QCOM

**Ticker:** [**APP (AppLovin)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=APP&p=d)

**Catalyst:** A recent short report has been released, alleging that the company's application functions as spyware.

This follows a similar report from approximately a week ago.

**Technicals:** Yesterday I was mainly interested in being long if we broke $300 and had a recovery- I read both of the short reports and they said very similar things, so I thought the selloff was overblown.

Bought a little below $290, still holding. Will likely bail if we break $300 again.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** APP is a mobile tech company that helps devs market/monetize their apps through mobile advertising and marketing platforms, recently announced they were using AI.

**Risks:** The short report allegations are true and they essentially get banned from the Google App/Apple App Store.

**Related Tickers:** SNAP, PINS, TTD

**Ticker:** [**MRNA (Moderna)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MRNA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** U.S. health officials are reevaluating a $590 million contract awarded to MRNA for bird flu vaccines.

**Technicals:** We saw a decent dip (roughly 5%) in MRNA afterhours yesterday, not too interested in this further unless we see further headlines about the contract being pulled completely.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** MRNA had massive growth during 2020 for being one of the main manufacturers of the COVID vaccine- right now bird flu is being touted as the next potential big pandemic to vaccinate against.

**Risks:** Cancellation is the the real catalyst after this news, or if the contract is awarded to a different company.

**Related Tickers:** PFE, NVAX

**Ticker:** [**SNOW (Snowflake)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SNOW&p=d)

**Catalyst:** SNOW beat expectations, EPS of $0.30 vs. $0.18 exp. and revenue of $986.8M vs. $957.6M exp.

The company also provided an optimistic outlook, projecting current-quarter product revenue between $955M-$960M, driven by increasing demand for AI-related products.

**Technicals:** Interested in $190 level.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** SNOW is a cloud-based data warehousing company and benefits from the demand for AI/ML solutions.

AI is compute intensive which means they can charge more for their services. Also announced integration with Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service.

**Risks:** SNOW doesn't generate GAAP profits still, data breaches, competitors, etc.

# [Stock futures are flat after S&P 500 posts 3-day losing streak: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/24/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures were little changed Tuesday after the S&P 500 posted a three-day losing streak, with traders weighing concerns around global trade.
*****
> Futures tied to the S&P 500 inched up around 0.1%, while the Nasdaq-100 futures traded near the flatline. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.2%.
*****
> Bitcoin prices fell below $90,000 overnight, marking their lowest their lowest level in three months. The blue chip coin is trading almost 20% below its all-time high reached on President Donald Trump’s inauguration day.
*****
> On Monday, shares of key tech companies dragged down the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite to session losses. That decline among tech names also pulled the Nasdaq Composite into negative territory year to date.
*****
> “Investors in the market more broadly, they sort of almost want to believe that the AI trade is over. They’re looking for evidence [and] reasons to doubt,” Doug Clinton, a managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, said on CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Monday. “From our perspective, the AI trade is still real. I don’t think this boom is over. I still think we have two to four years to go.”
*****
> Investors are also mulling President Donald Trump’s latest remarks on trade. He said that tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico “will go forward” after the current 30-day moratorium ends.
*****
> Wall Street also turned its attention to key earnings reports. Home Depot reported fourth-quarter figures that beat analyst expectations, but the stock shed about 2% in the premarket.
*****
> Nvidia is set to report earnings Wednesday after the bell.
*****
> On the economic front, investors are turning their attention to the latest U.S. consumer confidence data due out at 10 a.m. ET. Economists polled by Dow Jones are expecting the Conference Board’s consumer confidence index to show a reading of 102.3 for February, less than the previous month’s reading of 104.1.
*****
> The report comes ahead of a slew of other economic data releases later in the week, including January’s personal consumption expenditures price index reading Friday. The PCE is the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge.

While the telehealth provider posted a fourth-quarter earnings and revenue beat, it said it would no longer be able to sell compounded versions of weight loss drugs after the first quarter.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2025-02-21 01:49:42,Alphabet,GOOGL,Valuation On $Unity post earnings with FCF model,"Based on the latest earnings call from Unity and looking at their potential for FCF growth I see a lot of upside potential. With using a conservative discount rate and execution risk premium I arrive at around $59 a share or $47 if you like a 20% safety factor. Today they showed 60% yoy FCF growth. So basically the main assumption is if they grow they hit that next year and then start to taper that growth rate down over 10 years to terminal growth of 6% this is the intrinsic value of the stock. 

I'm looking for feedback on this model. Let me know what you think of the assumptions and growth rate projections. Let me know if you think I'm crazy or it sucks or whatever! Thanks in advance!

Palantir has been on a tear recently, all hyped up on the defense sector growth but no one is really paying attention to Meta Defense and their entry to the space. Last year Meta opened up its AI models to defense agencies and contractors. This is huge for them to get this level of clearance and i think this will will put them in direct competition with Palantir. Im not sure how they build out this branch of Meta, Im calling it Meta Defense but they fired all their woke people and are starting to re-shape the company.

Yes, there is defense spending cuts but its all on waste and overcharged contracts not on things that actually matter for the dept of defense. During the inauguration Zuckerberg was in the front row, Hegseth was somewhere in the back. Just an observation.

Everyone is familiar with their social media business so there isnt a whole lot to talk about there. AI keeps improving, More growth from Reels, Threads, Facebook. Their LLM is impressive and arguably one of the best, putting them up there with OpenAI.

With all there user data they have Meta Analytics could be another source of revenue.

They are sitting on a goldmine with Facebook market place. i get they have ads but i feel they could do more.  Im not sure Zuckerberg realized what he has there but this business if monetized right could be HUGE.

2025-02-19 19:43:58,Alphabet,GOOGL,"Microsoft reveals its first quantum computing chip, the Majorana 1","[https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/19/microsoft-reveals-its-first-quantum-computing-chip-the-majorana-1.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/19/microsoft-reveals-its-first-quantum-computing-chip-the-majorana-1.html)

Microsoft on Wednesday announced Majorana 1, its first quantum computing chip. 

The achievement comes after the company has spent nearly two decades of research in the field. 

Technologists believe quantum computers could one day efficiently solve problems that would be taxing if not impossible for classical computers. Today’s computers use bits that can be either on or off while quantum computers employ quantum bits, or qubits, that can operate in both states simultaneously.

Google and IBM have also developed quantum processors, as have smaller companies IonQ and Rigetti Computing. Microsoft’s quantum chip employs eight topological qubits using indium arsenide, which is a semiconductor, and aluminum, which is a superconductor. A new paper in the journal Nature describes the chip in detail.

Microsoft won’t be allowing clients to use its Majorana 1 chip through the company’s Azure public cloud, as it plans to do with its custom artificial intelligence chip, Maia 100. Instead, Majorana 1 is a step toward a goal of a million qubits on a chip, following extensive physics research.

Rather than rely on Taiwan Semiconductor or another company for fabrication, Microsoft is manufacturing the components of Majorana 1 itself in the U.S. That’s possible because the work is unfolding at a small scale.

“We want to get to a few hundred qubits before we start talking about commercial reliability,” Jason Zander, a Microsoft executive vice president, told CNBC.

In the meantime, the company will engage with national laboratories and universities on research using Majorana 1. 

Despite the focus on research, investors are fascinated by quantum.

IonQ shares went up 237% in 2024, and Rigetti gained nearly 1,500%. The two generated a combined $14.8 million in third-quarter revenue. Further gains came in January, after Microsoft issued a blog post declaring that 2025 is “the year to become quantum-ready.”

Microsoft’s Azure Quantum cloud service, which lets developers experiment with programs and algorithms, offers access to chips from IonQ and Rigetti. It’s possible that a Microsoft quantum chip might become available through Azure before 2030, Zander said.

“There’s a lot of speculation that we’re decades off from this,” he said. “We believe it’s more like years.”

Rather than exist as a stand-alone category, quantum computing might end up boosting other parts of Microsoft. For example, there’s Microsoft’s AI business, which has an annualized revenue run rate that exceeds $13 billion. Quantum computers could be used to build data used to train AI models, Zander said. 

“Now you can ask it to invent some new molecule, invent some new drug, something that really would have been impossible to do before,” Zander said.",589,67,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1itekzw/microsoft_reveals_its_first_quantum_computing/

2025-02-19 05:02:59,Alphabet,GOOGL,What’s up with UnitedHealth Group falling 4.29% today?,"I’m a total pleb on this subject please don’t stone me to death lol. But I noticed that today and did some light googling and apparently that’s supposed to be pretty damn significant for the biggest health insurance company in the world. Its value has also fallen 14% in 6 months too.

Maybe I’m worried about nothing, but I thought that’s like kind of a newsworthy thing usually.

Also, this part is freakin me out, might be bs, but it’s very weird: like dozens of people all over social media in the last 48 hours are Claiming they and 20-30K other people are getting laid off there. Again maybe that isn’t true but it seems odd that lots of Joe shmo Karen types are making tik toks, tweets and Facebook posts saying they have to take a buy out by May 1st. I think there’s a larger Reddit post as well. 

There’s literally no media coverage at all on that tho. So like could be a total rumor. Tho an oddly specific insane one. But I thought it odd that the stock price also fell 4.29% today and like maybe that’s not actually that much in the grand scheme… but maybe it’s also a big deal? Like tik tok rumors don’t usually cost billions of dollars lol. 

Any insight would be rad! Would be lovely for any friendly folk to alleviate my concerns if possible lol.

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments.

The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

Most interesting news today is the hope that the meeting between Russian/US officials may end the three-year war in Ukraine, in addition to release of the Grok-3 model from xAI (Elon Musk's AI startup.)

News: [Musk S Xai Debuts Grok 3 Ai Bot Touting Benchmark Superiority](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-18/musk-s-xai-debuts-grok-3-ai-bot-touting-benchmark-superiority)

**Ticker:** [**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)/[**SMH**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SMH&p=d)/every semis and AI facing stock

**Catalyst:** Elon Musk's AI startup, xAI, has unveiled its latest model, Grok-3, claiming it surpasses competitors like GPT-4o, Google Gemini, DeepSeek V3, and Claude.

These assertions have not been independently verified by the open sourcen community but it wouldn't be surprising if it could surpass 4o (the model is close to a year old now)

**Technicals:** No real level I've been watching in NVDA, SMH, already positioned long. Note that xAI uses NVDA GPU's specifically in their super computer.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** We've seen a very strong recovery since the Deepseek fears caused a selloff. Personally I don't think xAI will cause the same effect that Deepseek did, but I think that the semis are a winner of this again.

**Risks:** Unverified performance claims may lead to skepticism among investors and potential customers, impacting adoption rates and market trust. XAI has a “Colossus supercomputer,” for training AI, which it said last year was utilizing a cluster of 100,000 advanced Nvidia GPUs for AI training.

Today, the company revealed that it doubled the size of its GPU cluster for the training of Grok 3.

**Related Tickers:** ARM, AMD, INTC

**Offhand Comments:** May see reversal of news if performance doesn't match claims.

**Ticker:** [**HEES (Herc Holdings Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HEES&p=d)

**Catalyst:** HEES has confirmed a $105 per share acquisition offer from Herc Rentals, surpassing the previous $92 per share bid from United Rentals.

**Technicals:** Watching $100 level. They've accepted the bid so we might see trading closer to that bid price in the near future.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Equipment rental industry is witnessing consolidation due to decelerating growth since 2023 (other than that nothing explosive)

**Risks:** The bidding war may escalate acquisition costs, potentially leading to overvaluation and financial strain for the acquiring company.

**Related Tickers:** URI, HRI

**Ticker:** [**NKE (Nike Inc)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NKE&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Nike has announced a new brand collaboration with SKIMS, launching a line called NikeSKIMS.

**Technicals:** Watching $75 level.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** SKIMS is pretty popular- mainly does underwear/loungewear/shapewear but this might be more focused on athleisure. This could potentially make a difference in NKE sales- SKIMS also collaborated with The North Face in the past, so worth keeping track of this for future catalysts in case they work with other brands.

**Related Tickers:** LULU, UAA

**Catalyst:** Unconfirmed reports suggest that President Trump plans to demand $500 billion from Ukraine and seek U.S. control over the country's mineral resources.

These claims have not been reported by major U.S. news outlets but have appeared in international media (from India, Canada, UK)

**Technicals:** This catalyst has been ""semi-leaked"" for the past week but not ""fully confirmed"", but we would likely see a selloff in defense stocks if true.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** These companies would go to the downside from an end to the Ukraine war, and spike if talks aren't successful.

However, with it being a slow day in the market, I figured I'd share three stocks that I find really interesting. This is going to be a mix of a lighter version of a DD report, but mainly it's to highlight and bring up some interesting names out there. 

1. **$CTLP -  Cantaloupe, Inc**

A quick description of what they do: 

>The company offers integrated solutions for payments processing, logistics, and back-office management.

>It also provides G11 cashless and pulse kits that are 4G LTE digital payment devices for payment and consumer engagement applications; G11 chip kit, a digital reader that accepts contact EMV and contactless EMV payment methods; Engage series comprising Engage and Engage Combo, which are digital touchscreen devices that offers networking, security, and interactivity payment methods; and card touchscreen card readers, including P66, P100, P100Pro, and P30.

>In addition, the company offers self-checkout kiosks, smart store concepts, and the Cantaloupe Go management platform comprising Go Mini, Go MiniX, Go Plus100, Go Plus200, Go Plus300, Go Max, Cooler Cafe, and Smart Market; Go Portal, a robust cloud-based platform; and Cheq products, which supports attended and unattended self-service kiosks for the stadium, entertainment, and festival sectors.

The fundamentals: 

[https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CTLP&p=d](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CTLP&p=d)

While the stock might appear to be expensive on the TTM PE, the forward PE isn't nearly as bad, plus the company is now profitable and growing EPS nicely, so the PEG on the company is actually around 1.12. 

And there was some insider buying recently too: 

[http://openinsider.com/search?q=CTLP#google\_vignette](http://openinsider.com/search?q=CTLP#google_vignette)

What I find interesting about the company is that they are working with sports stadiums with their cashless kiosk systems. They currently operate in over 20 stadiums. It's actually a great case study on it for the commanders stadium called out on their site. 

[https://www.cantaloupe.com/business-types/sports-entertainment/stadiums-venues/](https://www.cantaloupe.com/business-types/sports-entertainment/stadiums-venues/)

WSJ actually had a a great vide on how the Saint's stadium is designed to maximize profits, which they talk about these type of kiosks as being big drivers.

**2. $FTI - TechnipFMC plc**

Quick Description of what they do:

>It operates through two segments: Subsea and Surface Technologies. The Subsea segment engages in the design, engineering, procurement, manufacturing, fabrication, installation, and life of field services for subsea systems, subsea field infrastructure, and subsea pipe systems used in oil and gas production and transportation.

>It provides subsea production and processing system; flexible pipe; subsea umbilicals, risers, and flowlines; vessels; robotics; well and asset services; and Subsea Studio for optimizing the development, execution, and operation of current and future subsea fields.

>The Surface Technologies segment designs, manufactures, and services products and systems used in land and shallow water exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas.

The Fundamentals:

I'm not the biggest expert around the oil market, but it does it does seem like the offshore market is actually growing. Plus add in the new Trump admin who is talking about ""drill baby drill"", FTI specializes in the offshore drilling market. 

I just think what they do with the subsea oil drilling is really interesting, especially with the use of robotics. 

[https://www.barrons.com/articles/oil-opportunities-offshore-growth-investments-8e0cb9d2](https://www.barrons.com/articles/oil-opportunities-offshore-growth-investments-8e0cb9d2)

>Shale is still growing. But analysts say fields are beginning to get exhausted, so production is starting to plateau. “Offshore is the only place that’s left to grow. The other thing about offshore, too, is that over the last five years, the average breakeven has come down from $75 \[per barrel\] to $50 or even $45,” said Simon Wong, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds.

>In 2025, growth from offshore oil drilling globally could surpass tight oil, or shale growth, for the first time in more than a dozen years, according to Rystad Energy. The consulting firm expects that trend to continue.

In their latest investor presentation, they actually called out that the total company backlog is now the highest level since the merger to create the company. 

They also have authorized their buybacks by 1B and have enough to take our around 10% of the float.

2025-02-16 23:57:09,Alphabet,GOOGL,Why are cloud stocks trading down despite high demand?,"Hello all,

Amazon, Microsoft, and Google are reporting sky-high demand—so much demand that they can’t even support it right now. In response, they’ve significantly increased their capital expenditures to scale up.

But here’s what’s puzzling me: The market didn’t like it. Stocks dropped.

I get that this impacts short-term free cash flow, but aren’t these investments setting them up for massive long-term returns? If demand is already exceeding supply, shouldn’t we expect higher growth and profitability down the line?

What do you think? Is the market being too short-sighted, or is there a risk we’re overlooking?",214,121,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ir6ekl/why_are_cloud_stocks_trading_down_despite_high/
2025-02-16 19:31:24,Alphabet,GOOGL,Any heard of/had experience with ADPV?,"Searched Reddit and Google in general but found close to nothing on this ticker so asking the community here.

Long story short I can no longer actively trade individual equities (work at financial firm with trading restriction). Thankfully all my current holdings are grandfathered, but I am free to trade ETF's and derivatives thereof so I was looking for something that could be a little more aggressive. Looked through a long list of the usual suspects of ETF's, but stumbled upon ADPV. Basically it selects 25 of the top-performing stocks in the market during bull runs, and then reverts to treasuries during bear markets. Ultimately I'm hoping this will get me exposure to new up-and-coming stocks/IPO's etc since I can't buy them myself, and the hedge is more of a bonus than anything.

Here are the drawbacks I can see:

1. 1% expense ratio. I pretty much hold all equities and index funds currently with zero ER or close to it, so this one hurts. But maybe it's worth it to scratch my trading itch which can no longer be satisfied.
2. Low volume. This would be for B&H and not for a huge portion of my portfolio so I don't think this would be an issue but would welcome your thoughts/negative experiences with low-volume/liquidity ETF's.
3. The methodology for rotating in and out of the 25 tickers isn't clear. So that's leaving a lot up to the fund management. Current top holding is PLTR (bought in 2023!) which may account for a lot of their recent performance.
4. Not much history as it's only a couple years old. However looking at their top holdings and buy dates they've done very well getting ahead of the curve on some big movers. Past performance not indicative..ofc ofc

2025-02-16 18:22:31,Alphabet,GOOGL,"Original Research - Avoid Baidu ($BIDU): ""Don't Get Tricked By China's AOL""; OR Why Its “Global AI” Hype Falls Flat","Baidu loves to sell itself as China’s leading AI innovator. Western investors often lump it in with Chinese “tech champions.” But a closer look reveals the truth: Baidu’s overseas presence is negligible—less than 1% of revenue—despite years of flashy announcements about AI labs, cloud services, and self-driving projects outside China. Its so-called global ambitions have barely moved the needle.

Baidu’s inability to generate meaningful overseas revenue, despite years of aggressive AI branding and expansion efforts, is not just a matter of tough market conditions—it is a clear indicator of deep structural problems within the company. This failure reflects fundamental issues with strategy execution, capital allocation, leadership decision-making, and competitive positioning.

In my view, Baidu is kind of like the worst house on a dangerous street: it's an aging property with structural issues, stuck in a declining neighborhood where better-built businesses have already moved on to safer, more lucrative markets. Investors hoping for a turnaround are betting on renovations that won't materialize, while smarter money flows into sturdier, globally competitive multi-nationals like Lenovo, Haier, Xiaomi, and BYD.

Baidu isn’t just in a tough spot—it’s in a market that’s moving past it.

# The Unfulfilled Dream of “China’s Google”

Baidu was once hailed as “China’s Google,” dominating a market where Google was blocked. That moniker created an expectation that it would naturally go global—just like Google did. However, every major overseas push from Baidu has fizzled:

* Japan Search Engine (launched in 2007) never surpassed low-single-digit market share and shut down in 2015.
* Southeast Asia Utility Apps saw initial downloads (DU Battery Saver, etc.) but failed to retain users; many apps were plagued by adware allegations.
* India Ban abruptly cut off a huge market in 2020 when geopolitical tensions led to restrictions on Chinese apps.
* Cloud and Robotaxis remain mostly China-centric, without the global scale of Alibaba Cloud or Huawei’s data centers.

Instead of becoming a global behemoth, Baidu is stuck with near-100% reliance on China’s ad market and domestic AI cloud business. Its “global AI champion” pitch sounds exciting, but there’s little actual revenue to back it up.

# Management’s Stop-and-Start Strategy

One reason for Baidu’s stagnation abroad is its on-again, off-again international focus:

* Internal shakeups and management turmoil kept the business pivoting from search to apps, from apps to AI, from AI to EV software, etc.
* These abrupt strategy shifts wasted capital and left foreign users unconvinced and Western rivals unchallenged.
* ByteDance, Alibaba, and Tencent moved faster and more decisively, seizing digital opportunities at home and abroad.

All this has left Baidu vulnerable to shifts in China’s macro and regulatory landscape—unlike peers that truly diversified overseas.

# Meanwhile, Other Chinese Companies Are Thriving Abroad

While Baidu’s overseas revenue remains a rounding error, several Chinese companies have systematically expanded beyond their home market—often capturing significant shares of revenue abroad:

**Lenovo**

* Generates \~75% of its revenue overseas in PCs, servers, and services.
* Successfully acquired IBM’s PC and server businesses, scaling up a global supply chain and brand presence.

**Haier**

* Over 50% of sales come from outside China.
* Bought iconic appliance brands like GE Appliances in the U.S., building localized manufacturing and distribution worldwide.

**Xiaomi**

* Aggressively moved into India, Southeast Asia, Europe, and more, combining cost-competitive smartphones with robust local partnerships.

**BYD & CATL**

* Leading the EV and battery space not just in China, but globally—securing deals with top automakers and scaling in Europe, the U.S., and beyond.

**WuXi Biologics, Transsion, Etc.**

Many other Chinese firms, from biotech to mobile phone brands, have established real foreign footprints that diversify their revenue streams.

These Chinese global players compete head-to-head with Western incumbents in advanced economies and capture demand in emerging markets—all while being priced far below many U.S. or European multinationals.

# Why Investors Should Care About Ex-China Successes 

1. Diversification Away from China’s Economy

Companies with 50–75% of sales overseas are far less vulnerable to a domestic slowdown or stricter policies at home.

2. Genuine Global Growth

These firms have already proven they can localize, partner, or acquire to enter new markets—unlike Baidu, which talks big but executes poorly.

3. Undervalued vs. Global Peers

Sentiment around “Chinese risk” keeps valuations low. However, the actual risk for globally diversified firms is materially different—and in many ways lower—than for a purely domestic player like Baidu.

4. Fast-Compounding International Revenues

If emerging markets in India, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East continue to boom—or if Western consumers embrace Chinese EVs and hardware—companies like Lenovo, Haier, Xiaomi, and BYD are already positioned to grab that growth.

# The Bottom Line: Steer Clear of Baidu, Focus on the Real Global Champs

* Baidu Is a Not-So-Awesome “China-Only” Story

Its domestic ad revenues are plateauing, short-video competitors are eating market share, and foreign expansions are just pilot projects that haven’t delivered meaningful sales.

* Baidu Overseas Hype Is Empty

A decade of repeated attempts—from search in Japan to robotaxis in the UAE—has not yielded substantial user adoption or revenue. There’s little reason to believe another pivot will magically pay off.

* Others Have Cracked the Code

Lenovo, Haier, Xiaomi, BYD, and others each show that Chinese firms can indeed thrive globally—but Baidu hasn’t replicated that success.

* There's Better Risk/Reward Elsewhere

Baidu trades at a discount that I initially found tempting for my own portfolio. Who doesn't want a future AI windfall? But that bet relies on overseas revenue magically materializing after a decade of tries. If you want an angle on Chinese equities, go for the companies that have already demonstrated they can succeed abroad—and leave Baidu, the “worst house on a dangerous street,” off your list.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I’ve put together the above analysis of Baidu. I work on these memos for my own personal investments. I do not hold Baidu. 

**TLDR:** My analysis indicates Baidu is a much weaker company than other Chinese tech stocks and conversely that other Chinese tech stocks are much more investable than I had previously expected.",43,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iqyofa/original_research_avoid_baidu_bidu_dont_get/
2025-02-16 09:00:31,Alphabet,GOOGL,Which stocks have the best leadership?,"After tracking countless stocks, I've found that besides fundamental earnings, companies' stock performances are largely supported by strong narratives, which strong or charismatic leadership can play a key role in perpetuating. Intangible factors like these are part of why I believe companies like Tesla trade at such higher multiples than companies like Google and Microsoft, where people like Elon can divert investors' attention away from fundamentals to distant visions of multi-industry dominance. 
That being said, I've compiled a few stocks that along with fundamentals have leadership that I believe can buoy future growth, such as OKLO, HIMS, and NVDA. Do you guys have any more suggestions prioritizing this factor?

2025-02-14 16:44:21,Alphabet,GOOGL,Meta plans major investment into AI-powered humanoid robots,"[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-plans-major-investment-ai-160000083.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-plans-major-investment-ai-160000083.html)

Meta Platforms Inc., after pushing into augmented reality and artificial intelligence, has identified its next big bet: AI-powered humanoid robots.

The company is making a significant investment into the category — futuristic robots that can act like humans and assist with physical tasks — and is forming a new team within its Reality Labs hardware division to conduct the work, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

Meta plans to work on its own humanoid robot hardware, with an initial focus on household chores. Its bigger ambition is to make the underlying AI, sensors and software for robots that will be manufactured and sold by a range of companies, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the initiative hasn’t been announced.

Meta has started discussing its plan with robotics companies, including Unitree Robotics and Figure AI Inc. At least initially, it doesn’t plan to build a Meta-branded robot — something that could directly rival Tesla Inc.’s Optimus — but it may consider doing so in the future, the people added.

The humanoid effort mirrors exploratory projects at other technology giants, including Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google Deepmind division. A Meta spokesperson declined to comment.

Meta confirmed the creation of the new team to employees Friday, telling them it will be led by Marc Whitten, who resigned as chief executive officer of General Motors Co.’s Cruise self-driving car division earlier this month. He was previously an executive at gaming company Unity Software Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.

“The core technologies we’ve already invested in and built across Reality Labs and AI are complementary to developing the advancements needed for robotics,” Andrew Bosworth, Meta’s chief technology officer, wrote in a memo reviewed by Bloomberg News. He mentioned the company’s advancements in hand tracking, computing at low bandwidth and always-on sensors.

Meta executives believe that while humanoid robotics companies have made headway in hardware, Meta’s advances in artificial intelligence and data collected from augmented and virtual reality devices could accelerate progress in the nascent industry. Current humanoids are still not useful enough to fold clothes, carry a glass of water, place dishes in a rack for cleaning or conduct other home chores that could get consumers interested in the category.

“We believe that expanding our portfolio to invest in this field will only accrue value to Meta AI and our mixed and augmented reality programs,” Bosworth wrote. Whitten, who will report to Bosworth, will have headcount to hire around 100 engineers this year, one of the people said.

Meta’s goal is to provide what Google’s Android operating system and Qualcomm Inc.’s chips did for the phone industry by building a foundation for the rest of the market.

The software, sensors and computing packages that Meta is already developing for its devices are the same technologies that are needed to power humanoids, according to one of the people involved in the project.

Meta has been investing billions of dollars for years into its Reality Labs hardware division, which sells products like the Quest VR headset and the increasingly popular Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta plans to spend $65 billion this year on related products, including artificial intelligence infrastructure and the new robot work.",120,86,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ipetzp/meta_plans_major_investment_into_aipowered/

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Questions:

	1.	I currently hold 29 stocks, which seems excessive. Are there any that you’d recommend as an immediate SELL?

	2.	Lately, I’ve been increasing my ETF allocation while reducing exposure to volatile stocks. Does this seem like a solid strategy, or should I continue investing in blue-chip tech stocks to maintain strong returns?

	3.	Any other feedback or recommendations?

While it may take a while, there's also plenty of good reasons I'm speculating (don't own any stock) for why Hyundai could be a good buy now. It's got a P/E of 4.39, 5.76% dividend, and the stock is slightly cheaper than usual in a sense as the Won has lost value this past year.

> Reddit shares fell more than 15% on Wednesday after the company reported weaker-than-expected user numbers in its fourth-quarter earnings. 

> Here’s how the company did compared with LSEG estimates: Earnings per share: 36 cents vs. 25 cents expected Revenue: $428 million vs. $405 million expected

> Global daily active uniques, or DAUq, rose 39% from a year earlier to an average of 101.7 million for the fourth quarter. That trailed Wall Street estimates of 103.1 million. A Google search algorithm change caused some “volatility” with user growth in fourth quarter, but the company’s search-related traffic has since recovered in the first quarter, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said in a letter to shareholders. “What happened wasn’t unusual — referrals from search fluctuate from time to time, and they primarily affect logged-out users,” Huffman wrote. 

> “Our teams have navigated numerous algorithm updates and did an excellent job adapting to these latest changes effectively.” Reddit has benefited from Google search updates and internal site improvements that have helped it gain a significant amount of new and returning users, which the social company refers to as logged-out users, over the past year and a half. Reddit has said it is working to convince logged-out users to create accounts as logged-in users, which are more lucrative for its business. Global logged-in DAUq grew 27% year over year to 46.1 million in the quarter while global logged-out DAUq rose 51% to 55.6 million, the company said.

> Despite missing on user number, the company otherwise reported a strong quarter and provided optimistic guidance. Reddit’s sales jumped 71% in the quarter from $250 million a year earlier, the fastest rate of growth for any quarter since 2022. The company said first-quarter sales will be between $360 million to $370 million, ahead of the average analyst estimate of $358 million. Net income almost quadrupled to $71 million or 36 cents a share, from $18.5 million, or breakeven on a per-share basis, a year earlier. Reddit reported adjusted earnings of $154 million in the fourth quarter, topping analysts’ expectations of $128 million.

**Ticker:** [**SPY**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SPY&p=d)**,** [**QQQ**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=QQQ&p=d)**,** [**VXX**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&p=d)**, UPRO and other market ETFs**

**Technicals:** Interested if we'll see another new low in the markets (breaking the market low the post-CPI report established).

**Catalyst:** CPI report of inflation gauges come in far higher than estimates, fed cuts seen less likely in first half of 2025, which resulted in a selloff for the entire market premarket. Inflation's back on the menu boys.

**Risks:** We'll likely see more volatility at the open obviously, and see more selloffs in the speculative/hype sectors, but I'm mainly focused on broader market movements and managing the PLTR short I mentioned yesterday.

**Ticker:** [**SMCI (Super Micro Computer, Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SMCI&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Super Micro Computer missed expectations and reduced its sales outlook for FY 2025, now projecting revenue between $23.5-$25B, down from the previous estimate of $26B- $30B.

The company also announced plans to submit delayed filings to the SEC by February 25 to avoid delisting.

**Technicals:** Ultimately a miss on earnings, but the news of submitting filings to the SEC was what made the stock recover afterhours yesterday. Not too interested in this until we get a news update on the filings that will determine if this is not as shady as Hindenburg makes it out to seem.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The semis sector is somewhat stressed due to the possible tariffs on semis coming in that Trump threatened. SMCI revising downward is clearly bad, while they expect growth in 2026 due to future growth from AI infrastructure demand.

Obviously if they fail to submit a delayed filing then that would be a brutal blow for the stock.

**Risks:** Most of them are detailed in Hindenburg's report (Link here: [Hindenburg Report](https://hindenburgresearch.com/smci/))

**Ticker:** [**RDFN (Redfin Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RDFN&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Zillow and RDFN announced a partnership making Zillow (ZG) the exclusive provider of multifamily rental listings (properties with 25+ units) on RDN and its sites.

**Technicals:** None to speak of, but partnering means their revenue is tied a little closer together, meaning they will trade together/greater correlation.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The real estate sector is increasingly focusing on user experiences through partnerships, rather than trying to expand outward- this allows them to charge a premium vs value.

This collaboration aims to provide renters with a more comprehensive search platform while expanding the reach for property marketers (ultimately an advertising play/commissions play for RDFN).

**Risks:** Probably regulatory issues, but likely won't be facing those in this admin.

**Ticker:** [**SWTX (SpringWorks Therapeutics, Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SWTX&p=d)

**Catalyst:** SWTX received FDA approval for GOMEKLI (mirdametinib) for the treatment of patients with neurofibromatosis type 1-associated plexiform neurofibromas (NF1-PN). TAM is roughly $1B yearly.

**Technicals:** $55 is the level.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Having ""the"" drug for treatment pretty much turns a nothing biotech stock into a somebody (which later leads to them getting acquired by a giant like MRK).

**Risks:** MRK calls deal off, which is the reason for the massive moves in the past 2 days and we see a reversal of that news.

2025-02-11 22:20:13,Alphabet,GOOGL,TSLA isn't the NVIDIA of EV's anymore,"

I’m no Tesla expert, and I’m sure plenty of people know way more about the company than I do, but I wanted to throw out some thoughts and see what you all think.



Right now, TSLA is sitting around $330 a share, up 75% YOY. But honestly, I see some major red flags:



📉 Shrinking Profit Margins – Tesla’s margins have been steadily declining for years. Not a great trend.



🏴‍☠️ Musk’s PR Nightmare – Elon literally gave a “Sieg Heil” on live TV. Now, a huge chunk of the world sees him (and by extension, Tesla) as a Nazi. That’s… not exactly great for brand reputation.



🚗 Cybertruck is a Mess – Poor build quality, tons of issues, and at this point, it’s basically a meme.



🌍 New Political & Tariff Risks – Tesla is vulnerable to steel and aluminum tariffs, an anti-EV U.S. President, and a California governor who hates Musk and might pull state EV rebates.



⚡ Serious Competition is Catching Up – Tesla isn’t the undisputed EV/FSD leader anymore. Other companies are matching—or surpassing—them in innovation.



🚦 FSD is Overhyped – Despite all the robotaxi talk, Tesla’s self-driving tech is still only Level 2-3. Meanwhile, other companies already have Level 4 robotaxis on the road.



🔋 Rising Costs = Profit Squeeze – Raw material costs are going up, and Trump’s tariffs on China-made batteries could make things even worse.



🤖 Tesla is Struggling to Attract Top AI Talent – Even before Musk’s latest antics, nearly all top AI researchers and recent ML PhD graduates from the top schools were choosing OpenAI, Anthropic, or GAMMA (Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Apple) over Tesla or xAI. Now? Even fewer want to work there, which could hurt Tesla’s AI progress.



🔵 Losing Left-Leaning Consumers – Left-leaning buyers are way more likely to buy EVs than right-leaning ones. And almost every left-leaning consumer has grown to despise Musk, leading them to choose non-Tesla EVs instead.



Tesla used to be the Nvidia of EVs—they were miles ahead of everyone else. But that’s just not the case anymore. There are more non-Tesla EV options every year, and in terms of FSD, several companies already have a better product and better talent. So, to me, a $1.1 trillion valuation feels ridiculous.



What do you guys think? Am I being too bearish, or is Tesla in for some rough times ahead?",3343,603,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1inb7p0/tsla_isnt_the_nvidia_of_evs_anymore/

2025-02-10 16:59:25,Alphabet,GOOGL,NBIS is the best AI play available in the market right now,"As the title says, it's the best AI play available to all of us right now. Following are some of the stats 

1.Recently raised $700M in strategic equity financing to expand AI infrastructure globally including investment from big Daddy Nvidia.

2. It's a spinoff from Yandex their Russian Arm(google of Russia) so the guys are pretty good and know how to build a solid business.

3. Got solid bank balance, they have around $2B in cash to fuel any of their upcoming projects.

4. Financials are also not bad : The old firm Yandex did the follow 
2019–2023: Revenue grew consistently, with notable jumps:
2020: $2.40B (+24.49% YoY)
2021: $3.92B (+63.12% YoY)
2022: $5.74B (+46.47% YoY)
2023: $8.9B (+24.35% YoY)

For NBIS FY24 Q3 revenue is $43M, and they are expecting around $700M and heading towards EBITDA +ve in Early FY25

5. For all you AI tech nerds, let me also throw some light on the subsidiaries under this group.

Toloka: Data solutions for generative AI.
TripleTen: Edtech for tech career reskilling.
Avride: Autonomous driving technology.

And bdw Avride is also a fucking solid company in the autonomous driving space.

A multiyear strategic partnership for integrating Avride’s autonomous delivery robots and vehicles into Uber’s platform.

So imagine these lads having already functioning delivery robots and robotaxis.

I am telling you the stock is cheap as fuck with a Market Cap of $9B. Just for reference Yandex was values at $31B. So there is a lot of scope guys


Also below are some of the notable shareholders 

UBS, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley etc..all of them having more than $100M invested individually.

This is still just the beginning so buy the fuck out of it if you really want your money to double up this year. It's an easy $ 60  a sharw

Amazon down 4% after releasing earnings recently. AWS results came in lower than expected & guidance for next quarter's revenue & profit came up short

Curious what others go from here. For some long-term investors, it's a dip for a buying opportunity. Some might stay away given limited upside with DeepSeek, high Capex, and softer revenue growth.

2025-02-08 16:17:42,Alphabet,GOOGL,"Amazon, Like Microsoft, Says It Can’t Keep Up With AI Demand","* Company likely to invest $100 billion in 2025 capital expenses
* Cloud unit sales increase 19% for the third straight quarter

>Amazon.com Inc. warned investors that it could face capacity constraints in its cloud computing division despite plans to invest some $100 billion this year, with most of the money going toward data centers, homegrown chips and other equipment to provide artificial intelligence services.

>Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy, determined to turn Amazon into an AI supermarket, is spending big to retain the company’s edge in cloud-computing services. Still, he warned growth would be “lumpy” owing to challenges securing sufficient hardware and electricity.

>“It is true we could be growing faster were it not for some of the constraints on capacity,” Jassy said on a conference call Thursday after the release of fourth-quarter results.

>The concerns echo those of rival Microsoft Corp., which last week said its cloud sales growth was hurt because it didn’t have enough data centers to handle demand for its AI products.

>Jassy said power capacity and the supply of chips — from third parties and Amazon’s own design unit — are limiting the ability of Amazon Web Services to bring new data centers online. Those constraints will likely ease in the second half of 2025, he said.

>Amazon spent $26.3 billion in capital expenditures in the last three months of 2024, the vast majority of which went toward AI-related projects within AWS. Jassy told analysts on the call that the amount was “reasonably representative” of the rate of outlays the company planned to make in 2025.

>The company reported that AWS revenue jumped 19% to $28.8 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31. It was the third straight period of 19% growth for the cloud unit.

>“AWS growth did not accelerate as anticipated and instead matched Q3 levels, indicating that the company is challenged by the same types of capacity constraints facing rivals Google and Microsoft,” said Sky Canaves, an analyst at Emarketer.

>Jassy’s warning on AWS growth constraints overshadowed a fairly strong holiday quarter, suggesting the company’s main e-commerce and logistics business is fending off competition from Walmart Inc. and discount upstarts like Temu and Shein.

>The shares declined almost 3% as the markets opened on Friday in New York. The stock had previously gained 8.9% so far this year after a 44% jump in 2024.

>The AI race will likely weigh down profits. Operating income will be $14 billion to $18 billion in the period ending in March, the Seattle-based company said in a statement. Analysts, on average, projected $18.2 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. First-quarter sales will be as much as $155.5 billion, compared with an average estimate of $158.6 billion.

>While Amazon’s overall quarter was generally positive, “investors immediate concerns are around Q1 guidance, which was below expectations, mostly because of the impact of a big currency drag and the impact of lapping a leap year,” said Gil Luria, an analyst at DA Davidson & Co. The company said the extra day in the quarter in 2024 boosted sales by about $1.5 billion.

>Total revenue in the holiday quarter increased 10% to $187.8 billion, slightly ahead of analyst estimates. Operating profit was $21.2 billion, compared with the average estimate of $18.8 billion.

>Total operating expenses rose 6.2% to $166.6 billion — marking the eighth consecutive quarter that Amazon’s revenue increased at a higher rate than costs. The company employed more than 1.55 million full- and part-time workers at the end of the quarter, a 2% increase from a year earlier.

2025-02-07 20:02:39,Alphabet,GOOGL,Palantir investors: let's do a thought experiment!,"Right now, PLTR's valuation sits around 90 times trailing revenues. Now, there is no longer any credible argument that it isn't a very good business. You don't grow at 30+ year over year with fantastic margins and tons of cash on the balance sheet without being a high quality company.

But let's do a comparison where we apply the same valuation multiple to the cloud businesses of Google and Microsoft. The comparisons are drawn because these are also segments growing consistently at around 30% per year with huge runways, dominant positions in AI, and have all said they literally could not keep up with demand in the previous quarters. 

With a 90x sales multiple, you could completely gut Google's search business and youtube business, light that money on fire, and only value the entire company based on Google cloud. With the same valuation as PLTR is at right now, you would instantly double the size of Alphabet and turn it into the biggest company in the world at around a 4 trillion dollar market cap. 

Let's do Microsoft. This one is a bit tougher because they don't break out the exact numbers that Azure does, but just leave it inside the intelligent cloud umbrella. That said, it's part of a 90-100B dollar segment, is growing at 30% and has an even bigger market share than Google cloud. So let's call it around a 60B per year run rate? If we applied the same method to Azure as we did to Google cloud, we could turn Microsoft into a bigger business than Amazon and Nvidia combined, while also lighting the other 60% of Microsoft's business on fire. 

I'm not suggesting Palantir isn't a fantastic business with a long runway for growth. I am suggesting that the expectations for performance going forward for you to still earn a return are absolutely astronomical at this point.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2025-02-05 18:54:07,Alphabet,GOOGL,Thinking about NVDA beyond 2025 Hyperscaler CapEx Growth,"With 3/4 hyperscalers reporting earnings already, the reaction to Nvidia has been positive, but stock still trades less than before DeepSeek. I believe the sentiment is that while 2025 will be great, Nvidia is nearing the ""end of great times"" and moving to a ""just good times"".

**Here's my take at a breakdown. I am not an expert, but have read a lot of positive and negative takes, I'm starting this thread to start a discussion not to pump the stock. Please don't comment ""Nvidia diamond hands durr"".** I didn't use AI to write this sadly.

I can't link out to some of the resources, but tried to describe them for easy search and find.

**TLDR:** Meeting 2025 revenue projections isn't at excessive risk based on CapEx raises so far. It's likely that production capacity may really be the limiting reagent for 2025 revenues not demand. Market is forward looking and there is uncertainity on 2026+ revenues (DeepSeek is one of them) - markets don't like that. However, uncertainity is an opportunity if Nvidia can deliver again - remember stocks climb a wall of worry.

**Disclosure:** Own a lot of NVDA. But have covered calls on them, so not a blindfold risktaker.

**Personal take:** NVDA is attractive at these levels, but I'd be cautious holding my entire position after the summer 2025 earnings calls from the hyperscalers, because if there's any indication there is a 2026 CapEx slowdown, stock could fall a lot. I can't predict the future, so diversification is important even if you like the stock.

However, continued chip innovation that maintains a competitive advantage that leads to higher end customer ROIs compared to other chip alternatives would help. Also, release of one tangible AI product would change the sentiment and game here (e.g. Robotaxis, enterprise solutions used common place for F500 companies, etc). Many are already underway - my company is releasing Gemini for all employees - this goes beyond software engineers. I think diversification across the industry (AVGO, TSM, power producers) could be valuable as time progresses as the AI use case boom happens.

\-----------------------------------------

**(1) Meeting 2025 Revenue projections isn't at excessive risk based on CapEx raises so far**

Based on [stockanalysis](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/nvda/forecast/) consensus 2024 to 2025 revenue growth is estimated to be 52%.

1. MSFT: 55.7B in 2024 to 80B in 2025
2. Google: 52.5B in 2024 to 75B in 2025
3. Meta: 39B in 2024 to 60B - 60B in 2025

Based on the numbers written above, the anticipated growth from hyperscaler capex spend is 46% (if we assume concentration of NVDA chip spend as percent of capex steady). Hyperscalers are estimated to be about 50% of Nvidia revenue. To reach the 52% target that means from the remainder of the revenue book, Nvidia needs 58% spend increase.

This doesn't seem unreasonable. **Potential** investments through StarGate (Oracle), OpenAI's increasingly independent spending funded by Softbank, and sovereign AI investments are a tailwind to that figure. However, sustained export controls (e.g. Biden's global export framework) and increased crackdowns are headwinds.

**(2) It's likely that production capacity may really be the limiting reagent for 2025 revenues not demand**

Based on multiple [sources](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidias-blackwell-gpus-are-sold-out-for-the-next-12-months-chipmaker-to-gain-market-share-in-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com), seems like Blackweel is sold out for the next 12 months anyways. So 2025 revenues may be a matter of strong production. Moreover, from the commentary that google had on their earnings call - seems like cloud growth is supply constrained by infrastructure rather than demand constrained. I believe for 2025 at least customers will buy as many NVIDIA chips as they can and its production that determines valuation.

Since the market is forward looking, 2025 revenue misses won't be as crucial as addressing the question of when is the demand going to slow down and the AI semiconductor sales from NVDA slowdown?

**(3) Market is forward looking and there is uncertainity on 2026+ revenues (DeepSeek is one of them)..markets don't like that**

No matter how you slice it, DeepSeek has provided true software driven advances that more efficiently use Nvidia GPUs and non-NVDA GPUs on the training and particularly inference level. You can look at the cost per inference token for DeepSeek vs. OpenAI. It has raised questions on the sustainability on needing cutting edge chips at high margins in the long run. Risks below.

* **Do closed loop models even have a moat over open source?**: Can closed-loop/proprietary LLMs develop models that demand a strong ROI justifying investment in more chips to **train** better models that **end users are willing to pay for**? Currently Sam Altman & Dario (Antropic) think compute is the way to go. However, at some point they could discover more compute for training =/= better or more efficient models.
* **Training:** Efficiencies in hardware utilization may reduce Nvidia's moat in interconnectivity and lead to better training advances, which could reduce margins if other chips are ""somewhat as good"" eventually given demand equalizes to supply. See point # 1 in this excellent recap here  (available by searching DeepSeek and the ramification on the AI industry: winners and losers? by Rihard Jarc)
* **More use cases in a post training world could mean more inference on custom chips & competitor products:** It is widely believed that Nvidia is more of an undisputed leader in training performance vs. inference. If open source models become good enough and training investments do not result in monetizable ROI, Nvidia's margins likely fall as custom chips and other semiconductor players provide good solutions. [Jevon's Paradox (more use cases and usage)](https://www.npr.org/sections/planet-money/2025/02/04/g-s1-46018/ai-deepseek-economics-jevons-paradox) is very likely here, but volume would have to increase signficantly to offset margin decreases - a risk that the market doesn't like.
* **CUDA alternatives leads to market share loses?:** CUDA is widely known to be the best option ""coding"" platform to get GPUs to do what you want right now. [However, there are other applications coming out that allow fungible usage of other chips. ](https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/17/nvidia_cuda_moat/#:~:text=If%20you're%20doing%20low,AMD%20hardware%20%E2%80%93%20and%20vice%20versa)This reduces the need to use Nvidia chips and pay such high margins. There's drawbacks to not using CUDA that I'll highlight in section 4.

Sidenote - there is an honest and excellent podcast on DeepSeek implications to Nvidia from Bankless w/ Jeffrey Emmanuel (whose blogpost got a lot of investors interested in DeepSeek impact over 2 weekends ago). Please listen.

**(4) However, uncertainity is an opportunity if Nvidia can deliver again - remember stocks climb a wall of worry.**

* **Early innings of the AI story:** Models are going to get more complex not stagnate. This requires more training compute as we try to reach AGI level models. On the inference front, as more use cases explode, there will be more general chip demand. We haven't even seen full released use cases in robotics, autonomous transit, healthcare AI, etc.
* **CUDA is the lowest latency** and provides best performance as of now. There might be a technical limit to how well alternatives perform.
* **Cost of being last** in AI is too great for hyperscalers
* **Continued innovation leadership:** Nvidia has expedited it's semiconductor cycle from 2 years to 1 year. Rubin (next gen AI chips) are already being worked on. Semiconductors are known to be cylical, but this may dull any trough cycle.
* **Increased soverign AI investments** (StarGate, Middle east, etc.)
* **Ridiculous cash flow with minimal R&D** as % of revenue means that Nvidia can invest in strategic ventures, emerging tech, and adjacent spaces to diversify revenue streams. Not sure this is proven out in the financials yet, but could in the future.
* **Hopefully - reduced interest rates boosts stock valuations**.

I've included a screenshot of interviews by Rihard Jarc with a former AMD employee on CUDA and training needs going forward after DeepSeek.",66,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iihlgz/thinking_about_nvda_beyond_2025_hyperscaler_capex/
2025-02-05 16:06:28,Alphabet,GOOGL,"Google opens its most powerful AI models to everyone, the next stage in its virtual agent push","Google on Wednesday released Gemini 2.0 — its “most capable” artificial intelligence model suite yet — to everyone.

In December, the company gave access to developers and trusted testers, as well as wrapping some features into Google products, but this is a “general release,” according to Google.

The suite of models includes 2.0 Flash, which is billed as a “workhorse model, optimal for high-volume, high-frequency tasks at scale”; 2.0 Pro Experimental, which is largely focused on coding performance; and 2.0 Flash-Lite, which Google bills as its “most cost-efficient model yet.”

Gemini Flash costs developers 10 cents per million tokens for text, image and video inputs, while Flash-Lite, its more cost-effective version, costs .75 of a cent for the same.

The continued releases are part of a broader strategy for Google of investing heavily into “AI agents” as the AI arms race heats up among tech giants and startups alike.

Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, OpenAI and Anthropic are also moving toward agentic AI, or models that can complete complex multi-step tasks on a user’s behalf, rather than a user having to walk them through every individual step.

“Over the last year, we have been investing in developing more agentic models, meaning they can understand more about the world around you, think multiple steps ahead, and take action on your behalf, with your supervision,” Google wrote in a December blog post, adding that Gemini 2.0 has “new advances in multimodality — like native image and audio output — and native tool use,” and that the family of models “will enable us to build new AI agents that bring us closer to our vision of a universal assistant.”

Anthropic, the Amazon-backed AI startup founded by ex-OpenAI research executives, is a key competitor in the race to develop AI agents. In October, the startup said that its AI agents were able to use computers like humans to complete complex tasks. Anthropic’s computer use capability allows its technology to interpret what’s on a computer screen, select buttons, enter text, navigate websites and execute tasks through any software and real-time internet browsing, the startup said.

The tool can “use computers in basically the same way that we do,” Jared Kaplan, Anthropic’s chief science officer, told CNBC in an interview at the time. He said it can do tasks with “tens or even hundreds of steps.”

OpenAI released a similar tool recently, introducing a feature called Operator that will automate tasks such as planning vacations, filling out forms, making restaurant reservations and ordering groceries. The Microsoft-backed startup described Operator as “an agent that can go to the web to perform tasks for you.”

Earlier this week, OpenAI announced another tool called Deep Research that allows an AI agent to compile complex research reports and analyze questions and topics of the user’s choice. Google in December launched a similar tool of the same name — Deep Research — which acts as a “research assistant, exploring complex topics and compiling reports on your behalf.”

CNBC first reported in December that Google would introduce several AI features early in 2025.

“In history, you don’t always need to be first but you have to execute well and really be the best in class as a product,” CEO Sundar Pichai said in a strategy meeting at the time. “I think that’s what 2025 is all about.”

2025-02-05 15:30:33,Alphabet,GOOGL,"China considers probe into Apple's policies and App Store fees, Bloomberg News reports","China's antitrust regulator is preparing for a possible investigation into Apple's policies and App Store fees, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The development comes a day after China announced measures targeting U.S. businesses including Google, farm equipment makers and the owner of fashion brand Calvin Klein, minutes after new U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods took effect.

The country's State Administration for Market Regulation is reviewing Apple's policies, including its commission of up to 30% on in-app purchases and restrictions on external payment services and App Stores, the report said.

Shares of Apple were down 2.6% in U.S. premarket trading.

Chinese regulators have been in discussions with Apple executives and app developers since last year, as per the report.

Apple and China's antitrust regulator did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.

The regulator said on Tuesday that Google was suspected of violating the country's anti-monopoly law. It did not provide further details on the investigation or on what it alleged Google had done to breach the law.

On Tuesday, Tsinghua University professor Zhang Chenying wrote in an article published in the state-owned People's Daily newspaper that the probe may be related to Google's Android operating system business.

Google had used its dominant position to impose restrictions and constraints on Chinese mobile phone manufacturers in terms of technology and business, she said without detailing where she had obtained the information from.

Separately, China's Commerce Ministry said it had put PVH Corp, the holding company for brands including Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and U.S. biotechnology firm Illumina on its ""unreliable entity"" list.

2025-02-05 15:29:20,Alphabet,GOOGL,Meta going to surpass GOOG in market cap by EOY even though it makes no sense,"Given current trajectories in both share price and valuation, i think META will pass GOOG in market cap by EOY or mid 2026.

I'm trying to rationalize it to myself but I can't - META doesn't even make 70% as much money (net income, if we go by revenue its about 55-65%) as GOOG and their ad business is like 2/3 the size (again, going off net income).  
  
Meta makes 98% of revenues from Ads, Google made around 73% last quarter. I understand that Meta is growing faster, but its advertising business is still not even 2/3 the size of Google and they have 0 diversification outside of ads, so i don't quite understand how meta is poised to surpass google despite being a smaller player in the advertising market and also being a one trick pony.

The key difference with these two stocks imo is that GOOG trades at a discount with the p/e in terminal decline since 2022 (its at 21 today and has been monotonically decreasing for almost 3 years now), while Meta enjoys a valuation expansion on top of its increasing earnings (goog increases earnings but valuation keeps contracting).

The stock market is about telling a story. The story around Google has been completely shit for three years now (AI is eating their lunch despite net income over $100b in 2024 - more than Apple and every other company on the market!) and I don't see what will cause that narrative to improve. In fact it will probably get worse. I can see Google tripling profits between now and 2030 while the p/e is cut in half, tbh

 
Imagine telling a Google bear on the eve of November 2022 after the release of ChatGPT that Google will make 100b in net income in 2024. They'd laugh in your face - search will be obsolete by then. The jury is out on this one, generative AI is not taking marker share and not causing a growth slowdown.

We've been asking this question for almost 3 years now, the answer has remained the same, yet bears keep on thinking that will change. When do you bears lose credibility? We've been hearing about the demise of Search for almost 30 months. At what point do you just admit that you're wrong and realize that LLM is orthogonal to search?
what are peoples thoughts?


EDIT:

A commentor posted this:
""google will never have half the PE of now, it cannot trade at average SPY PE, it has too much moat to be valued like any other SPY company""

Yet look at the facts today:

Current p/e ratio of the SPY: 27.71
current p/e ratio of GOOG: 21 - so google already trades at a STEEP discount to the market. I'm looking at the P/E chart and it seems that the discount is poised to just get worse over time? Pull up the chart of GOOG P/E over time, its in terminal decline for years now. It started the decade around ~30, halfway through the decade in 2025 its at ~21, it will be 10-15 by end of the decade at this rate

**Ticker:** [**AMD (Advanced Micro Devices)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMD&p=d)

**Catalyst:** AMD reported EPS of $0.29 vs. $0.41 expected. Revenue of $7.66 billion vs. $7.5 billion expected. Ultimately said that data center segment revw will be down in Q1, but had clear positive outlook in 2025 and expected double digit revenue growth. This was what caused the stock to fall despite the initial spike.

**Technicals:** Watching $100 level, but doesn't seem to be an irrational move in my opinion. Note that we've moved from $150 to $107 in the past 3 months.

**Risks:** The vast majority of NVDA/AMD/every semiconductor's business's money comes from selling to businesses- individual consumers are a tiny slice of the pie despite gaming/client businesses growing, so I don't really pay attention to them (one exception is NVDA'S 50 series GPUs selling out within 5 minutes) . We also have threats from NVDA dominance, possible regulations from the US, etc, (Disclaimer: I generally don't invest in AMD)

**Catalyst:** GOOG/GOOGL reported fourth-quarter 2024 earnings with an EPS of $2.12 vs. $2.12 expected. Revenue of $96.5 billion vs. $96.67 billion expected. Cited FAR more spending in CapEx and a miss in cloud revenue (which signals that other competitors have taken their market share)

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Market had a pretty negative reaction to the news that they'd be investing far more in capex and missed on cloud revenue (was roughly $9B vs $12B expected).

**Risks:** Elevated capital spending may pressure Alphabet's margins if the capex spending doesn't result in increased revenue, especially amidst increasing competition in the AI and cloud markets. I don't really see the China investigation to affect their stock price much, Google Search and Youtube are blocked in China and I doubt that China is going to let Waymo operate in their cities rather than creating their own solution.

**Ticker:** [**UPS (United Parcel Service)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UPS&p=d)**,** [**FDX (FedEx Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FDX&p=d)**,** [**PDD (Pinduoduo Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PDD&p=d)

**Catalyst:** The U.S. Postal Service has suspended accepting parcels from China and Hong Kong following new tariffs imposed by Trump, affecting logistics companies like UPS and FedEx.

**Technicals:** I'm mainly interested in PDD because they own Temu, which focuses on shipping small/low-cost goods to the US and using the loophole for very low shipping costs.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The recent suspension by USPS may lead to increased demand for private carriers like UPS and FedEx to handle parcels from China. There are a number of Chinese companies that focus on shipping low cost goods (like PDD).

**Risks:** Heightened tariffs and trade barriers could disrupt supply chains, increase costs, and lead to potential overreliance on private carriers, which may face capacity constraints and regulatory scrutiny.

**Ticker:** [**UBER (Uber Technologies)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UBER&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Uber reported fourth-quarter 2024 earnings with an EPS of $3.21 vs. $0.48 expected. Revenue of $12B vs. $11.8B expected. Cited that they plan to do buybacks of their own stock.

**Technicals:** Watching $60 level, no bias.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Despite Uber's strong quarterly performance, they cited a potential $1 billion impact from a strong U.S. dollar on future bookings which results in worse earnings overseas.

**Risks:** Outside of self-driving cars (Uber partnered with Waymo to operate in Austin), currency fluctuations and international markets affect companies you wouldn't normally expect. This may move in future from tariff news.

**Catalyst:** Trump announced that the United States plans to take over the Gaza Strip, relocate its residents to neighboring countries, and redevelop the area.

**Technicals:** USO didn't move much on this piece of news, but if Trump actually makes this a policy then we might see a LOT more volatility in the future depending on how serious we get and if we get involved again.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The oil sector is sensitive to geopolitical developments in the Middle East, a region critical to global oil supply. Initial market reactions to Trump's Gaza proposal didn't impact oil prices. Not really a catalyst TODAY but worth thinking about in the future.

**Risks:** Potential escalation of regional tensions could disrupt oil production or transportation, leading to supply constraints and increased volatility in oil prices.

2025-02-05 13:54:40,Alphabet,GOOGL,Waymo just popped up on the Uber app in Austin ahead of robotaxi launch,"Uber customers in Austin may notice a new offer when they open the app and hail a ride: an invitation to signal their interest in a Waymo robotaxi.

For now, this doesn’t translate into a Waymo picking them up. But it will soon.

The “interest list,” which launched Wednesday, is part of a partnership between Uber and Waymo to operate a robotaxi service in Austin and Atlanta in early 2025. The service is expected to begin soon in Austin, although neither company would share an official start date. A new co-branded robotaxi was also revealed Wednesday.

The “Waymo on Uber” robotaxi service is the latest example of Uber’s push back into autonomous vehicles. Uber divested of its own autonomous vehicle subsidiary, known as Uber ATG, through a complex deal with Aurora in December 2020. Prior to that, ironically, Uber and Waymo were arch rivals, going head-to-head in lawsuits alleging Uber stole trade secrets belonging to Waymo (which at the time was part of Google/Alphabet, which today remains a majority-shareholder) — Uber eventually settled the suits.

Uber has spent the past couple of years shoring up its position in the emerging robotaxi market. The company has partnered with 14 autonomous vehicle companies that cover ride-hailing, delivery, and trucking — a handful of which are operating commercially. In December, Uber launched robotaxi rides with WeRide in Abu Dhabi and Waymo’s autonomous vehicles have been available on the Uber app in Phoenix since October 2023.

2025-02-05 02:29:16,Alphabet,GOOGL,Big tech CapEx: 2024 vs. 2025 and increase in AI server demand,"
AI infrastructure spending is accelerating faster than expected, with Microsoft, Google, and Meta massively increasing their CapEx in 2025 to keep up with AI demand.

CapEx Comparison: 2024 vs. 2025:

- MSFT: 55.7B in 2024 to 80B in 2025
- Google: 52.5B in 2024 to 75B in 2025
- Meta: 39B in 2024 to 60B in 2025

AI servers remain bottlenecked. Microsoft & Google can’t build AI data centers fast enough. That's why they couldn't beat expectations in cloud sales this quarter.

CapEx is being funneled into GPUs, networking, and AI-specific chips. This should make NVIDIA the biggest winner of this trend.

Also, OpenAI just introduced a new ""Deep Research"" AI model, designed for long-context reasoning. This will require even more compute power, further straining existing AI infrastructure. More power demand = more GPUs, networking gear, and data centers.

As long as AI models grow in complexity and scale, NVIDIA and AI infrastructure players should benefit. 

Even if Deepseek story was accurate, optimized model like Deepseek's will drive more demand, which will need even more powerful servers.

All the cases for yet another great year for chip makers especially NVIDIA, don't you think?",38,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ihzo1s/big_tech_capex_2024_vs_2025_and_increase_in_ai/

This is a 31.1 percent increase over earnings of $1.64 per share from the same period last year. The company reported quarterly sales of $96.469 billion which missed the analyst consensus estimate of $96.649 billion by 0.19 percent.

2025-02-04 18:19:20,Alphabet,GOOGL,Apple launches app for party invitations in recurring revenue push,"Apple on Tuesday released a new app for creating invitations and sending them to contacts. The app is called Apple Invites.

Users can create events, such as birthdays, graduations and housewarming parties, and manage RSVPs and guest lists through the app. Apple Invites is also available on the web.

While users won’t need an iPhone to RSVP to events, they will need a paid iCloud+ subscription to send invites.

The launch is the latest example of Apple’s services strategy, whe company introduces new paid subscriptions that are marketed to its installed base of 2.35 billion active devices. Apple’s Services division has become the company’s second largest business behind the iPhone, reporting $25 billion in sales in the December quarter.

Services has also become a big source of Apple’s profit, with a gross margin of 74%. The growth of Apple’s services division is helping Apple’s overall margins expand in recent quarters after years of staying flat. Apple’s services business also includes its search deal with Google, Apple Pay payments and device warranties.

With Invites, Apple is taking on Partiful, a startup founded in 2020 that allows users to make and send event invites. Partiful did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

An iCloud+ subscription starts at $1 per month for 50GB of storage, and it’s included in Apple’s other subscription bundles, ranging up to a $38-per-month subscription that also includes the company’s TV service, Apple Music and access to games, fitness classes and news.

Invites also includes Apple Intelligence, the company’s suite of artificial intelligence software. Apple Intelligence can generate images for invites and help write the invitation with the company’s Writing Tools. Apple Intelligence also has the ability to share a photo album or playlist with an event’s guest list.

While Apple doesn’t charge individually for many of its iCloud+ services, it now has a host of paid features intended to get users to upgrade from free storage. That subscription service offers a VPN-style relay service for private browsing, custom email domains for iCloud, local security camera storage and the ability to generate burner emails.

Apple doesn’t disclose how many iCloud+ subscribers it has. The company last week said that it has 1 billion subscribers, but that figure includes subscriptions to apps through the App Store in addition to its direct iCloud subscriptions.

2025-02-04 14:22:15,Alphabet,GOOGL,These are the stocks on my watchlist (02/4),"This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed!

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments.

The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

Yesterday was eventful, to say the least. Tariffs on Mexico/Canada are delayed, but we still have tariffs on China, and tariffs have been promised by Trump on the EU.

News: [As Trump Tariffs Take Effect, China Retaliates With Trade Measures Against U.S.](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/04/us/trump-tariffs-news?unlocked_article_code=1.uU4.ps2-.DRzgfM1GnN9i)

**Ticker:** [**PLTR (Palantir Technologies Inc)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Reported earnings of $0.14 vs. $0.11 expected. Revenue of $828 million vs. $777 million expected. Management highlighted the power of AI and their sizable contracts, citing the nature of the AI war being winner-take-all.

**Technicals:** PLTR absolutely exploded and hit $102 premarket, currently watching $100 level to see if we continue the move. Other than that unlikely to be trading this unless we have massive volume come in.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The PLTR ER highlighted the growing demand for AI-driven solutions across government/commercial sectors. Company emphasized securing substantial contracts in the competitive AI landscape, important because they are more closely aligned with the current government.

**Risks:** Obviously being more closely tied to the government means that it has more leeway to be more monopolistic/aggresive in their actions, Alex Karp and Peter Thiel are closely aligned with current government leaders.

**Related Tickers:** MSFT, GOOGL, IBM, AMZN

**Ticker:** [**NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Chinese AI company DeepSeek is reportedly preparing to switch to domestic GPUs to circumvent NVDA chip restrictions. DeepSeek has bypassed NVDA CUDA for certain operations, utilizing the PTX (Parallel Thread Execution) language instead. Additionally, on February 2nd, DeepSeek, in collaboration with SiliconFlow and Huawei Cloud, launched DeepSeek-R1/V3 inference services on Huawei's Ascend AI chips. Huawei is also promoting its new Ascend AI processors to Chinese groups considering ""inference"" as an option.

**Technicals:** After the insane move we've seen from $150 to $118, I actually don't consider this to be earth shattering news- China has always been trying to develop their own semis and not using NVDA for training is what they were ""supposed"" to be doing due to the trade restrictions. I'm still long but selling calls against my position, recovery might be slow for NVDA. It's interesting that they are attempting to bypass CUDA, which is essentially the ""standard"" for ML/AI training nowadays on NVDA chips and developing their own.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** DeepSeek's move to adopt domestic GPUs and bypass CUDA indicates they're aiming for technological self-reliance amidst U.S. export restrictions, rather than trying to adopt more NVDA chips (which presumably isn't a viable long term strategy).

**Risks:** Nvidia faces potential revenue loss if Chinese companies increasingly adopt domestic GPUs and alternative programming frameworks. The effectiveness of U.S. export controls may be undermined as Chinese firms develop workarounds.

**Ticker:** [**BABA**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d)**/(oil stocks, car stocks, etc).**

**Catalyst:** U.S. implemented a 10% tariff on all Chinese imports, aiming to address issues related to drug trafficking, particularly fentanyl. In response, China announced retaliatory tariffs effective February 10, including a 15% tariff on U.S. coal and liquefied natural gas, and a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery, and large-engine vehicles.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The imposition of these tariffs marks a significant escalation in U.S.-China trade tension and more volatility to come through Trump tweets- we might see a trade war again (sigh) like we did in 2019. Not 100% sure if agricultural machinery will affect stocks like DE but will look into it.

**Related Tickers:** JD, BIDU, TCEHY, PDD

**Offhand Comments:** There are going to be retaliation investigations against companies operating in America, INTC and GOOG have recently been announced as under investigation by China. But it's very important to remember which companies have a presence in China and which don't- for example, GOOG search hasn't worked in China since 2010 lol.

**Ticker:** [**GRAB (Grab Holdings Limited)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GRAB&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Grab Holdings Ltd. is considering a takeover of its Indonesian rival, GoTo Group, at a valuation of approximately $7 billion.

**Technicals:** Watching $5 level, no bias. I'm not 100% sure if there's an actual ""acquisition"" share price for GoTo but will keep eyes peeled for that acquisition premium.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The potential merger represents a significant consolidation in SEA's ride-hailing and food delivery sectors. Mergers typically streamline operations and reduce competition, leading to improved profitability for the combined entity.

**Risks:** The proposed merger may face regulatory hurdles, including antitrust concerns, which could delay or derail the deal. Standard M&A obstacles.

2025-01-31 19:11:51,Alphabet,GOOGL,"PSA: Tesla's Market Cap is now higher than the top 10 non Chinese car companies, the top solar companies, and Uber all combined","*(I own no shares in any company listed below and I don't own any shorts on Tesla and have no intention on buying any. Just trying to inform people)*

There is no world where this speculation is realized.

* Toyota: 251 B

* Porchse: 56 B
* Mercedez: 59 B
* GM: 56 B

* Jinko 1 B
* Shoals 0.7 B
* Solar Edge 0.7 B
* Canadian Solar: 0.6 B
* Sunnova: 0.3 B
* Uber: 142 B

All combined = $1.117 trillion

* Tesla: 1.3 Trillion

You could Throw in Cisco which has a monopoly over and controls about 66% of the cell phone networking hardware industry in American and it will still be roughly the same. By the way many of the companies on this long list have profit margins and growths that over the last year blow Tesla out of the water. Tesla is not outpacing other companies, other companies are actually catching up to them in the ways they have been growing.

Also, keep in mind that Musk just pissed off about 50 million democrats who were Tesla's existing core customer base. Multiple people at my work who own Tesla's have said they are now embarrassed to own a Tesla.

The speculation is partly based on Tesla's currently nonexistent and delayed automated taxi company. Let's put how weak Tesla's position in perspective.

Tesla plans to open an automated taxi company in Austin Texas this summer. 1 city.  Waymo (owned by Google) started in it's first city 8 years ago and is planning on expanding from 3 cities (San Fransisco, LA, and Pheonix) to 12 over the next year. Tesla is almost a decade behind in this industry and are not in a good position to dominate it or reach fully non city dependent fully automated driving in any way. There is also absolutely no indication that their business model is in a better position than their competitors in this industry currently.

For this current Market cap to be realized, Tesla would essentially need to come to control the majority of 3 major industries while Musk is sitting around playing video games for 12 hours a day (according to him) and playing politician in the Trump administration.",855,286,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iemmrp/psa_teslas_market_cap_is_now_higher_than_the_top/

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2025-01-30 21:50:21,Alphabet,GOOGL,"Google offering ‘voluntary exit’ for employees working on Pixel, Android","Jan 30 2025 - 10:02 am PT

Last year, the teams responsible for Pixel hardware and Android software were merged into one division, and Google today announced a “voluntary exit program” for employees working in the Platforms & Devices group.

SVP Rick Osterloh sent out a memo to employees this morning about the “voluntary exit program,” and the company confirmed to 9to5Google that this is happening.

This program applies to US employees working on Platforms & Devices, which includes Android (Auto, TV, Wear OS, XR), Chrome, ChromeOS, Google Photos, Google One, Pixel, Fitbit, and Nest. Google has many people around the world working on these products, but today’s announcement is just for those stateside.

Meanwhile, this is not a company-wide offer that applies to Search, AI, or other groups, though Alphabet’s new CFO last October said “driving further efficiencies” was a key priority.

Separately, software and hardware were already two very large organizations, with some overlap. Now that things have settled in recent months, employees have a better idea of their roles. Osterloh said the division received questions about the possibility of voluntary exits since the Pixel-Android merger. Not offering people the option to leave in advance was a complaint about how Google handled past layoffs.

The memo frames this exit program as being beneficial for those who might not be aligned or passionate about the combined organization’s mission or are having difficulty with their roles, and hybrid working requirements. 

In leaving Google, employees will get a severance package, with more details internally coming soon. From what we learned, this program does not coincide with any product roadmap changes. 

Before the merger, the Google hardware division last January switched to a functional organization model where there is one team (and leader) for teams like hardware engineering across Pixel, Nest, and Fitbit. At the same time, a few hundred roles were cut. The broader unification in April was designed to “speed up decision-making” internally. 

In offering this program today, Google wants employees “to be deeply committed to our mission and focused on building great products, with speed and efficiency.” The statement also makes reference to “tremendous momentum” and “so much important work ahead.” Google’s full statement is below.

> The Platforms & Devices team is offering a voluntary exit program that provides US-based Googlers working on this team the ability to voluntarily leave the company with a severance package. This comes after we brought two large organizations together last year. There’s tremendous momentum on this team and with so much important work ahead, we want everyone to be deeply committed to our mission and focused on building great products, with speed and efficiency.

2025-01-29 03:21:57,Alphabet,GOOGL,Apple and SpaceX Link Up to Support Starlink Satellite Network on iPhones,"**Thoughts:** Obviously good for companies that are involved in the sat comm business (but may be bad/neutral for sat comm companies that do not work with AAPL such as GSAT), TMUS, and AAPL. TSLA is also possibly affected because SpaceX trades as a proxy to TSLA news. VZ/T/other phone providers may be affected but the use case is so niche that I won't hold my breath. 

>Apple Inc. has been secretly working with SpaceX and T-Mobile US Inc. to add support for the Starlink network in its latest iPhone software, providing an alternative to the company’s in-house satellite-communication service.

>

>The companies have been testing iPhones with the Starlink service from Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp., according to people with knowledge of the matter. In an under-the-radar move, the smartphone’s latest software update — released Monday — now supports the technology.

>

>The tie-up comes as a surprise: T-Mobile has previously only specified Starlink as an option for Samsung Electronics Co. phones, such as the Z Fold and S24 models. Apple, meanwhile, already provides a Globalstar Inc. offering that lets consumers send texts and contact emergency responders when out of cellular range.

>

>T-Mobile has begun allowing customers to sign up for an early version of the Starlink service, and this week the carrier enabled a small number of iPhones as part of a beta test.

>

>The first users received text messages from T-Mobile saying, “You’re in the T-Mobile Starlink beta. You can now stay connected with texting via satellite from virtually anywhere. To start experiencing coverage beyond, please update to iOS 18.3.” Users in the program have a new toggle switch in their iPhone cellular data settings to manage the satellite feature.

>

>An Apple spokesperson declined to comment, while T-Mobile said that the test will “begin with select optimized smartphones” and that the full launch will “support the vast majority of modern smartphones.” T-Mobile has also opened the beta to some users running Android 15, the latest version of the Google operating system. A representative for SpaceX didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

>

>Ever since Apple teamed up with Globalstar to offer satellite features in 2022, there’s been speculation over whether it might support competing networks. The day after Apple’s 2022 announcement, Musk posted on X that his company has “had some promising conversations with Apple about Starlink connectivity.”

>

>Here’s how it will work: When a T-Mobile iPhone is in an area without cellular connectivity, devices that are part of the Starlink program will first try to pair with SpaceX satellites. Users will also be able to enable texting via the satellite menu for the Globalstar service or contact emergency services through Apple.

>

>The initial version of Starlink is exclusively for texting. But SpaceX and T-Mobile have said that they plan to expand into data connections and voice calls in the future. The program also is only available in the US for now. That contrasts with Apple’s Globalstar service, which works in several countries. SpaceX is looking to expand Starlink to other carriers globally.

>

>There’s another major difference between the two services. The current Apple feature requires users to point their iPhone to the sky to find a satellite. The Starlink option, meanwhile, is designed to work automatically — even when the phone is in a customer’s pocket.

>

>Both the Starlink and Apple satellite features are designed to work in off-the-grid areas, such as hiking trails, that don’t have cellular service. The capabilities can’t be used in places where a mobile-phone network is within reach. Support for the Apple feature is available on most current iPhone models and the company plans to bring it to its Ultra smartwatch later this year, Bloomberg News has reported.

>

>T-Mobile updated its website this week to tell beta testers that the iPhone is supported as part of the iOS 18.3 software release. As of now, the number of users in the beta is minimal, with T-Mobile planning to expand the program in February. Apple’s announcement of iOS 18.3 touted AI features and bug fixes, but it didn’t disclose the Starlink support.

>

>SpaceX requested authority to begin beta-testing the service starting Monday. The Federal Communications Commission granted SpaceX conditional approval for its satellites to supplement T-Mobile’s cellular network in November.

however, its still using NVDA chips. it doesnt hurt NVDA at all. they can literally restrict supply chain. or just only continue to produce expensive flagships.

if Deepseeks tech caused companys that are also developing AI, such as Google, Open AI, MSFT, etc, that can somewhat make sense.

but i dont understand the hit on the company's thats designing/making the chips.

  
at the end of the day, they are still going to, and have to , rely on NVDA and TSM.

  
so why does this have an impact on NVDA?",2,97,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ibx21s/i_dont_understand_the_reasoning_of_deepseek/

**Mag 7 Winners**

* Apple: This is where their lag in AI investment actually helps them. Now they can build better AI for their mobile devices, computers, home services, and their version of Omniverse at a much lower cost. 

* Google, which invested in their own cheaper chips instead of the Nvidia chips. Also has the most integrated AI stack which means they have more ability to adapt. 
* Amazon, same as Google but to a lesser degree.

**Financial**

* Cheaper model training cost means a lot more startups will gain meaningful access to AI, creating a lot more exciting use cases. More startup success means more M&A.

**Software**

* Cheaper model training cost also means the cost of companies running AI agents/software will also pay a lot less. They can pass on savings to customers, invest even more into R&D, and accelerate their agentic AI.

* Some picks off top of my head: Salesforce, cyber security stocks like PANW or Crowdstrike, Palantir, or just $IGV. 

**Healthcare / Drug Development**

* There should be less demand for Nvidia chips, making it cheaper for these industries to gain more (and cheaper) access to GPU.

2025-01-26 18:27:18,Alphabet,GOOGL,"Apple Remains a Threat in AR, Even as Meta and Google Race Ahead",">Meta and Google have jumped out ahead in the race to make augmented reality glasses for consumers, but Apple remains a looming threat. Also: The iPhone maker brings in a fixer for its Siri and AI efforts, and the company has a decision to make about its longtime chairman. Samsung, meanwhile, just unveiled impressive new AI features and is poised to beat Apple to market with a skinny smartphone.

>A decade ago, it began developing AR technology for its now-defunct attempt to build a self-driving vehicle. The idea: a windshield that could overlay navigation information, traffic alerts, camera feeds and other data while the car drove around town on its own. Apple even built a simulator of the concept at its Silicon Valley offices and managed to turn the idea into a working prototype that showed promise to executives.

>But the company quickly realized that this Minority Report-like experience would be too power-hungry and expensive to put inside of a vehicle. So it turned its attention to headsets, which can provide the same data in a smaller package. A person in the car could simply wear some headgear instead of needing to have the technology built into the windshield.

>The car glasses idea didn’t get too far either. But Apple’s vehicle group poured resources into developing AR displays and used virtual reality goggles to demonstrate the car’s capabilities. That ultimately led to Apple’s work on a consumer headset.

>At the time, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook felt that VR goggles were too isolating. He preferred AR, which keeps users in the real world while superimposing data on their field of vision. But it was also clear that the true AR dream — a lightweight pair of glasses that customers could wear all day — was still far off.

>That’s about the time when Mike Rockwell stepped in. That executive, who currently oversees Apple’s Vision Pro division, moved the AR and VR efforts into a team that was separate from the car unit. Rockwell and his staff spent the better part of two years creating a headset prototype that melded VR and AR into an approach that Apple eventually called spatial computing.

>This was the great compromise: Users weren’t truly seeing the real world around them, but the device’s pass-through cameras made it feel like they were. The project was greenlit, and the company eventually spent billions of dollars to develop the device — all while continuing to work on making true AR glasses a reality. That led to the release of the Vision Pro mixed-reality headset a year ago.

>Apple had originally hoped to release AR spectacles as a follow-up to the Vision Pro, but the technical challenges were just too great. Such a product remains far away, and the company is still tinkering with the underlying technologies.

>At the same time, rivals like Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google have jumped ahead in the AR race. Meta showed off a prototype of augmented reality glasses last year, and Google is working with Samsung Electronics Co. on their own next-generation devices. Meta also has had success with its Ray-Ban smart glasses, which don’t have a display but can handle tasks like recording video and making phone calls.

>The Vision Pro, meanwhile, has largely been a flop, hurt by its cumbersome design and $3,500 price tag. That said, it’s hard to discount Apple’s innovation abilities. Work on the AR screens remains ongoing at a secretive facility in Santa Clara, California, one town over from the company’s home base in Cupertino.

>Though there were layoffs at the site last year — when Apple scrapped plans for in-house smartwatch displays — the company kept some employees around to work on AR technology, along with a manufacturing facility to develop and test future screens.

>Tepid demand for the Vision Pro has only made Apple more certain that AR glasses are a superior format. But the executives involved in the effort don’t think a product will be ready for three years or more. In the meantime, Apple expects to release other devices in the style of Vision Pro that it hopes will be cheaper and more enticing to consumers.

>While it develops the AR technology for future devices, the company is conducting user studies at its offices to gauge the appeal of features and interfaces. Apple is already working on a version of visionOS — the Vision Pro’s software — that will run on glasses. It’s also exploring other types of wearable products, including a rival to Meta’s Ray-Ban spectacles and even camera-equipped AirPods.

>The question now is whether Apple’s rivals are getting too far ahead. Meta’s AR prototype, called Orion, will set the stage for a consumer product by 2027. And Google’s new Android XR operating system is meant to usher in a wave of headsets and glasses, with Samsung first in line to release devices.

>When I first tested Android XR in December at Google’s headquarters, the company showed me several glasses prototypes — with and without displays. They seemed polished for prototypes, but they won’t hit the market until the display technology improves and costs come down. Another issue to be solved: battery life.

>Meta, Google and Samsung also aren’t slowing down on development of VR and mixed-reality devices. Meta is working on Quest 4 VR goggles, as well as a new high-end model that could eventually become a successor to the Quest Pro mixed-reality headset, I’m told. Samsung, meanwhile, showed off the hardware for its “Moohan” mixed-reality headset during its Unpacked event this past week.

>In interviews, Samsung and Google executives hinted that this headset would be cheaper than the Vision Pro and that it’s on track to debut this year. The companies won’t have to share the spotlight with Apple, which is unlikely to ship any major new head-worn device in 2025.

>But the real showdown will come in the years ahead, when AR glasses are refined enough to serve as a smartphone replacement. You can imagine a future where people use smart spectacles as their primary mobile device and then turn to a mixed-reality or VR headset for gaming or computing tasks. In that vision, head-worn devices will have supplanted both phones and laptops — markets worth hundreds of billions of dollars.

>Given what’s at stake, Apple can’t afford to stay on the sidelines too long. But the company does have a history of swooping into already-established markets and beating competitors with better design and more elegantly integrated hardware and software. The playbook it used so effectively in smartphones and watches could work again.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2025-01-24 04:10:35,Alphabet,GOOGL,Switched from Ameriprise managed account to Fidelity - Sell individual stocks?,"After a year of trying an Ameriprise managed account, I recently moved everything to Fidelity to start managing it myself. They underperformed the S&P500 (before their fee), and almost all positions are just S&P500 companies anyways, so I figured if I went 100% into an S&P index on my own I can't do worse.

I'm not sure how best to proceed with the current number of individual stocks. There are 64 positions total and it's unrealistic that I'll be able to keep track of the performance/trajectory of that many companies. Buffet's ""pick a few winners"" comes to mind. I've been assuming the best thing to do is to slowly liquidate the one's I don't have a specific interest in, and buy VOO/SPY in their place.

There are many companies that I like and would like to hold on to (AAPL, AMD, AMZN, BRKB, GOOGL, JNJ, KO, MSFT, NVDA, NFLX, PG). However, the majority are S&P 500 companies that I don't follow closely (ABT, ADBE, AMAT, AMGN, AMT, AVGO, AZN, BA, BMY, CAT, COP, CRM, CVX, ... to name a few). It's not that I don't know those companies, but it feels ignorant to hold onto them knowing that I won't have time to monitor their performance.

Is there a best way to go about liquidating those and moving into an S&P 500 index? Initial temptation is gambler's fallacy (sell the low performers first and keep the better ones a bit longer).",2,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1i8mzb1/switched_from_ameriprise_managed_account_to/
2025-01-23 12:39:34,Alphabet,GOOGL,Apple and Google's massive mobile empires face dual UK antitrust probes,"Britain’s competition regulator on Thursday launched an investigation into Apple and Google’s huge mobile ecosystems to determine whether the tech titans are in breach of the U.K.’s strict new digital competition rules.

The U.K. Competition and Markets Authority said it was opening dual probes into both U.S. tech giants to assess whether they hold “strategic market status” in their respective mobile ecosystems, including operating systems, app stores and smartphone-based browsers.

The investigations will “explore the impact on people who use mobile devices and the thousands of businesses developing innovative services or content such as apps for these devices,” the CMA said.

“Apple believes in thriving and dynamic markets where innovation can flourish,” an Apple spokesperson told CNBC. “We face competition in every segment and jurisdiction where we operate, and our focus is always the trust of our users.”

“In the U.K. alone, the iOS app economy supports hundreds of thousands of jobs and makes it possible for developers big and small to reach users on a trusted platform,” the Apple spokesperson added. “We will continue to engage constructively with the CMA as their work on this matter progresses.”

Google was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.

New powers

The CMA now has enhanced regulatory powers after a new U.K. law, called the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act, or DMCC, came into effect at the start of this year.

The DMCC seeks to prevent anti-competitive behavior in digital markets. It can designate large companies that have a significant amount of market power in a certain digital activity as having “strategic market status.”

The CMA now has the power to impose changes to prevent potential anti-competitive behavior from any firm that is given strategic market status.

According to the regulator, virtually all mobile devices sold in the U.K. are pre-installed with either Apple’s iOS or Google’s Android operating systems, and their app stores and browsers have either exclusive or leading positions on their platforms compare to alternative products and services.

Almost all (94%) of people aged 16 or above — about 56 million consumers — in the U.K. currently have access to a smartphone and the average Brit spends around three hours a day using a mobile device, the CMA added.

The body said it would examine three key issues, including the extent of competition between Apple and Google’s mobile ecosystems, possible leveraging of the tech giants’ market power into other activities and potential exploitative conduct.

“More competitive mobile ecosystems could foster new innovations and new opportunities across a range of services that millions of people use, be they app stores, browsers or operating systems,” Sarah Cardell, chief executive of the CMA, said in a statement Thursday.

“Better competition could also boost growth here in the UK, with businesses able to offer new and innovative types of products and services on Apple’s and Google’s platforms,” Cardell added.

2025-01-21 21:02:37,Alphabet,GOOGL,"Reddit shares rise 7%, hit record as Raymond James raises price target","Reddit shares rose over 7% to a record high Tuesday after Raymond James analysts raised their price target and reiterated their “strong buy” rating for the social media platform.

The company’s shares reached $191 during midday trading, topping a previous high of $182 on Jan. 6. Reddit shares passed $100 for the first time in late October after the company reported third-quarter financial results that beat Wall Street expectations.

Raymond James analysts said in a Tuesday note that they would raise their Reddit price target to $200 from $150, largely due to their “conviction” that Reddit can expand its business internationally.

The company is planning to attract more users outside its core U.S. market as it looks to expand its advertising business, Reddit Chief Operating Officer Jen Wong told CNBC in November. Reddit’s third-quarter sales, which are predominantly online advertising, rose 68% year-over-year to $348.4 million.

Reddit’s increase use of artificial intelligence to automatically translate its site text to different languages like Portuguese, French, Spanish, Philippines and German “should help improve local search rankings for Reddit and provide durable hypergrowth,” the Raymond James analysts wrote.

The company’s AI-translation efforts are key to its international expansion, Wong told CNBC in November. Reddit’s fastest-growing regions in regards to users include the U.K., the Philippines, India and Brazil, she said.

“That points to a lot of our future user growth opportunity definitely outside of the U.S. and local language,” Wong said. “Every language is an opportunity for another Reddit.”

The company also continues to be one of the top five most searched websites, the Raymond James analysts said, citing the SimilarWeb research firm. Reddit’s “authentic and uniquely moderated (community system) content” will help the company stay on top of search results, ultimately resulting in more Reddit users creating accounts, the analysts wrote.

Reddit makes more money on logged-in users who have accounts rather than logged-out users, who have been visiting the platform more often over the past year due to internal site improvements and a previous Google search algorithm change that favored “authentic” content.

The Raymond James analysts noted in a section on “risks” that Reddit could suffer from “unfavorable Google search algo updates” that push the site lower in search results and slower rates in converting those logged-out users into the more financially lucrative logged-in counterparts.

2025-01-19 19:41:26,Alphabet,GOOGL,"Apple Is Unlikely to Buy Sonos, But Amazon or Spotify Might Consider It",">The woes of speaker maker Sonos have raised the prospect of a takeover, but who might want to buy it? 

>

>For months, Sonos Inc. has been reeling. After a disastrous software rollout last year, the audio technology company that some used to call “the Apple of speakers” remains mired in the biggest crisis in its two-decade history.

>

>It all started in May when the company introduced a revamped app — the software that lets customers control their speakers, soundbars, subwoofers, headphones and other devices. The app was designed to modernize the Sonos experience and lay the groundwork for new types of products, such as the Ace headphones. But it lacked vital features and was hobbled by bugs, turning the simple act of using Sonos equipment into a nightmare.

>

>The missing features — including the sleep timer, advanced music queues, alarms, and functions related to searching and navigating music libraries — have mostly been restored. But users have reported that glitches persist in some cases: Devices don’t pair, audio volume will spike without warning, connections fail, and streaming doesn’t always go smoothly.

>

>Sonos should have never launched the new app the way it did and was aware of many bugs prior to the initial release. It should have kept around the old and reliable S2 app and launched the new version as a beta test. Once the revamped software became as dependable as the old app, Sonos could have moved forward with the new version as the default. Of course, that would have provided less of a splashy marketing opportunity — the chance to flip the switch on a whole new experience.

>

>So here we are. The new app ended up being devastating to employee morale, company revenue and the brand’s reputation. It’s a disaster on par with Apple’s rocky move to its own Maps software from Google in 2012 — a switch that led to the ouster of the company’s software chief. The big difference is that, for Apple, Maps is one app. For Sonos, the change compromised the software underpinning all its products.

>

>Sonos’ board ultimately needed to take action. More than six months after the launch of the app — and even after an apology tour from its executives and a multitude of attempted fixes — the company parted ways with Chief Executive Officer Patrick Spence a week ago. The next day, it also cut loose its chief product officer, who many Sonos employees blamed for the app mess.

>

>In their place is interim CEO Tom Conrad, a co-creator of music streaming service Pandora and former executive at Snap Inc. He has served on the Sonos board since 2017 and was already helping with the app recovery effort. Though the company has vowed to search the globe for a new full-time CEO, many Sonos staffers believe Conrad has the inside track to get the job — if he wants it.

>

>But with Sonos’ market valuation hovering around $1.7 billion — down from more than $5 billion during a pandemic-fueled rally — the board will probably consider whether selling the company makes more sense.

>

>Apple has long been seen as a potential suitor, given the two companies’ similarities. Sonos is focused on premium design with a tightly controlled ecosystem — just like Apple. They share a penchant for audio technology, and their corporate cultures have some overlap.

>

>Apple could snap up Sonos for $2 billion or so — less than it paid for Beats — and it would only cost them a few days’ worth of revenue. Sonos’ hardware could also shore up Apple’s disappointing HomePod and home audio lineup.

>

>But I don’t believe Apple will ever acquire Sonos. If Apple really wanted to build out its home audio business, it already has the hardware, software, content and manufacturing chops internally. It’s just about wanting to get things done properly — something that Apple is already working on. Later this year, it will launch its own home hub and a new HomePod mini.

>

>The only things it would gain from Sonos are a user base, a collection of patents and the employees — none of which Apple needs. Sonos’ software is obviously something Apple wouldn’t want, especially in its current state, and audio hardware has become heavily commoditized.

>

>Other potential suitors, such as Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Microsoft Corp., wouldn’t make much sense either. Meta has all but exited the smart home, choosing to focus on AI and wearables instead. Google has a painful history with Sonos involving patent lawsuits. And Microsoft has increasingly scaled back its interest in non-Xbox hardware in recent years.

>

>Still, there are some major technology companies that might consider the idea. That list includes [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) Inc., Samsung Electronics Co., Roku Inc. and Spotify Technology SA.

>

>Amazon seems like the most natural fit. With former Microsoft Chief Product Officer Panos Panay now leading its hardware efforts, the expectation is that Amazon will revamp its device lineup and shift toward more upscale offerings. Sonos’ speakers already work with the entire streaming music industry and are certainly high-end.

>

>Sonos’ premium technology could be the basis for a series of new Amazon Echo devices running the upcoming AI-infused Alexa digital assistant. It would also help Amazon expand into new areas, such as over-ear headphones and soundbars — two categories the company has explored in the past.

>

>Amazon could certainly afford to buy Sonos, though it would have to overcome regulatory hurdles. Don’t forget: Amazon had to back out of a deal to buy Roomba maker iRobot Corp. after the European Union threatened to block the acquisition.

>

>A European company like Spotify might have an easier time getting a deal cleared. The streaming music service has championed the idea of hardware products that can run services from several different players, which Sonos does well. Spotify has long wanted to get into hardware but struggled to make it happen. Sonos would give them an instant entry, with an excellent range of products that could run its audio services.

>

>Roku is another possibility, though it would probably face antitrust concerns. After all, the company already sells a set of low-end soundbars and TV speakers. If it could make a deal work, Roku would get higher-end products that can potentially command higher profit margins. One caveat: This may need to be a stock-based deal given Roku doesn’t have as much cash on hand as its bigger rivals.

>

>Samsung is a wild card. The company already sells soundbars and subwoofers and even acquired the Harman brand in 2017. But it’s failed to crack the home speaker space. It announced an Echo-like speaker called the Galaxy Home several years ago but never actually brought it to market. Sonos would help it create a more consumer-focused line of home audio gear and provide more modern technology for its home theater products.

>

>For consumers, the best scenario is probably Sonos figuring things out and remaining independent — the current goal of the company. With the world’s biggest tech giants expanding into every facet of our lives, there is something appealing about an independent brand that plays nice with all the platforms. It’s just unclear how long Sonos will be able to do it alone.

>

>Retail inventory of the current iPhone SE quickly shrinks ahead of new model’s debut. One of Apple’s most significant new products this year will be the the iPhone SE’s replacement. The device — codenamed V59 — will mark the beginning of Apple’s transition from Qualcomm Inc. cellular modem chips to silicon designed in-house. It also means the company will no longer sell an iPhone with the now-antiquated home button. The latest model, which will also add Apple Intelligence, is set to launch by the spring — and there are signs Apple is gearing up for the release.

>

>According to people working in Apple’s retail operations, a surprisingly large number of US stores have little to no inventory of the iPhone SE remaining. Consumers can still get the device from the online store — and it ships out within a few days — but finding one at a brick-and-mortar outlet is going to be harder and harder. Apple also has ceased sales of the current SE in the European Union because the device lacks the now-required USB-C port.

>

>The drawing down of inventory is a reliable sign that a new model is coming. But it also suggests that Apple probably won’t keep the current version around — at a reduced price — after the update is here. That seems like a missed opportunity, since a cheap iPhone could’ve helped Apple make inroads in some markets. The current SE costs $429, and the new one might be more than that given its enhanced features.

>

>This new iPhone isn’t the only big product update on the horizon. As I wrote last week, look out for upcoming MacBook Airs with the M4 “Donan” chip, as well as fresh low-end iPads, iPad Airs and new Magic Keyboards in the not-too-distant future.

>

>Apple is bringing AI to Mac Mail app in macOS 15.4, even as it scales back notification summaries in iOS 18.3. The Apple Intelligence rollout is continuing with the release of macOS 15.3 in a few weeks. For the first time, Apple is bringing its Genmoji custom emoji to the Mac — following their debut on the iPhone and iPad. The company will add more features by April with iOS 18.4 and macOS 15.4. The big addition at that time will be the new Siri digital assistant, which will be able to better tap into personal information and use the App Intents technology to more precisely control apps.

>

>But there’s another, more under-the-radar feature coming in April as well: The Mac will get the upgraded Mail app that uses AI to prioritize messages and sort content into different inboxes. Right now, iPad and iPhone users are able to tap into the feature — which is terrific — but Mac customers have been left behind. That changes with macOS 15.4, I’m told. For those not familiar with the feature: It sorts mail into a primary category, as well as ones for transactions, promotions, updates and all mail.

>

>In other Apple Intelligence news, the company is scaling back notification summaries in iOS 18.3 and macOS 15.3. For months, news organizations and users have been complaining about incorrect or misleading notifications from Apple Intelligence. Rather than quickly fixing its AI models, Apple is simply pulling the plug on summaries from news and entertainment apps. You can also more easily disable summaries from the lock screen, and recaps are now italicized.

>

>Apple’s ex-chief people officer lands at HP. It’s not easy to join Apple after a career outside the company. The place is run by big personalities like Tim Cook, Phil Schiller, Greg Joswiak and others who have been there for several decades. In other words, if you’re walking into Apple thinking you’re going to change how it operates, you’re in for a surprise.

>

>That was the case with Carol Surface, who joined Apple in 2023 as chief people officer after working at Medtronic Plc, Best Buy Co. and PepsiCo Inc. She flamed out after less than two years. Stella Low, Apple’s short-lived vice president of communications, ran into similar issues in 2022.

>

>Both women were hired by Cook himself and stayed at Apple for way less time than anticipated, but now they have another thing in common: They landed at HP Inc. afterward. Low joined the computer maker as its chief communications officer in 2022 and recently left. Surface just agreed to join HP and is starting March 24. Given Surface’s successful and varied human resources career prior to Apple, she could end up being a good fit for HP.

>

>Speaking of Apple’s insidery culture: It was no surprise that Surface’s role was ultimately filled by Deirdre O’Brien, her predecessor and a 30-plus-year veteran of the company. Low, meanwhile, was replaced by Kristin Huguet, a member of Apple’s PR department since before the original iPhone went on sale.

>They’re both capable leaders, but Apple will eventually need to figure out how to bring in more talent from the outside. Right now, the company isn’t always built to handle fresh ideas from newcomers. With Apple’s need to innovate and find new sources of revenue, that might be a problem in the not-too-distant future.

>

**The Schedule**

>Jan. 22 — Samsung unveils Galaxy S25 line. Samsung is set to announce its Galaxy S25 smartphone lineup at its Unpacked event this week in San Jose, California. This year’s devices aren’t expected to get a major hardware overhaul, with the company instead focusing more on software and artificial intelligence features. But Samsung aims to show that it has an edge over Apple in this area. Stay tuned for coverage of Unpacked this week, including all of the details of the new devices. And if you’re waiting for news on Samsung smartwatches and foldable phones, those will likely debut later in the year.

>

>Jan. 30 — Apple’s first-quarter results. The earnings report — the first under Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh — will give details of Apple’s all-important holiday season. Investors will get an idea of how the iPhone 16 is selling, as well as updated AirPods and Apple Watches. The company also should provide the first real sense of whether the Apple Intelligence AI platform is spurring consumers to upgrade their devices. Wall Street is looking for about $124 billion in revenue during the period, a 4% gain from a year earlier.

>

>**Post Game Q&A**

>Q: Why is Tim Cook attending the Trump inauguration?

>A: Many Apple employees are none too pleased that their CEO is heading to Washington to kiss the ring and attend Trump’s swearing-in event on Monday. (Cook also personally donated $1 million to the inauguration fund.) The move seems to clash with Apple’s support of diversity, immigration and other progressive causes — ones that Cook himself has championed. But it’s equally clear that Apple may need Trump’s help over the next four years as it contends with tariffs, the Justice Department antitrust case and mounting pressure from the European Union. Cook likely believes Trump can alleviate these problems. He’s also not alone in turning out for the president-elect. Most of the world’s most valuable tech companies are sending a high-profile leader to the event.

>

>Q: When are the new Powerbeats Pro 2 launching?

>A: The latest earbuds from Apple’s Beats subsidiary are due imminently. The new accessory has already been submitted to the Federal Communications Commission and other regulators for approval, and the company is gearing up for a press briefing in a week or so to go over the details of the new product. The upgrades will feature a smaller overall design and improvements like Spatial Audio and enhanced noise cancellation that are already available on AirPods. The programming code within iOS also suggests that these earbuds could be capable of collecting heart-rate data from a wearer. I’ve previously reported that Apple is working on this technology and actively testing it.

>

>Q: Why is Apple starting to use US-made chips?

>A: A major, under-discussed risk facing Apple right now is that practically 100% of its advanced processors are made in Taiwan by partner TSMC. If Taiwan goes down for whatever reason (a political crisis, natural disaster or something else), Apple is in big trouble with no real plan B. That’s why moving more production to other areas is so critical, and such a shift is now underway. TSMC is running test production of lower-end Apple chips at a facility in Arizona, the first step toward more ambitious goals. Over time, Apple hopes to get chips from other factories in the US and elsewhere, including Europe. Let’s face it, the company has been fairly lucky so far that its chip production hasn’t suffered major hiccups. Apple’s reliance on one geographic location for the most important component in its devices has been a major hazard for years.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2025-01-16 22:47:02,Alphabet,GOOGL,Microsoft raises price of consumer version of Microsoft 365 for first time since 2013,"Microsoft is adding artificial intelligence tools to its consumer Microsoft 365 bundle and bumping up the price for the first time since introducing subscriptions 12 years ago.

In a blog post Thursday, Microsoft said it’s bringing its Copilot AI assistant into the Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and OneNote applications for consumers who have the Microsoft 365 suite.

The increase of $3 per month is meant “to reflect the extensive subscription benefits that we’ve added over the past 12 years and enable us to deliver new innovations for years to come,” Bryan Rognier, vice president of Microsoft 365 Consumer, wrote in the post.

Microsoft 365 Personal will now cost $9.99 per month and $99.99 per year, up from $6.99 per month and $69.99 per year. The Microsoft 365 Family plan, which serves up to six people, will cost $12.99 per month and $129.99 per year, up from $9.99 a month and $99.99 per year.

Microsoft had 84.4 million consumer subscribers to Microsoft 365 in the September quarter, up 10%. Existing customers will see the new prices upon renewal, according to the blog post.

Formerly known as Office 365, Microsoft 365 is important to the company’s efforts to compete with Google’s productivity tools in the consumer market. But sales to businesses are far more lucrative for Microsoft.

Microsoft 365 commercial products and cloud services represented 31% of the company’s fiscal third-quarter revenue, while Microsoft 365 consumer products and cloud services contributed less than 3%. In 2022, Microsoft increased prices of commercial Microsoft 365 subscriptions for the first time.

In addition to bringing Copilot into the Microsoft 365 applications, consumer subscribers will gain access to Microsoft Designer, an AI image editing tool.

Microsoft said that, for a limited time, existing subscribers can switch to plans without Copilot or other AI.

“These plans will continue to be maintained as they exist today, but for certain new innovations and features you’ll need a Microsoft 365 Personal and Family subscription,” the company said.

2025-01-16 22:41:16,Alphabet,GOOGL,Snap shares drop as FTC refers MyAI chatbot complaint to the DOJ,"Snap shares closed down 5% on Thursday after the Federal Trade Commission said it would refer a complaint against the company to the Department of Justice.

The FTC’s non-public complaint involves allegations that Snapchat’s My AI chatbot poses “risks and harms to young users,” the commission said in a statement. The complaint stems from the FTC’s compliance reviews with Snap following a 2014 settlement regarding allegations of public deception pertaining to data collection by the company.

As part of the FTC’s compliance reviews of Snap, the agency said it had uncovered the possibility that the company “is violating or is about to violate the law.”

“A proceeding is in the public interest,” the FTC said in its statement.

The FTC did not specify what about the My AI chatbot its complaint was focused on, but the chatbot has previously drawn scrutiny.

A Snap spokesperson pushed back against the FTC’s claims in a statement to CNBC.

“Unfortunately, on the last day of this Administration, a divided FTC decided to vote out a proposed complaint that does not consider any of these efforts, is based on inaccuracies, and lacks concrete evidence,” the Snap spokesperson said. “It also fails to identify any tangible harm and is subject to serious First Amendment concerns.”

The spokesperson added that while the company shares the FTC’s “focus on ensuring the thoughtful development of generative AI,” Snap believes that the “complaint would stifle innovation and competition in a critical and growing sector of the economy.”

Snap debuted the My AI chatbot in 2023. It is powered by the large language models of OpenAI and Google, giving it the ability to answer user questions and provide tips and suggestions similar to ChatGPT and other AI-powered chatting tools.

The chatbot has been noted for providing problematic responses. In one instance while speaking with a reporter who was pretending to be a teenager, the chatbot answered explained how to hide the smell of alcohol and marijuana, The Washington Post reported in 2023. At the time of the chatbot’s initial release, Snap said that My AI, like other AI-powered chatbots, is “prone to hallucination and can be tricked into saying just about anything. Please be aware of its many deficiencies and sorry in advance!”

In Oct. 2013, the United Kingdom’s Information Commissioner’s Office issued a preliminary enforcement notice against Snap, alleging that the company’s My AI-related risk assessment “did not adequately assess the data protection risks posed by the generative AI technology, particularly to children.”

Although the FTC said that it voted during a closed meeting to issue a public statement about it’s case against Snap and its ensuing referral to the DOJ, it noted that FTC commissioners Melissa Holyoak and Andrew Ferguson were absent.

The FTC also pointed to a dissenting statement by Ferguson, who President-elect Donald Trump named in December to replace Lina Khan as the next FTC chair.

Ferguson noted that these kinds of referrals “are not disclosed unless and until the complaint is filed in court by the Department or the Commission.”

“I did not participate in the farcical closed meeting at which this matter was approved,” he wrote.

Ferguson added that he opposes the FTC’s complaint against Snap, but that he can’t “release a detailed analysis of its many problems,” because the case is not public. Ferguson wrote that the complaint’s interpretations of an FTC law is “wrong” and that it is “in direct conflict with the guarantees of the First Amendment.”

If the DOJ files the complaint, Ferguson said he will “release a more detailed statement about this affront to the Constitution and the rule of law.”

There has since been a lot of talk about how Uber is going to get disrupted by robotaxis, Tesla, and google. Luckily, after a streak of bad news uber finally started getting some upgrades and even Announced an accelerated buy back. 

That said, recently there has also been rumors of Lyft getting bought by Amazon. If that were to happen I think it would be be very negative for uber. I am contemplating bailing out here break even as this company seems to be in the crosshairs of potential disruption. As it stands now they are crushing it and in the near term will probably continue to do so.

2025-01-14 20:17:01,Alphabet,GOOGL,The role of ROCm in AMD's future,"I've recently bought some AMD shares because the share price does not seem to reflect the progress they are making on the hardware front.

I'm considering buying more shares but I find it hard to pull the trigger because the adoption of ROCm seems to be lacking.

I've tried to get a sense of ROCm vs. CUDA usage in as many ways as I could find:

\- Google search trends  
\- Github statistics of the official ROCm repository  
\- Github statistics of the TensorFlow and PyTorch library  
\- Package manager statistics of ROCm related packages (including TensorFlow and PyTorch)  
\- Dockerhub statistics of ROCm related images

I understand that these statistics are not going to reflect the reality but they do give an (albeit indirect) sense of the difference in adoption.

It seems that CUDA easily has 10X more usage and activity than ROCm and I currently don't see how AMD is going to be able to turn that around.

If AMD AI related hardware stays on par with Nvidia's counterparts or only slightly outperforms them, there is nearly no incentive for companies to make the switch to ROCm unless they use unforked TensorFlow or PyTorch solutions.

Large companies usually operate on forked versions of these frameworks to suit their own particular needs and are also highly likely to have several projects directly integrating with CUDA which makes the switch to ROCm very costly.

How large a role do you guys think the adoption of ROCm will play in the future of AMD and how do you see AMD incentivizing large companies to make the switch from CUDA?",32,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1i1fe4x/the_role_of_rocm_in_amds_future/
