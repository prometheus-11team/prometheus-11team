“Huawei Technologies is gearing up to test its newest and most powerful artificial-intelligence processor, which the company hopes could replace some higher-end products of U.S. chip giant Nvidia NVDA -3.48%. 

The steady advance by one of China’s flagship technology companies points to the resilience of the country’s semiconductor industry despite efforts by Washington to stymie it, including by cutting off access to some Western chip-making equipment.”

Perhaps Trump’s export ban of NVDA chips to China wasn’t the smartest move?",107,72,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1k9yuu7/chinas_huawei_develops_new_ai_chip_seeking_to/

I see frequently people post portfolio of SP500 + some individual stock, but that stock is Apple or NVDA. So the question is why would you hold Apple (and similar) and SP500? You are already over exposed to Apple by buying SP500, so why add to the concentration? Wouldn't it be better to invest in a smaller cap name so that you get more diversification (not more concentration) by investing in individual stocks.",17,82,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1k700s8/do_you_worry_about_concentration_risk_of/

If it's the latter of the three, feel free to correct me.

For the past weeks I have seen so many people saying they are holding cash because they point out it's plainly and clearly obvious that in the coming months tariffs will finally take effect and that's when the true hurt will begin. The stock market is still overpriced. The V shape recovery after a crash is a lie this time! A true recession is where stocks will be down for years. Europe hasn't even retaliated yet. The true people who are 20+ aged investors and lived through 2008 know it's time to hold cash and wait. Even Warren Buffet is holding cash!

All pure speculation in my view. If I asked you right now what Trump's next move is, what Xi Jinping's next move it, if there will be a trade deal between USA and China, if Trump is backing down now due to advisors, can you answer any of these with certainty? Can you also tell me that when GOOG, NVDA, UBER, META, AMZN, XOM, etc all report earnings they will tank rather than go up and bring the markets up? Where exactly is the market bottom?

Just stop. Just like how today I can't tell you we are going back to a bull market with reaching ATH by the end of the year because we just had two massive days of rallies and Trump saying he is going to be soft on China with reports that his advisors were shitting the bed about the economy, you equally can't call the opposite about bull traps or whatever. What I can tell you is that you just missed a bunch of blue-chip stocks that were trading for one of their most undervalued prices ever. You should have been buying a week ago, you should be buying now, you should be DCAing stocks you have conviction in until they reach a price you believe is overvalued and you find a better opportunity in another. 

If you are an investor and stock holder, you are in this for the long-run. You are in this 10+ years. Even if your recession thesis plays out the market will recover. If you on the other hand are looking for a short-term, 10x my money in 2-3 years and retire, you're in the wrong place.

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\- Reported Q1 earnings with EPS of $0.27 vs. $0.39 expected and revenue of $19.34B vs. $21.11B expected. Total revenue declined 9% year-over-year, with automotive revenue dropping 20% to $14B. Net income fell 71% to $409M, or $0.12 per share. The company attributed the decline to factory retooling for the refreshed Model Y, lower average selling prices, and increased sales incentives. That was a brutal earnings report, yet Trump announcing that he'll be nice to China saved the stock and pushed the entire market up. Interested in $275 and $250 levels.

Whether this will actually hold and be his stance going forward is entirely up to him (he changed his mind a lot during 2019's trade wars). Assuming that the market holds up today, I'm primarily watching my current positions in NVDA/AAPL and ready to flip short if we make some ridiculously unsustainable move or if Trump changes his mind.

[**LLY (Eli Lilly)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=LLY&p=d)\-Filed lawsuits against four telehealth companies for selling unauthorized compounded versions of its GLP-1 drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound. (LLY's diabetes drug Mounjaro went into short supply in 2022, allowing pharmacies and outsourcing facilities to produce the treatment, a practice called compounding). These drugs generated over $16.4B in revenue last year. Interestingly enough I see this case as pretty major despite not moving the stock significantly today, deciding whether GLP-1 is essentialy ""genericized"" to the point where any company can sell it or only the original developers of the drug. NVO might face the same thing in the future. If LLY loses, that's a huge blow for both of them.

[**HTZ (Hertz)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HTZ&p=d)\-The potential rollback of tariffs by the Trump administration could negatively impact Ackman's thesis that used cars are more valuable due to tariffs. The stock is nearing $9, the previous high when the tariff news was announced. I'm interested in shorting the stock if we make a parabolic move up or if we fail to break $9 (but as always, it's dependent on how we get there). Automotive rental companies have benefited from higher used car values amid tariff-induced supply constraints.

I’m curious how everyone’s portfolio is doing, especially with the recent markets volatility. I think knowing how others are doing will help us all feel a little less alone and probably more calm in this uncertain times in the stock market. Please feel free to add as much information as you would like, including % down (or $ amounts), your age, composition of your portfolio (i.e. what industries), largest holdings, any tactical shifts you’re hoping to make/any changes you have made in your portfolio etc as a way to approach the volatility in the markets.

For me, my portfolio is down 25% from all time highs hit in February. 80% of my stocks are in tech, 25% of my portfolio is NVDA. I have been making some tactical shifts, selling some big tech stocks holdings in favor of non-tech names, although I ended up buying UNH (United Healthcare) thinking it’s would be recession-resistant play, and of course the stock dropped 25% yesterday.",114,513,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1k2i1uj/how_much_is_your_portfolio_down_by/

What I'm wondering is what will happen in the next months. I assume their revenue growth might slow a bit, but not substantially, at least in the Q1 and Q2 earning reports. Therefore I can hardly understand why the tech and semi companies are falling even harder than the overall market. 

Additionally, the trend is towards more digitalisation, automation, and AI usage, which should all speak for rather more need for such companies, and not less. 

I'm of course aware that the WH is currently an attention seeking drama queen. And that the dot com bubble bursted even though the internet is insanely useful. However, what I don't understand is why the potential on a global scale that Tech and Semi have is being mostly overshadowed by the current market conditions?

About five weeks ago, I opened a $25K position in NVDL (500 shares at 50.3$) when NVDA was sitting around $125. I’ve always been a pretty cautious investor, but after watching some colleagues pull in strong gains over the past year,I decided to dip my toes in.

This position is about 10% of my overall portfolio, but I’m currently down around 40%. I’m reaching out to get a sense of what others think. I can handle the loss if there’s still a reasonable shot at breaking even or turning a profit, but what’s really been tough is the decay. At this point, NVDA would need to hit around $135 just for me to break even.

Do you think it makes more sense to cut my losses now and switch into NVDA directly, or just ride it out with NVDL? Would appreciate any thoughts or experiences you’re willing to share.",2,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1k1qi6a/looking_for_general_opinions_on_my_nvdl_position/

[**HTZ (Hertz)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HTZ&p=d)\- Pershing Square Capital Management, led by Bill Ackman, disclosed a stake of 12.7 million shares in HTZ. This caused a surge to $9 yesterday, and I'm interested in how it does at the open, but ultimately biased short. Not interested in taking a short position unless we break $9/10. Interesting thought experiment : Is their fleet of cars is worth far more (after the effects of tariffs) than what the company is actually valued at? 

[**LLY (Eli Lilly)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=LLY&p=d)\- LLY's experimental oral drug, orforglipron, achieved up to 7.9% weight loss and blood sugar reduction in a late-stage trial involving type 2 diabetes patients, exceeding expectations.

NVDA expects a $5.5B charge tied to its H20 chips, while AMD anticipates an $800M impact from its MI308 chips.

I wanted something that:

* Doesn’t rely on me watching CNBC every day
* Doesn’t panic-sell when things get ugly
* Still captures long-term megatrends
* Feels like a **real system**, not a Reddit FOMO portfolio

# Looking for Feedback On:

* Am I *too* diversified?
* Should I consolidate some ETFs or lean harder into fewer themes?
* Am I missing any critical macro theme? (nuclear? private credit? Agri?)
* Would you trust this structure to grow for 30+ years with minimal maintenance?

Looking forward to your feedback on this.

2025-04-16 17:55:58,NVIDIA,NVDA,OpenAI Just Showed Nvidia Bear Case Misunderstands the Reality of AI Scaling - $NVDA,"I keep seeing this recurring bearish argument that “more efficient models” like DeepSeek will reduce the need for massive compute, and therefore hurt Nvidia. That thesis simply doesn’t hold up to scrutiny — especially in light of OpenAI’s latest announcement today.

Take a look at the AIME performance chart from OpenAI’s new frontier model (o3). It shows a **direct, consistent correlation between compute usage and model performance**. More compute = better models. Full stop. No tricks, no shortcuts.

[https://imgur.com/a/MU2z77b](https://imgur.com/a/MU2z77b)

Yes, we’re seeing architectural improvements that increase training efficiency. But these gains don’t shrink the pie — **they expand it**. Every efficiency gain is reinvested into building even larger and more capable models. This is the scaling law trend, and Nvidia is at the center of it.

Now to DeepSeek: impressive optimization work, but let’s be real — their model is just riding on top of the massive foundation Nvidia enabled. DeepSeek’s “efficiency” is only relevant because **they still needed access to high-end GPUs to train it in the first place**. No one is training SOTA on CPUs or low-cost commodity hardware. Every frontier model — whether from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or DeepSeek — relies on Nvidia’s stack to get off the ground.

Here’s the bullish reality:

* Model performance still scales with compute — OpenAI just showed us that again.
* Efficient models don’t kill GPU demand; they unlock **even more ambitious models** and **more widespread deployments**.
* Inference is exploding. Every assistant, every copilots, every agent… all of them need sustained GPU access.
* Nvidia has built a full-stack moat: CUDA, TensorRT, networking, and ecosystem lock-in.

The smarter argument isn’t that Nvidia demand will fall — it’s that demand will **explode in more directions**: training, inference, on-device, edge. Efficient models don’t reduce Nvidia’s relevance. They increase the number of use cases and drive **horizontal expansion** of AI compute.",19,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1k0qunb/openai_just_showed_nvidia_bear_case/

[Gold](https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/investing/article/gold-price-today-wednesday-april-16-2025-gold-opens-with-new-high-134956304.html) has surpassed the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks as the most crowded trade on Wall Street as the precious metal surged to record highs this year amid volatile markets and an uncertain economic backdrop.

According to the latest Bank of America fund managers survey published this week, nearly half of the fund managers surveyed (49%) see long gold, or bets that gold prices will rise, as the most crowded trade in the market right now. This marks the first time in two years that fund managers did not see the Magnificent Seven as Wall Street's most crowded trade, according to the survey.

Tesla stock has led Magnificent Seven losses and is down about 38% since the start of 2025. Apple stock has fallen 21%.

Nvidia stock has also declined 21% year to date.

Shares of Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon — the remainder of the Magnificent Seven — are all down by double-digit percentages since the start of the year.

Gold's rally comes as [central banks' demand hit all-time highs](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-demand-hits-record-levels-as-central-banks-buy-at-eye-watering-pace-205945413.html) last year and as investors increased inflows into physical gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

""The new highs in gold are signaling a shift in appetite for US assets,"" Ryan McIntyre, senior managing partner at asset manager firm Sprott, recently told Yahoo Finance.

""Confidence in the US has clearly been shaken, so people are looking to diversify.""

Some 42% of fund managers expect gold will be the best-performing asset of 2025, up from 23% in March, according to Bank of America.

Most of these brokerages have been selling off from the market peak around mid Feb, but I don't consider these to be interesting at the moment for outperformance, unless they fall further. Risks to watch out for in these include decreasing retail trading activity, fee compression, and competition from zero-commission platforms. (Also worth noting HOOD also fell from the Feb market peak)

[**META (Meta)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=META&p=d)\- Zuck testified in an FTC antitrust trial about Meta's acquisition of Instagram, with internal emails suggesting shady motives. The FTC alleges the moves were to neutralize competition and monopolize the social media space. We've had a significant selloff for the past 2 months from 750 to 500, and while not extremely liquid due to price/volume, it's still worth pursuing if there is some catalyst for a forced sale of Instagram (unlikely). Risks include potential breakup rulings (this is the white whale trade), broader regulatory clampdowns, and increased oversight of tech M&A (we've seen less M&A already this year in the Trump admin mainly due to volatility).

[**ASML (Advanced Semiconductor Materials Lithography)-**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASML&p=d)  Reported Q1 net sales of €7.74B vs €7.8B expected, and net profit of €2.36B vs €2.3B expected. **Net bookings came in at €3.94B vs €4.89B expected, well below forecasts.** CEO flagged tariff-related uncertainty as a key risk to forward demand. Order shortfall is a bad sign (and also an explanation for why the rest of the semis fell as well). I typically don't trade super high priced stocks like this due to the spread but ultimately interested if we fall further to last week's levels (\~$600).",24,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1k0k38d/0416_interesting_stocks_today_he_who_controls_the/

# Key Takeaways

* Netflix shares jumped Tuesday after a report company executives laid out ambitious targets at a business review meeting last month.
* The streaming giant aims to double its revenue by 2030 and reach a market capitalization of $1 trillion, *The* *Wall Street Journal* reported Monday.
* Netflix is set to report first-quarter results after the market closes Thursday.

Netflix (NLFX) shares jumped Tuesday following a report company executives laid out ambitious targets at a business review meeting last month.

Executives said the streaming giant aims to double the $39 billion in revenue Netflix brought in last year, with a global ad sales target of $9 billion by 2030, *The* *Wall Street Journal* reported Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The streaming giant also aims to reach a [market capitalization](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp) of $1 trillion by 2030, the report said, up from roughly $419.2 billion. The only U.S. companies with a market cap above $1 trillion today include Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B).

Netflix did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Shares were up more than 5% in recent trading Tuesday, leading gains on the S&P 500. They've added about 60% of their value over the past 12 months. (Read *Investopedia's* live coverage of [today's market action here](https://www.investopedia.com/dow-jones-today-04152025-11715325).)

Last week, Morgan Stanley analysts named Netflix a [“top pick,”](https://www.investopedia.com/netflix-a-top-pick-for-morgan-stanley-on-expected-resilience-to-a-weaker-market-11712037) arguing the company could be well-positioned to withstand the current tariff landscape. The streaming giant has shown ""momentum” in its core subscription business, the analysts said. That momentum lowers the company’s overall risk, the bank added, even if the advertising market struggles amid rising trade tensions.

Interested in MP's $30 level. Rare earth metals are important because they're used in technology, electronics, defense, and literally everything with a computer, with China controlling over 80% of all REMs. It is noteworthy that China entirely refines these metals and produces 90% of the global supply of these magnets. We're back in BLOPS2 baby! 

[**BA (Boeing)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BA&p=d)\-China has ordered its airlines to suspend deliveries of Boeing jets and halt purchases of aircraft-related equipment and parts from U.S. companies, a direct response to the U.S. imposing tariffs as high as 145% on Chinese goods. Interested in the $150 level. China is a significant market for BA, accounting for a substantial portion (20%!) of its projected deliveries over the next two decades. Despite being far smaller in comparison to Airbus, BA's planes are reserved years in advance, making it difficult for China to avoid using U.S. planes.

[**BULL (Webull Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BULL&p=d)\-Webull Corporation completed a reverse merger with SK Growth Opportunities Corporation and is finally listed after delaying their IPO for years. Overall not interested in this unless we break yesterday's highs, as the price 8x'ing seems ludicrous for a company that should be priced relatively easily (because we have comparables such as HOOD/other brokerages). I'm biased negatively on this stock today.

[**NVDA (Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\-Nvidia has announced plans to invest up to $500B in building AI supercomputers entirely in the United States. This initiative includes establishing over a million square feet of manufacturing space in Texas, partnering with companies like Foxconn and Wistron. This seems like a play to avoid getting semis tariffed, although the outcome is uncertain, especially with Trump announcing upcoming tariffs in a month or two. Overall see a lot more uncertainty in this stock and AAPL, so extremely important to be aware of the tariff narrative.

“Tariffs will be negotiated away. Buy as much stocks as possible!

Everyone here is panicking and thinking these tariffs are going to destroy everything. It’s not an incorrect thought… IF they stay in effect for a long period. 

However it’s important to listen to what Trump has said. Trump said he’s open to tarrif cuts if countries offer something phenomenal. He also said now these countries will be coming to us to negotiate rather than the other way around. He used tik tok as an example to say he may cut tarrif on china to close a tik tok deal. 

Trump put these tariffs in effect to give him huge leverage over every country. He even bragged that every country has called him to negotiate. Acting tough like the tariffs will be in place for a few years, is ONLY to increase their leverage. The more difficult it seems to remove tariffs the more negotiating power Trump has. 

This is a rare stock crash where it’s completely self inflicted with the signing of a pen from the president. This means to end this pain will ONLY take the president to end the tariffs- which can be done instantly. 

I am very sure this will be exactly like the Covid crash. He will keep talking a big talk and more and more terrible news will come out. But then there will be cracks as exceptions are made and deals are negotiated. This is literally the man who wrote “Art of the Deal”. He is 100% transactional and is always aiming to make a deal.

Personally I am buying AI stocks like crazy. This is probably the last chance to get on the AI boat before this stuff rockets. SMH, ASML, NVDA, AMZN META—- all these big tech names will come out fine long term. No matter how scary it gets just keep buying. “",0,56,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jvgeuy/i_warned_everyone_tariffs_were_a_negotiating/

Well, this ended up becoming a little trilogy. The market has went down, a lot, and the big question is: 

Is this time to buy?

I think so. I have been, over Thursday and Friday. 

Why?

1. Because these tariffs are bad. They are so bad that, if unchanged, they will cause not only a recession, but I think there will be riots on the streets within 6 months. 

2. Trump -- and the republican party -- are on a timer. Midterms are next year. They need to show results, not a crashing economy. Republicans are already starting to voice discontent. Ted Cruz *openly* stated this could be a ""political bloodbath"". If tariffs stay on, republicans will break ranks. Anything else is political suicide. 

3. This leads me to conclude that tariffs will be removed. Either via Trump or through congressional action. Maybe even impeachment. The result? Markets moon. 

This leads me to 3 scenarios: 

1. Tariffs end quickly via renegotiation or Trump just backing down. I mean, islands with penguins? Seriously? Trump declares victory.

2. Some tariffs (China) stay, many others are removed. Certain industries benefit, others feel pain.

3. Tariffs stay on long enough to necessitate public/congressional intervention. Political chaos, recession, Maga goose cooked.

In scenario 1 and 2, damage is limited and markets ascend quickly. Remember, most gains come from certain days. 
In scenario 3, damage includes a recession. Earnings go down and valuations may retreat to ~16, which is ~4400 on the S&P. We are at 5070 now.

I'm deploying 80% of cash to buy. Keeping 20% safe, just in case.

So far, I've bought financials (KRE, WAL), tech (INTC, NVDA, META), retailers (NKE, RH) and SPY. Also, some LCID and RKLB for funsies. 

Is this the low? I don't know. China and the EU can wait Trump out, I think. Standing up to Trump and tariffs will be domestically popular for them. Which means they will not renegotiate. Which means action must come from the US. 

But, sitting on cash for too long is foolish, unless you live in Omaha. Spy has already fallen from 613 in Feb when I went short; and from 560 in March when I went cash. Things are now a lot more attractive. 

To summarize my theory, I hope that the adults in Washington step up, stop executive overreach, and we all benefit. It might take some time. I suggest writing to your representatives in Congress. I have.

**China announced a 34% tariff on the US. The US may retaliate. ""Reciprocal"" tariffs can result in a positive feedback loop of the tariff percentage.**

News: [China Imposes 34 Tariffs On All Us Imports As Retaliation](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-04/china-imposes-34-tariffs-on-all-us-imports-as-retaliation)

**AVGO, NXPI, LRCX, AMAT- ALL OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE 20%+ OF THEIR SALES COME FROM CHINA)**\- China imposing a 34% tariff on US imports escalates trade tensions and impacts supply chains, all of which have significant exposure to China. Overall, most interested in NVDA at $95/$90 and possibly INTC at $20 if we don't spike off the open. I'm leaning more bearish for today due to the news being announced so early premarket from China, and also from the fear of the US announcing additional tariffs.

[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\- AAPL broke $200 premarket following the announcement- mainly due to approximately 20% of AAPL revenue comingfrom China. I'm interested mainly if it breaks $190 intraday. AAPL relies heavily on China for manufacturing, with over 90% of its production based there and newly imposed tariffs are expected to increase AAPL’s annual costs by $8.5B. China adding more tariffs affects AAPL as it is clearly the biggest MAG7 loser of the tariffs. Main risks involve increased production costs, potential price hikes for consumers, and a possible decline in sales volume because our damn phones get far more expensive. Additionally, further escalation in trade tensions could lead to more severe supply chain disruptions. 

[**VXX (VIX Short-Term Futures ETN)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&p=d)\- I still don't think we've peaked (as I mentioned yesterday). We've spiked to \~$40 on the VIX ($75 on VXX). I'm interested in seeing how the US will respond to China tariffs before making any significant trades. The risk in the VXX short is based on overnight headlines from China announcing more tariffs (which already happened), and now, waiting for the US to retaliate. Fun.

[**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d)**,** [**FXI (China Large-Cap ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FXI&p=d)**,** [**YINN (China Bull 3X Shares)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=YINN&p=d)**,** [**YANG (China Bear 3X Shares)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=YANG&p=d)**,** [**JD (JD.com)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=JD&p=d)\- China-related stocks are selling off due to expectations of retaliation from the US. Also currently just a ""watch"", everything hinges on if the US backs off from tariffs or if we escalate. Interested in BABA if it hits $100.

2025-04-04 11:03:55,NVIDIA,NVDA,Tariffs will be negotiated away. Buy as much stocks as possible!,"Everyone here is panicking and thinking these tariffs are going to destroy everything. It’s not an incorrect thought… IF they stay in effect for a long period. 

However it’s important to listen to what Trump has said. Trump said he’s open to tarrif cuts if countries offer something phenomenal. He also said now these countries will be coming to us to negotiate rather than the other way around. He used tik tok as an example to say he may cut tarrif on china to close a tik tok deal. 

Trump put these tariffs in effect to give him huge leverage over every country. He even bragged that every country has called him to negotiate. Acting tough like the tariffs will be in place for a few years, is ONLY to increase their leverage. The more difficult it seems to remove tariffs the more negotiating power Trump has. 

This is a rare stock crash where it’s completely self inflicted with the signing of a pen from the president. This means to end this pain will ONLY take the president to end the tariffs- which can be done instantly. 

I am very sure this will be exactly like the Covid crash. He will keep talking a big talk and more and more terrible news will come out. But then there will be cracks as exceptions are made and deals are negotiated. This is literally the man who wrote “Art of the Deal”. He is 100% transactional and is always aiming to make a deal.

Personally I am buying AI stocks like crazy. This is probably the last chance to get on the AI boat before this stuff rockets. SMH, ASML, NVDA, AMZN META—- all these big tech names will come out fine long term. No matter how scary it gets just keep buying.

Tech stocks plummeted on Thursday, with Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)) leading ""Magnificent Seven"" names lower following President Trump's[ reciprocal tariff announcement](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-every-country-facing-reciprocal-tariffs-announced-by-trump-on-liberation-day-231329935.html) the day prior.

Shares of Apple, on track for their worst day since March 2020, cratered over 8% in afternoon trade as the stock erased $300 billion from its market cap. The largest risk, according to analysts, centers on the iPhone maker's overseas production hubs, which are particularly vulnerable to the tariffed countries.

On Wednesday, Trump announced tariffs that will impact some 185 countries, including the United States's largest trading partners. Additional reciprocal tariffs, for instance, will include 34% tariffs on Chinese imports, a 20% tariff on European Union imports, a 46% tariff on imports from Vietnam, 32% on imports from Taiwan, and 26% on India — all set to take effect on April 9.

Notably, the additional 34% tax on China will be added to the country's existing 20% tariff, meaning its total tariff rate will rise to 54%. China is Apple's most important [production hub](https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook-apple-supply-chain-trump-tariffs-china-diversify-iphone-2025-1?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=yahoo.com), with about 85% of its iPhones manufactured there.

""Apple produces basically all their iPhones in China, and the question will be around exceptions and exemptions on this tariff policy if those companies are building more operations, factories, and plants in the US[ like Apple announced in February](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-will-spend-more-than-500-billion-usd-in-the-us-over-the-next-four-years/),"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients following the announcement.

As trade tensions escalate, Apple has moved to increase its supply chain beyond just China, boosting manufacturing in places like India and Vietnam. But with the new tariff announcements set to impact those countries too, there's now limited room for reprieve.

""The worry will be around pricing and margin impacts along with what this means for the global supply chain looking forward,"" Ives said. For now, the analyst continues to believe major negotiations will happen over the coming months as companies attempt to navigate ""this new world of tariffs.""

Until then, he warned, ""tech stocks will clearly be under major pressure.""

Other Magnificent Seven players also faced significant selling action. In aggregate, that cohort of stocks is currently on track to eliminate over $800 billion from their collective market caps.

In afternoon trade, Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)) and Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) each fell 7%, followed by a 6% drop in both Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL)) and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)). Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)) dipped 3%, while Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)) was off just under 2%.

Outside of the Mag Seven, chip stocks faced similar declines, despite the exemption of semiconductors from Trump's additional tariffs. Nvidia competitor Broadcom ([AVGO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AVGO)), for example, erased well over $50 billion from its market cap following an 8% drop in shares.

""The implications \[of the announced tariffs\] are broad-reaching, and we see negative implications for the whole \[chip\] sector,"" KeyBanc analyst John Vinh wrote in a note to clients. ""These are most notably going to negatively impact end-demand in key markets including smartphones/iPhones and PCs, as a significant amount of manufacturing is done within China.""

Stacy Rasgon, Bernstein's managing director and senior analyst, added in an interview with Yahoo Finance that the biggest headwind for semiconductors is not necessarily the direct impact of tariffs. Rather, it's the risk of demand destruction as these products become more expensive.

He added, ""The other risk for semis is that they are very cyclical, very global, and very correlated to the macro and to GDP. [So if this tips us into recession, ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-economy-dangerously-vulnerable-to-recession-wall-street-reacts-to-tariff-fallout-155837444.html)that's probably not going to be great.""",215,63,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jqpre5/apple_sheds_300_billion_in_tarifffueled_selloff/

News: [Trump's Tariff Announcement](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2025-04-02/trump-s-tariff-announcement)

[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\- 34% tariff on Chinese imports, adding to existing duties, brings the total to 54% effective April 9. AAPL relies heavily on Chinese manufacturing, and these tariffs are expected to lead to increased production costs, which will be passed on to consumers through higher prices. Watching $200, but likely the stock I'm going to play if there's any chance of a bounce (in addition to NVDA). These tariffs will result in retaliatory measures from China, further impacting Apple's supply chain and profitability. Additionally, prolonged tariffs could lower consumer demand due to higher prices. Related Tickers: AVGO, SWKS, TSM, QCOM.

[**CRWV (CoreWeave)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRWV&p=d)\- Google is reportedly in advanced discussions to rent Nvidia's Blackwell AI servers from CoreWeave. This potential partnership is huge because it means that CRWV has a little more diversification in their revenue stream (alleviating a huge risk to the company). It's hard, this has risen so much from the IPO but we're back at pre-tariff and pre-announcement prices- have a small long position but likely will exit due to all the craziness today and need to focus on the bigger fish. Despite Taiwanese chips not being tariffed, CRWV will likely benefit due to the rising costs of chips.

[**RH (Restoration Hardware)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RH&p=d)\- Reported EPS of $1.58 vs $1.92 expected. Revenue of $812M vs $829M. The company issued guidance for the current fiscal year, projecting revenue growth of 10% to 13%, an adjusted operating margin between 14% and 15%, and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 20% to 21%. Management highlighted concerns over a higher-risk business environment due to tariffs, market volatility, and inflation risks, noting that RH has been operating in the ""worst housing market in almost 50 years."" Interested at $150, but won't focus on this today vs AAPL or other Mag7 names that are selling off.

[**VXX (VIX Short-Term Futures ETN)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&p=d)\- The recent spike in volatility attributed to ""Liberation Day"" saw a massive VIX spike along with everything else selling off. Interested in seeing what we do but I doubt today will be the day I take a short position- volatility is coming and is not as likely to be the quick one-day spikes we've seen in the past. We may see additional tariffs from China in retaliation.

[**NKE (Nike)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NKE&p=d)\- Nike is one of the biggest losers due to tariffs, as a substantial portion of its manufacturing is based in Southeast Asian countries facing high tariff rates. Notably, Nike produces nearly 50% of its footwear and 30% of its apparel in Vietnam. Currently long, but will bail if we break new lows (\~$55.20). Prolonged tariffs lead to higher consumer prices, and NKE has cited lowered demand/guidance for its goods due to competitors.

[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\- NVIDIA's exposure to the recent tariff announcements appears limited, as the 32% levy on imports from Taiwan.

Nvidia Stock Is Falling. Not Even Chip Exemption Saves It From Broad Slump.

2:28 PM-Apr 3

NVDA

By Adam Clark

Nvidia looks set to fall sharply following President Donald Trump's imposition of sweeping tariffs on imports to the U.S. The chip maker escaped specific levies but the wider market reaction and fears of Chinese retaliation are set to drag on the shares.

Nvidia shares were down 3.2% at $106.93 in the Thursday premarket having tumbled 5.7% at $104.15 in after-hours trading. The stock rose 0.3% during Wednesday's session.

The tariff announcement wasn't quite as bad as it could have been for Nvidia. Trump said the levy on imports for Taiwan - where Nvidia's chips are mostly manufactured - will be set at 32%. However, the White House published a fact sheet after Trump's announcement that said semiconductors would not be subject to that reciprocal tariff.

That doesn't mean chip tariffs are off the table entirely. Products such as semiconductors, pharmaceuticals and lumber will be addressed separately, a senior administration official said.

The other major concern is likely to be potential retaliation from Beijing, with Chinese goods now facing total duties of 54% after the latest tariff announcements.

Among other chip makers, Advanced Micro Devices fell 5.8% in after-hours trading and Broadcom was down 6.3%.

Meanwhile, Nvidia on Wednesday said its Blackwell computing platform set performance records in tests for inferencing - the process of generating output from Al models - carried out by MLCommons, an open engineering consortium.

There has been speculation over whether Nvidia's dominant position in Al chips would weaken as the focus shifts from training Al models to inference. The company has pushed back hard against that, noting inference makes up around 40% of its data-center revenue and is growing fast. It says that its NVL72 server system delivers a fourfold improvement in Al model training but up to a 30 times improvement in inference compared with previous systems.

They also had the largest funding round in history, $40 Billion raised. Where is the **$40 BILLION** going to go? my guess is NVDA, maybe AVGO for custom chips.

We are still in the relatively new stages of large language models and we still have chip shortages, when robotics's development expands the shortage will persist.

2025-04-01 22:26:35,NVIDIA,NVDA,Bought NVDA at the wrong time? Not sure what to do next,"Hi everyone,

I know absolutely nothing about investing. My understanding is just: I buy stocks, they can go up or down, and I either make or lose money.

On January 6th, I bought 73 shares of NVIDIA. I had heard from friends that they made good money with it, so I thought I’d try it too.

I’m from Brazil, and I paid BRL 1,381.61. Now my investment is worth BRL 951.92 — that’s a loss of BRL 429.24.

Looking at the chart on Google, it seems like I got unlucky and bought right before it dropped.

My question is: should I just accept the loss and take my money out before it drops more? Or should I leave it there and hope for the best?

I honestly have no clue what might happen next, and to be honest, I’m not really interested in learning more about investing — I just want to make a reasonable decision here.

Thanks in advance!

EDIT: Based on the comments, I think it's important to clarify that I didn't have any specific goal with this investment — I just wanted to grow my money over the long term. I was aware of the risk of losing money, so I only invested an amount I was comfortable with potentially losing. From what I've read in the comments, it seems like holding onto these shares for the long term might actually be a good idea (Apparently even buying more haha).",0,93,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jp8s83/bought_nvda_at_the_wrong_time_not_sure_what_to_do/

News: [US Stock Futures Tumble Ahead Of New Trump Tariffs: Markets Wrap ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-30/us-stock-futures-tumble-ahead-of-new-trump-tariffs-markets-wrap)

[**SPY**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SPY&p=d)**,** [**QQQ** ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=QQQ&p=d)**,** [**VXX** ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&p=d)**,** [**USO**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=USO&p=d) , larger tech stocks - ""Liberation day"" (additional tariffs) is nearing, causing the market to selloff due to fears of escalating trade tensions and potential global growth impacts . We're pretty close to near lows from 3/13 (18 days ago, lol). 

Overall will be trying to buy a bounce for a day trade if we do end up breaking, but probably will be more focused on a VXX short rather than buying the market overall. I'm interested if we selloff or pop on the open, if we break new lows I may short/then flip long. This kind of headline-driven macro environment is a pain in the ass to keep track of, but creates a lot more opportunity for short-term trading. Risks that can change the tariff narrative or move the market include unexpected retaliation from trade partners, weakening consumer/investor confidence (like last week's numbers), and spillover into energy and commodity prices (Trump has signaled some action on oil, but we aren't sure what yet). 

**NVDA**[ **(Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\- Another interesting thing that caught my eye this morning are reports from Chinese media that NVDA's new chip (GB300) are significantly delayed due to complexity and may be a quarter or two delayed (thus resulting in missed/delayed revenue). This could explain why NVDA is down significantly more (-3.5%) vs other semis. 

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d) \- Analysts have trimmed Q1 delivery estimates for TSLA amid weakening demand trends and delays in its Model Q vehicle (the cheap, Robotoaxi car). There have also been articles of divestment from pension/investing funds that are invested in TSLA that I've read, but whether those are serious, I'd hold judgement on. 

Delivery numbers are expected Wednesday and typically report premarket, so good to be cognizant of that. I'm interested in seeing if we can hold below $250 today. The EV sector in general has entered a consolidation phase, with cost competition and flagging consumer incentives weighing on demand, and BYD is hot on TSLA's heels and likely going to overtake TSLA within the year. Below-consensus deliveries could spark a guidance reset for earnings, margin compression of their other cars due to the Model Q, and market share loss in China and Europe are key concerns. Also random people torching Tesla dealerships.

[**PLTR (Palantir Technologies Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR&p=d) \- No material news catalyst, but PLTR has experienced five consecutive red sessions and is likely moving with the overall stock rout. Worth noting that PLTR cut close to 60% of its IT Team (said by CTO in recent interview), and DoD cut close to $600M in spending (which affects PLTR). Also worth noting that we are EXACTLY right back to where we started before we had significant retail interest in this stock ($80). The broader AI/data analytics sector has seen a pullback after a multi-month run and has been somewhat outpaced rational valuation so not too interested in this for the long term.

2025-03-28 03:07:37,NVIDIA,NVDA,"CoreWeave, the biggest IPO of 2025. (DD on $CRWV)","# I love IPOs.

The last IPO I thought was amazing was ARM (and how far we've come!).  Coreweave (IPOing on the 28th!) is another one I think has a ton of potential. (I wrote the majority of this before the reduced IPO sizing so please forgive me if my math is incorrect).

CoreWeave is a cloud infrastructure provider specializing in GPU computing, called an “AI hyperscaler.” They run data centers full of GPUs and rent out that computing power to customers via the cloud. Similar to AWS/Azure, but they're focused on AI/ML/GPU tasks like making stupid Studio Ghibli pictures of yourself.

CRWV started in 2017 mining ETH but pivoted to being a GPU farm in 2019 after the crash. By 2022, they fully exited crypto mining and doubled down on enterprise GPU cloud services​. This early mover advantage in GPU hosting, (along with all the GPUs they bought from NVDA), have made it a player in the the cloud services space.

CRWV makes money by charging for usage-based cloud compute - clients pay for GPU hours on their servers.​ Initially, they served niches like VFX studios (movies like Interstellar take millions of GPU hours to render), but now AI training and inference workloads are the main growth driver​.

Companies like META/IBM/MSFT have used CRWV for AI compute needs in the past​. CRWV's differentiator is through software- they claim custom scheduling software (e.g. a system called “SUNK” and an optimizer “Tensorizer”) that yields better hardware utilization, faster container spin-ups, and higher throughput than general-purpose which makes them more efficient to use.

In practice, that means a customer training a large ML model might get results faster or cheaper on CRWV than on AWS. CRWV currently operates 32 data centers with 250k+ NVDA GPUs and are very aggressive in acquiring them- they deploy A100, H100, and H200s and are prioritized as customers of NVDA.

**The NVDA Relationship**

NVDA backs CRWV, and they're strong partners (which means they prioritize each other over other customers). Due to this, I dismiss the possibility that CRWV will ever have troubles on the supply side of obtaining GPUs. Something that is fairly common knowledge is that NVDA (and other companies) prefer selling GPUs in bulk because it simplifies customer service and they can charge for enterprise support and  sell thousands at a time. It's also why NVDA spits on the face of their gaming customers.

**Isn't it kind of shady that NVDA both invests and is a customer of CRWV? Why doesn't NVDA use their own chips instead of renting capacity from CRWV?**

Kind of. Nothing they've done is outright illegal (even using their GPUs as collateral is within the law). Even companies that build GPUs need to rent compute when there's a massive amount of demand. MSFT did it, NVDA did it, OpenAI WILL do it. CRWV signed a direct deal with OpenAI: a multi-year commitment up to $11.9 B for GPU cloud capacity​. They have ties to the major AI players. This entire DD going forward assumes that they will continue to keep their relationship with NVDA because NVDA needs them so AWS doesn't swallow the entire market. 

**The Financials**

CRWV has had ridiculous growth- In 2022, they had revenue of $15.8 M (the majority of which came from ETH mining). In 2023, their GPU computing pivot led to revenue of $229M, then $1.9B in 2024. This was obviously fueled by the release of ChatGPT as demand for GPU compute exploded as other companies scrambled to compete with their OWN LLM models.

By 2024, CRWV neared $2 B in annual sales, transforming from a niche player to a major cloud provider in two years.

The financial issue is that CRWV is unprofitable as it scales. In 2023, it lost \~$600M, and in 2024m \~$860M. For every $1 of revenue in 2024, they spent about $1.45 for huge investments in data centers, GPUs, and the associated operating costs (plus interest on debt they've taken out which they have a ton of).

The S-1 shows operating costs close to \~$1B from tech/infra in 2024, which includes data center space, buying/depreciating their GPUs, electricity costs, maintenance staff, etc. The capex is massive and is funded largely by debt.

The cash burn is brutal as well- at the end of 2024 CRWV still has negative FCF (which is normal for a pre-ipo high growth tech startup) and is betting that they will eventually claw their way to profitability despite the brutal looking financials (like Uber, Snowflake, Robinhood, insert your choice of tech startup here lol). The bet is that high upfront investment now will secure long-term contracts and scale to profitability later, like most tech IPOs.

**Customer Concentration**

In 2023, Microsoft accounted for \~35% of CRWV’s revenue​. In 2024, that grew to \~62% of total revenue​. Their S-1 mentioned that close to \~80% of their revenue comes from two customers alone. But this is a warning sign because MSFT wants to build their own (hence their announcement of spending \~$80B in 2025 for AI data centers).

**If MSFT scales back their use of CRWV then they are frankly fucked.** MSFT's CEO also mentioned that using external capacity (like CRWV) for GPUs was a short-term stopgap until their own investment in Azure pays off.

However, the OpenAI deal (remember that OpenAI is 49% owned by MSFT) could take the place of MSFT going forward. The contract is up to $11.9B through 2030​, which averages out to \~$2B/year if used, which is equivalent to all of CRWV's 2024 revenue.  If OpenAI maximizes their usage, CRWV’s revenue could potentially double at minimum if MSFT doesn't pull out. This is a wild hopium optimistic case but I thought it was worth mentioning.

Beyond those two, CRWV has other customers that make up the \~20% of 2024 revenue). These include research labs, VFX studios, and other tech companies but none are individually as large compared to the MSFT/OpenAI. What will make or break this company in the long run is the diversification of the client base because all their eggs are in one basket.

**IPO Technicals**

CRWV sold 37.5M shares at $40/share, getting $1.5B and giving it a $20B valuation. That was below CRWV's official target of offering 49M shares at $47-$55, raising up to $2.7B at $32B valuation​. This signals a lack of interest in the initial offering and is not great news if you already hold the stock, but is excellent if you're a short term trader that wants to see a pop on IPO day- the stock has more room to run. Yes, this means it's good for retail, bad for insiders.

**Valuation/Comparables**

Is a \~$20B valuation reasonable for CRWV? You can do a rough comparison:

|**Company**|Annual Revenue (2024)|**Recent Valuation**|**EV/Revenue Multiple**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**CoreWeave** (CRWV)|$1.92 B|\~$20B (target IPO)|\~10×|

(That's not a typo- AWS is valued at \~$500B, it's the main driver of AMZN's growth, yet struggles to grow because it's already massive). \*Also note that Databricks is a private company

I think that if the company can maintain a hyper-growth trajectory (e.g. 2-3× growth for a couple more years), then an 10× multiple now could look cheap in hindsight. For instance, 2025 revenue could hit \~$4 B+ with the OpenAI ramp and other clients. Of course, we have risks like growth decelerating, and tariffs and Trump and China that could come in and decimate growth. And of course, they're not profitable (for now). Ironically, CRWV and other US firms would BENEFIT from chip restrictions because they'd be prioritized over the overseas ones that use NVDA chips.

CRWV’s valuation is aggressive (dare I say fair for a hyperscaler), but in line  with other cloud providers. The entire short term bull thesis depends on them retaining MSFT as a customer and also keeping OpenAI- if that occurs then investing in it now looks like a no-brainer. If not, **it's completely possible we see an 50%+ selloff. I think that's the reason why we're seeing such hesitancy in this valuation.**

This valuation is also dependent on entirely dependent on AI spending GROWING, society seeing greater integration in AI (more than we have now), and AI firms willing to continue spending on compute they can't harness themselves. We are still supply constrained on GPUs in general, and if we ever experience NVDA building more GPUs than there is demand for, then Coreweave's margins are threatened and profitability can vanish. For now, it looks like that is unlikely to happen.

**IPO Trading Details**

37.5M shares is decent IPO volume so I don't expect this to be illiquid when it trades. The main things I watch for are indication price (whether there are people who want to buy the print of the stock higher than what we IPO at) and share paired (which somewhat signal when the IPO will open for trading).

Overall, this is a pure AI play on GPU compute, a bet that demand for GPUs will continue to outstrip supply,  and that MSFT/OpenAI/every other tech firm involved won't slit their throat in in the eternal game of thrones that is capitalism.

**TL;DR:** There's a hell of a lot of risk, but I like the stock. It's completely possible it could open and sell off because the insiders just want to bail. It's possible that it skyrockets. Anything is possible in the wild and crazy world of IPO trading.

News: [Trump Says Tariffs Coming In April Will Probably Be More Lenient Than Reciprocal](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/26/trump-says-tariffs-coming-in-april-will-probably-be-more-lenient-than-reciprocal.html)

[**GME (GameStop)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME&p=d) **-** Reported earnings, EPS of $0.29 vs $0.08 expected. EPS beat estimates, and the company announced it would integrate Bitcoin into its treasury reserve. This confirms prior speculation tied to Ryan Cohen’s meeting with Strategy’s chairman. **This is a massive catalyst** solely based on the fact that if GME buys enough of the CC, we may see it trade at a premium the same way as MSTR does. (MSTR usually trades at a 2x valuation to the amount of CC it holds.). Volatility in the CC market could create swings in reported earnings, but makes GME easier to track price-wise. The core retail business still saw a 28% Y/Y decline in sales which is somewhat of a red flag. Biased positive.

**Related Tickers:** MSTR, COIN

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\- Second day of straight gains, with shares up 3.5% after a close to 50% selloff. I'm Interested in $290 level after failing to break above it in the premarket. EV sentiment remains mixed for TSLA going forward- despite weakness in European sales, investor sentiment appears to be shifting positive. Sales in Europe fell 40% Y/Y, and Canada’s EV rebate freeze adds regulatory actions into the mix. BYD is also close to overtaking TSLA, so I still don't consider this investible for the long-term (but it is tradable).

[**DLTR (Dollar Tree)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DLTR&p=d)**-** DLTR will divest its Family Dollar segment for \~$1B to Brigade Capital and Macellum, a massive markdown from the $9B it paid in 2015. The stock reacted fairly positively on this news, mainly because DLTR has been struggling since COVID. This move is an effort to clean up the balance sheet and refocus on the core business. The market probably views this favorably in the face of tariffs - less potential exposure to Family Dollar inevitably underperforming.

**Related Tickers:** DG

[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\- New energy rules in China disqualify NVDA's exportable H20 chip, threatening near-term revenue from a key market. Seen a minor selloff in NVDA of roughly $2, interested to see if we sell off more at the open. China’s energy mandates are squeezing data center hardware providers, forcing chipmakers to adapt or lose access to the market. Having the H20 not be usable is a huge blow to NVDA's revenue, as it makes up close to 10% of their revenue in 2024. More regulation or bans could further limit access to Chinese demand, other chipmakers, etc. This DOES seem targeted to have Chinese companies focus on

2025-03-25 22:14:10,NVIDIA,NVDA,Stocks Close Higher for 3rd Straight Day; Tesla Surges in Late Trading to Extend Rally,"
Major indexes closed slightly higher Tuesday as the stock market continued its recovery from an extended selloff.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite added 0.2% and 0.5%, respectively, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose fractionally. Stocks had kicked off the week with big gains following news that President Trump could scale back some of the tariffs that are due to be imposed next week on U.S. trading partners. With the recent gains, the Dow has inched back into positive territory for 2025, as stocks have rebounded from a month-long selloff spurred by concerns about the potential impact of tariffs and uncertainty about the outlook for the economy.

Investors brushed off consumer confidence data released this morning that came in weaker than expected, with the index hitting its lowest level in more than four years. Investors are closing watching all data points amid worries that tariffs could reignite inflation and cause economic growth to stall. The big economic report of the week comes Friday with the scheduled release of the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which had fallen during the recent stock market rout amid the growing concerns about the economy, was at 4.32% in late trading, down from 4.33% at yesterday's close and from an earlier high Tuesday of 4.37%. The yield, which affects costs on all sorts of loans, notably mortgages, hit its highest level in more than a month this morning.

Mega-cap technology stocks, which helped lead Monday's rally, were mostly higher again today. Shares of Tesla (TSLA) rallied late in the day to finish 3.5% higher, gaining ground for the 5th consecutive session, despite news Tuesday that the EV maker's sales in Europe continued to slide. Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta Platforms (META) each rose more than 1%, while Microsoft (MSFT) inched ahead. Chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) closed slightly lower

2025-03-22 19:17:09,NVIDIA,NVDA,Honest question from long term investor,"I’ve been a long term investor for decades. I’m in solid stocks including the M7. My question, “Should I pull out of at least my M7 (already cashed out TSLA) from the market to cash and reenter well after April 6th?”  So at this point I’m up on all my long term stocks ranging from 39% to 167% as I’ve been is a long time. So nothing would be at a loss. I just feel we are facing a man made intentional potential crash of US stocks. Could be short term or long term. One issue, I’m also near retirement age so I don’t have 20 years to wait for a correction. 
Let me further say all my eggs are not in one basket. I’m fully diversified with only 1/3 of my liquid assets in stock. Because of my age 2/3 is in very safe such as CD’s near 5%. Also 2 houses paid off, nice car paid off, zero debt on credit cards paid off monthly. 
But I can’t make a misstep. My portfolio will be 1/2 of the income I will rely on for income in a few years. 


I know we are not supposed to make rash decisions based on “feelings” but it’s more than that, I’m reading nonstop everything about this market and as an older person I feel like I’m seeing a potential 2008 all over again. I wisely went cash then. And in 2010 bought my house for only  42% of it was valued in 2006. Now it’s worth 5 times what I paid for it. 

So anyone who has weathered a few markets, what’s your take? Is cashing out Apple,Amazon,NVDA for instance a crazy move right now? ",28,97,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jhg8n8/honest_question_from_long_term_investor/

News: [London's Heathrow Airport Shut Friday Due To Power Outage](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-21/london-s-heathrow-airport-shut-friday-due-to-power-outage)

Overall, mainly earnings today.

[**NKE (Nike)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NKE&p=d) \- EPS of $0.54 vs. $0.30 expected. Revenue of $11.3B vs. $11.02B expected. Despite beating expectations, sales/profits declined YoY in NA/China/Online. NKE gave a negative earnings outlook, and stated Q4 revenue would decline low-to-mid-teens (10-15%), mainly due to margin pressure from new tariffs. Pretty brutal move. I remember earnings from last year were pretty bad mainly due to weaker demand in China/Online segments. Overall a victim of tariffs, I don't consider this investible for now but things will change if we get any new news regarding tariffs, which are the main headwinds here. IIRC 25% of NKE's shoes are made in China.

[**NIO**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NIO&p=d)**-** Revenue of $2.7B in Q4 2024. Vehicle deliveries rose 45.2% YoY (including Onvo vehicles). Net loss widened to RMB 7.11B, a 32.5% YoY increase. Despite the increase in cars sold, they suffered a loss of \~$1B. They've never been profitable since they've started, so reading a little deeper into their reports, there's still concern about liquidity due to current liabilities being higher than current assets this year (a very bad sign when you want to borrow). They cited EV demand in China remains strong, especially in the premium BEV segment. NIO holds a 40% market share in the $40K-$50K car segment (I'm rounding here after conversion).

[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)**/Quantum Computing stocks**\- Announces that they will be building a quantum lab in Boston. This has moved all the quantum computing stocks to the downside- obviously NVDA has market power in whatever industry they want to enter and compete in and most companies interested in quantum computing will likely prefer their services over the rest of the smaller players. Was the ""quantum computing is a decade away"" comment a brutal play to make the quantum computing sector weaker before his entry? If so, then bravo, that's Game of Thrones worthy scheming.

Operational impact could cause a minor selloff in airlines that have heavy presence there. Nothing too interesting I'm watching, but I think it's worth noting if we see continued slowdowns and ripple effects from this.

2025-03-21 00:54:15,NVIDIA,NVDA,Short sellers have made $15 billion betting against Tesla and Nvidia in 2025,"Short sellers have been cleaning up to start 2025 amid a massive sell-off in some of the market's most popular names over the past two years.

Short sellers have made a combined $15 billion betting against Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) stock thus far this year, according to data from S3 Partners. Tesla shorts alone have raked in nearly $11 billion, while bets against Nvidia have brought in more than $4 billion.

Tesla's 40% year-to-date drop has led the declines of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks. Investors have grown concerned about CEO Elon Musk's focus on government efficiency efforts and how his role with President Trump's administration could be a turnoff to the electric vehicle maker's customer base.

But it hasn't just been Tesla lagging. As an index, the Magnificent Seven — which also includes Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) — is underperforming the S&P 500 this quarter by the most since 2022.

Short sellers have profited off of all of the names in the cohort this year. They've brought in nearly $5 billion betting against Apple stock, which is down nearly 14% in 2025.

The crash in the most popular trade of the past two years comes as investors have been re-rating their growth expectations. Fears of slowing economic growth and the impact of Trump's tariff policies have weighed on markets. Meanwhile, Big Tech has faced growing investor criticism about its ballooning AI spend and whether or not it will eventually boost future profits as much as Wall Street hopes. The year also included a massive drawdown in some large tech names, including Nvidia, following the release of a cheaper AI model from Chinese company DeepSeek.

Now, with most of the names sitting around 20% off their recent 52-week highs, the looming question for markets is whether or not investor appetite for the stocks that led the market higher for the past two years will return.

""Maybe these tech stocks got ahead of their skis a little bit,"" BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski told Yahoo Finance last week. ""But at the end of the day, these are monster companies that define the growth trajectory for the United States stock market. They are not going away.""

Which of these 4 stocks do you think have the best outlook for the future and profits?,"For a while now I've wanted to learn and get more into AI, but I struggle with taking the jump into something new and confusing for me. After hearing the Nvidia GTC keynote I want to get more into AI/data center stocks because I do believe this is a great space for big profits and the future is clearly heading in the direction to utilize these products and services.

  
The 4 stocks that I've been looking at are:

\- Cadence (CDNS)

\- Applied (APLD)

  
I currently invest in mainly all mega cap stocks and dont have much % of my portfolio in AI/data center.

I do have NVDA and AMD at the moment, but pretty small positions.

  
I like the idea of having a few more speculative low cap stock like APLD and I like how NVDA backed them with some funding, which shows me they have some faith in that company. Can get a good amount of shares and hold for a big rally up if the company takes off in the future. Something that I dont need to put a lot of money into which can have a massive increase.

I also like the other 3 because of a few different reasons, but I noticed they had some very large rallies recently, for example NOW.

I liked Cadence because what Jensen said yesterday that they would be looking to hire a lot of designers from Cadence for all their future needs, which makes me believe that company has something special Jensen sees in them.

2025-03-19 05:55:08,NVIDIA,NVDA,Trump’s Trade War 2.0: The Stocks I’m Watching,"With Trump back in office and tariffs returning in full force, I’ve been analyzing what this means for U.S. equities. His latest moves—25% steel and aluminum tariffs, expanded levies on Chinese imports, and a tariff-heavy negotiation strategy—echo his first term but with even **stronger measures**.



While 2018-2020 gave us some clues, the market setup in 2025 is **different**:

• **Higher inflation & rates:** Tariffs add inflationary pressure, making the Fed’s job harder.

• **China’s response will change:** Unlike in 2018, China now **dominates EV battery production** and **controls rare earth supply chains**—this could hurt U.S. tech more than before.

• **Supply chain resilience is mixed:** Companies have talked about reshoring for years, but it’s still expensive and slow.

Given these factors, here’s how I’m positioning:

**Likely Winners:**

1. **Steel & Aluminum (NUE, STLD, CLF)** – Tariffs give them pricing power, though cost inflation is a risk.

2. **Defense & Cybersecurity (LMT, PLTR, CRWD)** – “America First” likely means **higher defense budgets**.

3. **Regional Banks (JPM, BAC, GS)** – If deregulation follows, these should gain.

4. **Domestic Infrastructure (CAT, DE, OSK)** – If tariffs hurt foreign suppliers, U.S. construction demand rises.



**Likely Losers:**

1. **Tech Giants (AAPL, NVDA, QCOM, INTC)** – Heavy China exposure = supply chain and revenue risks.

2. **Consumer Goods (NKE, WMT, DG)** – Imports get pricier, and passing costs to lower-income customers is tough.

3. **Auto & Industrial (TSLA, GM, F, MMM)** – Higher input costs + China retaliation = pain.

4. **Agri Exporters (ADM, TSN, BG)** – If China targets U.S. farm products again, these get hit.



**What I’m watching:**

📌 Will China retaliate with rare earth metal export bans? (Impacts TSLA, NVDA, QCOM)

📌 Do inflation expectations rise, pushing Fed policy hawkish? (Bad for rate-sensitive stocks)

📌 Does Trump backtrack on any tariffs? (A la 2019)

📌 Will domestic manufacturing gains **outweigh** supply chain disruptions?

I’d love to hear counterpoints. Which stocks do you think will **outperform or underperform** in Trump’s Trade War 2.0?",249,187,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jeqaup/trumps_trade_war_20_the_stocks_im_watching/

TSM has proposed a joint venture to Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom to operate Intel's foundry division, with TSM managing the operations but holding less than a 50% stake. We saw INTC make a decent bounce in the overnight yesterday on that news, but it looks like we're giving back most of those gains. This move comes as Intel faces significant losses in its manufacturing division, the CHIPS Act is targeted by Trump, so frankly a very good positive catalyst but I don't expect much to come of this. The possibility of a joint venture between these 4 companies actually happening seems fantastical, especially with Trump stating that he wants to scrap the CHIPS Act and instead work on tariffs on semis. 

[**RDDT (Reddit Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RDDT&p=d)

Loop Capital has maintained a buy rating on Reddit Inc. (RDDT), citing strong core fundamentals and a 71% year-over-year sales growth. I don't normally pay attention to these buy/sell ratings but I did notice this was during one of the worst selloffs for RDDT and the market downturn, so it was *a little* more significant than normal.  The company's stock has experienced a nearly 50% decline from recent highs within the past month. I thought this was interesting yesterday near the open so I bought some stock, overall still holding but interested to see where it goes after the open. Also worth noting, Reddit's plans to monetize its subscriber base are expected to boost revenue (I see them competing with Patreon/Substack/Onlyfans). This is overall a pretty positive catalyst, not much risk to it beyond additional negative news coming in for the broader tech sector.

[**NVDA (Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d) **/** [**GOOG (Alphabet)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GOOG&p=d)

Google has unveiled Gemma 3, a new AI model designed for developers to create applications capable of running efficiently on various devices, including those powered by Nvidia GPUs. I'm also long NVDA a little more- GOOG hasn't pulled back as much as I expected compared to NVDA, but this is pointedly good news. We're also seeing a minor market bounce but whether that can hold is up in the air. Going to sell out if we break new lows in the market. Another model in the arms race that can be run on a SINGLE device is massive news, especially considering the model's competitiveness with Deepseek R1. This is overall positive news but there's always the chance that Deepseek releases an even better model in the future even though the $13M training costs have been debunked. 

**Sidenote:** Initiated a small short position in VXX after it broke above 60 (as mentioned yesterday); however, the primary focus remains on RDDT today.

2025-03-12 12:35:38,NVIDIA,NVDA,"TSMC pitched Intel foundry JV to Nvidia, AMD and Broadcom","TSMC (2330.TW), has pitched U.S. chip designers Nvidia (NVDA.O),, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O), and Broadcom (AVGO.O), about taking stakes in a joint venture that would operate Intel's (INTC.O), factories, according to four sources familiar with the matter.

Under the proposal, the Taiwanese chipmaking giant would run the operations of Intel's foundry division, which makes chips adapted for the needs of customers, but it would not own more than 50%, the sources said. Qualcomm (QCOM.O), has also been pitched by TSMC, according to one of the sources and a separate source.

The talks, which are at an early stage, come after U.S. President Donald Trump's administration requested TSMC, the world's leading contract chipmaker, assist in turning around the troubled U.S. industrial icon, the sources said on condition of anonymity because the talks are not public.

The details of the plan for TSMC to take no more than a 50% stake and its overtures to potential partners are being reported for the first time.

Any final deal - the value of which is unclear - would need approval from the Trump administration, which does not want Intel or its foundry division to be fully foreign-owned, the sources said.

Intel, TSMC, Nvidia, AMD and Qualcomm declined to comment. The White House and Broadcom did not respond to requests for comment.

At stake is the future of the U.S. chipmaking giant, whose shares have lost more than half of their value in the last year.

Intel reported a 2024 net loss of $18.8 billion, its first since 1986, driven by large impairments. The foundry division's property and plant equipment had a book value of $108 billion as of December 31, according to a company filing.

Intel stock rose more than 7% in premarket U.S. trading on Wednesday, while Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom and Qualcomm were up between 0.8% and 1.5%. TSMC closed about 1.8% higher in Taiwan.

Trump is keen to revive Intel's fortunes, as he seeks to boost American advanced manufacturing, three of the sources said.

The sources said TSMC's joint venture pitch was made to potential backers before the Taiwanese chipmaker announced with Trump on March 3 that the company planned to make a fresh $100 billion investment in the United States that involves building five additional chip facilities there in coming years.

Talks about the joint venture over Intel's foundry division have since continued, the three sources said, with TSMC looking to have more than one chip designer as a partner.

Multiple companies have expressed interest in buying parts of Intel, but two of the four sources said the U.S. company has rejected discussions about selling its chip design house separately from the foundry division.

Qualcomm has exited earlier discussions to buy all or part of Intel, according to those people and a separate source.

Intel board members have backed a deal and held negotiations with TSMC, while some executives are firmly opposed, according to two sources.

Intel's contract manufacturing business, or foundry division, was a crucial part of former CEO Pat Gelsinger's effort to save Intel. Gelsinger was forced out by the board in December, which named two interim co-CEOs who have mothballed its forthcoming AI chip.

Any deals between historical rivals TSMC and Intel would face major challenges and be costly and laborious. The two companies currently use vastly different processes, chemicals, and chipmaking tool setups at their factories, according to separate sources at the companies.

Intel has previously had manufacturing partnerships with Taiwan's UMC (2303.TW), and Israel's Tower Semiconductor (TSEM.TA), that could offer a precedent for the two companies to operate together, but it remains unclear how such a partnership would work regarding trade manufacturing secrets.

The Taiwanese chipmaker wants potential investors in the joint venture to also be Intel advanced manufacturing customers, according to one of the sources.

Reuters reported last week, citing sources, that Nvidia and Broadcom are running manufacturing tests with Intel, using the company's most advanced production techniques, known as 18A. AMD is also evaluating whether Intel's 18A manufacturing process is suitable for it.

But 18A has been an area of contention in negotiations between Intel and TSMC, two sources said. During talks in February, Intel executives told TSMC that its advanced 18A manufacturing technology was superior to TSMC's 2-nanometer process, according to those sources.

We had a hell of a selloff yesterday. I see today as an attempt to recover, not too interested in going short on the market today unless we break new lows. Trying out a new layout today.

Saw these move mainly due to recession fears and the entire market panicking, MASSIVE move yesterday.

Yesterday, mainly traded TSLA on the overnight exchanges. It had the largest move and got down to around $212. Overall a lot of negative sentiment ranging from boycotts and Elon controversies. Not too interested in trading TSLA today again.  I'm interested in NVDA if we break below 100 but again I think that we'll mainly see a small bounce today rather than breaking new lows. As for RDDT, we're 50% down from highs! Interesting swing candidate but will see how today goes. To me these are the standout stocks yesterday to trade due to recession fears. I don't really see a way out for TSLA regarding the boycotts. We've also seen a decently large move in the VIX (VXX) and we're close to above 60- I'm interested in shorting if we're above $60 but doubt we'll hit that today.

[**ASAN (Asana)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASAN&p=d)

CEO/co-founder, Dustin Moskovitz announced retirement. The company reported Q4 revenues of $188.3M, a 10% YoY increase, and issued a revenue outlook for fiscal 2026 below expectations (resulting in the drop).

That drop was close to 25%, mainly because Dustin owns close to 54% of the company, which signals a LOT of uncertainty and lack of faith in the company. Overall outlook is decently disappointing, and I'm mainly interested in it if we break $11.50 and very interested in buying $10.

**Ticker:** [**AAL (American Airlines)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAL&p=d)

AAL projected a higher-than-expected Q1 loss and revised its revenue outlook downward, attributing the weaker forecast to softness in the domestic leisure segment. This is probably amplified by fears of flying, mainly due to people being terrified of all the plane accidents that have happened in 2025. Recession fears also lead to people cutting their vacations/discretionary spending and saving money, so things may get worse. Overall we're seeing a slight recovery in the premarket but still watching to see how this trades. To me airlines are one of the bigger leading signals of economic uncertainty so will continue watching.

2025-03-11 09:03:42,NVIDIA,NVDA,Trumps tariffs. Which companies might avoid pain?,"I am hoping to initiate a discussion about specifics here. What companies and industries could suffer the most from from these tariffs. For example a common narrative I am seeing is 

“due too uncertainty companies will halt hiring and due to increased operating costs companies will stop advertising”

Meaning companies like Meta or Reddit will suffer.

But then in the case if companies likes NVDA, the AI front runner. How will tariffs affect the sales of chips? 

Basically if you have a company and a thesis of how it will be specifically positively or negatively by this somewhat extreme environment. 

P.S. You do not need to comment “no one knows for sure” because everyone already knows that. 

The goal here is purely to enjoy ourselves with prediction in just a fun lighthearted way. Let’s try to get at least a little but if joy out of theorising and guessing how this ends.

Jobs report came out premarket, overall expect a small recovery today.

News: [Us Employment Report For February](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2025-03-07/us-employment-report-for-february)

**Ticker:** [**AVGO (Broadcom)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AVGO&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Earnings. Reported EPS of $1.60 vs. $1.49 exp, revenue of $14.92B vs. $14.61B expected. AVGO gave strong guidance of $14.9B vs $14.76B. Cited strong growth due to AI chips and/infrastructure components for training AI.

**Technicals:** Watching to see if we break $200 level today.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** I think we're seeing the AI hype become more concentrated in the ""winners"" of the AI race now. There are some companies that ARE citing falling demand for their AI related products while others are stating that demand is still robust. Likely going to see greater consolidation in the future. Major chipmakers like Broadcom are benefiting from hyperscaler investments in AI over the 3 year AI boom.

**Risks:** Tariffs/supply chain constraints make the supply chain far more tenuous.

**Related Tickers:** NVDA, AMD, QCOM, all other semiconductor stocks

**Ticker:** [**LUNR (Intuitive Machines)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=LUNR&p=d)

**Catalyst:** LUNR’s uncrewed Nova-C lander, Athena, encountered challenges upon landing on the Moon. (Something to do with their lunar lander not landing at the correct angle, I'm no rocket scientist.)

**Technicals:** LUNR sold off close to 40% yesterday, watching to see if we break the lows at $6.70 premarket. We had 3 major spikes (2 went to the lower) and I'm interested in seeing if we can make any form of recovery today.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** These exploratory spaceflight companies are insanely volatile and depend on their spaceflights doing well- as seen yesterday.

**Risks:** Technical malfunctions could impact investor confidence and future funding. Delays in future missions or failures in securing government contracts could also hinder growth.

**Related Tickers:** ASTS, RKLB

**Ticker:** [**WBA (Walgreens)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=WBA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** WBA has agreed to a \~$10B deal with Sycamore Partners to take the company private. Deal is $11.45/shr in cash.

**Technicals:** We saw a strong spike from 10.60 -> 11.20 after the news.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Buyout play, but obviously there's not much reward left on this catalyst.

**Risks:** Deal could get cancelled, more delays, regulatory scrutiny, etc.

**Ticker:** [**HPE (Hewlett Packard Enterprise)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HPE&p=d)

**Catalyst:** EPS of $0.49 vs. $0.49 expected. Revenue of $7.85B vs. $7.82B expected. HPE’s results were in line with expectations but they cited profit next year would be hurt by tariffs and had weak margins on server sales. Stated IT products from China and Mexico would affect the company’s outlook.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The IT hardware sector is facing supply chain disruptions and rising production costs due to tariff outlook. Easy rule of thumb: the more complex the product (advanced electronics), the more affected by tariffs they are.

Today is mostly related to Trump's speech yesterday. Secretary Lutnick announced yesterday ""Tariffs compromise announcement will likely come tomorrow"", so will be on the lookout for that.

**Catalyst:** Trump has called for an end to the CHIPS Act Subsidy Program (instead preferring tariffs).

**Technicals:** Short biased. Obviously this takes away a lot of investment in semis companies. Extremely negative catalyst but unlikely it will get repealed due to how much bipartisan support it had.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The CHIPS and Science Act gave $280B in new funding to boost domestic research/manufacturing of semis in the US, and also aimed to strengthen supply chain resilience against China and widely considered to be a success because it spurred the development/dominance in the semis sector in America.

**Risks:** If this gets repealed, we're likely going to see a pretty large pullback in the semis. Obviously this is dependent on what the tariffs Trump touts will do as well. [I wrote a little more about my take on a different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j437g9/trump_calls_for_end_to_52_billion_chips_act/) but overall more of the same (I think it's a terrible idea).

**Catalyst:** The Trump administration is considering granting relief from the recently imposed 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports for products that comply with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).

**Technicals:** We've seen all three stocks (GM especially) make gains due to this announcement, will watch at open for volume.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The automotive industry in US/Canada/Mexico involves the most economic/manufacturing cooperation in the USMCA, they're the most obvious beneficiaries of this potential catalyst.

**Risks:** If they don't actually give relief, then will likely pullback- cars are one of the most affected products of tariffs and pretty much every car company has spoken about tariffs on their earnings calls.

**Catalyst:** Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has indicated that Trump plans to grant the main biggest CC a ""unique status"" within the Bitcoin reserve strategy, which will be unveiled at the White House Crypto Summit on Friday.

**Technicals:** We've seen the underlying spike close to 8-9% since yesterday, watching $90K level. Interested to see how we go prior to the actual summit.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Obviously an extremely bullish catalyst, we've bounced strongly off the $80K level recently. I usually trade through the ETFs as needed, and HOOD/Coinbase serve as proxies in case the ETFs aren't liquid or have already moved.

**Risks:** Worth waiting for the catalyst and watching the CC Summit on Friday. I personally see this more of a ""buy on hype"" kind of catalyst, unless there's an announcement of something extremely bullish I'm not sure how much more this will move the needle.

**Ticker:** [**HII (Huntington Ingalls Industries)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HII&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Trump has announced initiatives aimed at strengthening the U.S. shipbuilding industry to counter China's dominance, spoke about the creation of a White House Office of Shipbuilding and the introduction of special tax incentives.

**Technicals:** None that I'm particularly interested in, this is a longer-term play.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** China produces over half of the world's merchant vessels, this is more of a play to reduce reliance on foreign-shipping.

**Risks:** There's a chance that this will never happen, Trump tried to create a ""Cybersecurity Department"" in his first term but that was never formally created and we kept those duties spread out between the FBI/DHS/NSA. But we also have the Space Force so... stay tuned.

**Technicals:** Overall a brutal delivery report. TSLA has been on a slide since post-election highs and frankly shows no real sign of recovery. Looking for a small bounce in this stock but I don't think there is much potential for long-term recovery.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** TSLA's EV sales have been declining in China mainly due to BYD, which are considered to make better cars for far cheaper outside the US. The US has a 100% EV tariff for non-US made EV vehicles.

**Catalyst:** Okta beat earnings expectations with EPS of $.78 vs $.74,gave guidance that supports EPS of $3.20 vs $2.93. (Also note that CRWD reports today but are not direct competitors)

**Technicals:** Watching $100 level.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Cybersecurity (more specifically IAM) grows yearly mainly due to RPO and cRPO (remaining performance obligations). This is subscription backlog expected to be recognized over the next 12 months.

**Risks:** Market saturation/pricing concerns from competitors.

**Ticker:** [**NVDA (Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Nvidia is front and center as the stock most affected by tariff concerns.

**Technicals:** Watching $110 level. Note that this is the lowest it's been since September 2024. We have millions of shares come in in the first 2 minutes of the open so watch for that.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Not much to speak of that hasn't been said before, but NVDA is heavily affected by tariffs and the CHIPS Act, with additional scrutiny that it is somehow bypassing export controls and having their chips go into China.

**Risks:** MORE trade disputes, more potential export restrictions, (Trump has cited he wants to strengthen export controls for NVDA).

**Catalyst:** China has imposed 15% retaliatory tariffs on select U.S. goods.

**Technicals:** $130 level. Most interesting level I'm watching today.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Tariffs, stimulus from the Chinese government, China has been spending for increased consumer confidence. 

**Risks:** Even greater tariffs, the cash cannon that China is using dies down, less spending by Chinese consumers, etc.

2025-03-03 13:42:42,NVIDIA,NVDA,Will US-Ukraine Split will trigger Chinese invasion of Taiwan (TSM/NVDA related),"There's at least two possibilities: 

* Our divestment from Ukraine will give us more resources to deal with China militarily; or
* We're actually signaling to China that we are not interested in defending other countries.

Chinese invasion of Taiwan is always on the table, but some people think what happened on Friday at the White House has just raised that possibility dramatically.

For example, Cramer wrote an article over the weekend for his paid community where he said: 

* ""If I was Chinese President Xi Jinping, I would immediately move militarily on Taiwan, betting that President Trump may switch sides and back China.""

* ""If you disagree with that after Friday’s White House exchange with Zelenskyy, you need to soul search your position. To me, this could be a tremendous opportunity for the PRC to stop this whole game of export restrictions from the U.S. and just turn everything on its head by taking over the island and, along with it, the most important strategic asset in the world right now, Taiwan Semi.""

* ""In a world where Zelenskyy gets thrown under the bus for lack of gratitude and starting a war that he didn’t start, how can we defend an allegedly ungrateful Taiwan? Perhaps because, unlike Ukraine, there is something at stake economically?""

* ""Will President Trump’s advisers discuss the notion that if we care about keeping the Chinese from getting the latest and greatest Nvidia chips, we should care about Taiwan’s sovereignty? Will Trump be persuaded by even cowed generals and naïve national security advisers that Nvidia and Taiwan Semi are of strategic importance? Do they even know that?""

Of course Cramer is an entertainer and not a military strategist. But I'm curious what does the community think. Is the American handling of Ukraine increasing or decreasing China's resolve to invade Taiwan soon? Would you change your investment strategy based on your analysis?",154,270,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j2ixfl/will_usukraine_split_will_trigger_chinese/
2025-03-01 16:48:24,NVIDIA,NVDA,What’s the stock you regret NOT buying the most?,"For me it's an easy pick, NVDA. 

Working in software engineering and having studied it, NVDA was massively hyped in engineering circles before the AI hype. I was researching it in 2020 and decided not to pull the trigger since I couldn't completely understand the long term business model. Oh well. 

It sticks out to me the most since I understood the technical MOAT but did not want to take the risk. Hindsight is 20/20.

Is there any stock that particularly stands out for you? ",505,732,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j13sp1/whats_the_stock_you_regret_not_buying_the_most/
2025-02-28 01:40:53,NVIDIA,NVDA,Contrarian view (bullish on the market - especially tech stocks),"So I am thinking more and more about this market and so much of the negativity is due to the Trump tweet (or “truth”) of the day where he’s either amplifying his tariff talk or threatening one of our allies. The market overreacts and sells off great companies (e.g. NVDA today). But here’s what I think will happen:

Trump will announce that he’s come to a “beautiful, glorious deal” with the EU, Canada, Mexico, etc. and talk about reducing the tariffs that both sides charge each other. This will make the market POP big time because it will promote free trade. It will be especially good for US technology companies who have been hectored by the EU and outright banned or censored in parts of Asia.

Trump will then work with Xi to create a better trade situation with China in the second half of 2025, where our technology companies IP are protected and the Chinese manufacturing sector is also protected (there’s a reason that 30% of the US’ good are produced in China). He will also relax the export restrictions on US technology, allowing companies like Nvidia and MU to sell the Hell out of China, which will lead to a big pop again. 

Let’s face it, Trump has a huge ego. He’s not going to allow the stock market to tank in his first year. He ESPECIALLY is not going to allow it to tank tech stocks, where is he leaning so heavily on technology people like Musk, David Sacks and Peter Thiel. He even has a great relationship with Jensen Huang now. 

That’s my theory. I think it will remain choppy for the next couple of quarters but by Q3 CY2025, things should be rocking and rolling. I am DCAing BIG TIME into some great stocks in the AI and energy sector until then, while the prices are still relatively attractive.

2025-02-27 15:13:55,NVIDIA,NVDA,Reddit picks winners!,"Year after year Reddit picks the winners! I have kept a close eye on this subreddit for the last 10-15 years and have always been amazed by how ahead of the curve we are. Here is a list of stocks that have been heavily discussed over the years that have performed very well: 

- Tesla 
- Shopify 
- Block
- NVDA 
- AMD 
- PLTR
- AAPL 
- GME

I know everyone in the comments is going to claim this is selection bias, but I can assure you these stocks were talked about so much it is unmistakable. People will also claim but these stocks have tanked since then! They have had significant corrections, but if you bought them when the buzz began you are still significantly in the green.  We will have to wait and see what the future holds. 

 But what about the losers like movie pass!? Of course, some losers have been overly hyped too, but they are far less common. Also, in my opinion, the tone around stocks like movie pass is totally different than a stock like NVDA or SHOP. 

The beautiful part about Reddit is you hear both sides, SHOP had a great deal of resistance back in 2017 and still does. A lot of people claimed it was a worthless company. People like Andrew Left were worshipped for shorting the company. But at the end of the day it was posted about non stop and has performed extremely well. People were also screaming from the top of the mountain that NVDA was overpriced in 2017, look where that ended up. 

Lately it feels like we have entered a new “hype” cycle where a lot of new names have been heavily mentioned. Similar to the hype cycle of 2016-2017 there is a lot of resistance and great discussions behind had. Here are some new names that I have noticed being posted about non stop: 

- RKLB
- IONQ 
- BBAI
- CAVA 
- LUNR
- SMCI
- OKLO 
- BRO

I have been seeing these tickers fly around lately and see a lot of promise in them. They have performed very well in the past 6 months to a year, but we will have to wait and see where they end up in the long term. 

It’s a common meme to short every stock Reddit mentions, but I ultimately disagree. The hive mind is a very powerful and can seemingly predict the future. Keep in mind, the hive mind is what sets the vegas spreads. 

Anyway, that’s my rant for the day. I am sure 75% of you will disagree with me, but again, thats why I love Reddit. Would love to hear your opinions. 

Also, I have holdings in most of the companies listed. This is not financial advice. Do your own due diligence before buying any company I listed. ",0,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1izi0k0/reddit_picks_winners/
2025-02-27 14:37:05,NVIDIA,NVDA,Why is my call option down further when the stock price is up?,"Just looking for some help in understanding this because it doesn't make sense to me at all.

I bought an NVDA call option earlier this week at a $140 strike, expiry 2/28. It's been down and my option was around 2.2, I believe. Then earnings hit and I see during after hours and at market open, NVDA is up yet my option price is down further than the previous day when NVDA was hovering around 129-130.

Not sure what I'm missing here. I'm fairly new to options, as you can tell so any advice would be appreciated.

News: [Nvidia Gives Upbeat Forecast In Sign That AI Build Out Is Strong](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-26/nvidia-gives-upbeat-forecast-in-sign-that-ai-build-out-is-strong)

**Ticker:** [**NVDA (Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Reported earnings with EPS of $0.89 vs. $0.84 exp and revenue of $39.33B vs. $38.05B exp.

Provided strong guidance, anticipating revenue of $43B vs  $41.78B exp.

Performance is driven by robust demand for Nvidia's Blackwell AI chips, positioning the company to maintain its growth trajectory in the AI sector.

Overall a good earnings report, we're not going to see the stock explode like we did previously with the earnings beats.

**Technicals:** Watching $135 level, other than that I don't anticipate a major selloff due to the earnings news- maybe due to the jobs/macro news instead.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Overall not as explosive as the market wanted it to be. Growth was largely driven by advancements in AI (as usual).

Company said they were still demand constrained, even with export controls.

**Risks:** Potential supply chain disruptions/geopolitical tensions, greater export controls as mentioned previously, and increased competition.

**Related Tickers:** AMD, INTC, QCOM

**Ticker:** [**APP (AppLovin)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=APP&p=d)

**Catalyst:** A recent short report has been released, alleging that the company's application functions as spyware.

This follows a similar report from approximately a week ago.

**Technicals:** Yesterday I was mainly interested in being long if we broke $300 and had a recovery- I read both of the short reports and they said very similar things, so I thought the selloff was overblown.

Bought a little below $290, still holding. Will likely bail if we break $300 again.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** APP is a mobile tech company that helps devs market/monetize their apps through mobile advertising and marketing platforms, recently announced they were using AI.

**Risks:** The short report allegations are true and they essentially get banned from the Google App/Apple App Store.

**Related Tickers:** SNAP, PINS, TTD

**Ticker:** [**MRNA (Moderna)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MRNA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** U.S. health officials are reevaluating a $590 million contract awarded to MRNA for bird flu vaccines.

**Technicals:** We saw a decent dip (roughly 5%) in MRNA afterhours yesterday, not too interested in this further unless we see further headlines about the contract being pulled completely.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** MRNA had massive growth during 2020 for being one of the main manufacturers of the COVID vaccine- right now bird flu is being touted as the next potential big pandemic to vaccinate against.

**Risks:** Cancellation is the the real catalyst after this news, or if the contract is awarded to a different company.

**Related Tickers:** PFE, NVAX

**Ticker:** [**SNOW (Snowflake)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SNOW&p=d)

**Catalyst:** SNOW beat expectations, EPS of $0.30 vs. $0.18 exp. and revenue of $986.8M vs. $957.6M exp.

The company also provided an optimistic outlook, projecting current-quarter product revenue between $955M-$960M, driven by increasing demand for AI-related products.

**Technicals:** Interested in $190 level.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** SNOW is a cloud-based data warehousing company and benefits from the demand for AI/ML solutions.

AI is compute intensive which means they can charge more for their services. Also announced integration with Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service.

**Risks:** SNOW doesn't generate GAAP profits still, data breaches, competitors, etc.

* **Earnings per share**: $0.89 adjusted vs. $0.84 estimated

The market was down like 25% at the end of 2022, there was fear every single day here. People were screaming about shorting SPY down to 300. The 10 year yield had an inverted curve, which is suppose to almost guarantee a recession. We had negative GDP growth for two quarters but for some reason, it was not listed as a recession. 

Everyone thought 2023 was going to be even worse. Then this nifty little tool called ChatGPT became mainstream and saved the world. I remember people posting “I asked chatGPT X” threads on Reddit at the end of 2022 and everyone being absolutely perplexed. Stocks like $NVDA started blasting off to orbit around spring 2023.

**Catalyst:** Some catalysts today: Deepseek cuts API pricing by 75%, NVDA is reporting earnings, ChatGPT is doing a limited rollout of ChatGPT 4.5, META considering $200B AI data center.

NVDA reporting earnings is the main catalyst today and decides the immediate direction of the market.

**Technicals:** Mainly interested in seeing if NVDA misses revenue (unlikely) or if they say anything significant due to new export controls which I talked about yesterday (strengthening of CHIPS Act export controls to China).

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** NVDA leads in semis design, is a multi-billion dollar company, etc.

**Risks:** I'm currently positioned defensively (sold calls against my position since I have a decent cost basis from back when DeepSeek news released, so overall will just sit on hands and get out of my position if the earnings are bad).

**Technicals:** Massive selloff since post-election highs- $300 was a significant level I was watching at the time and we exploded past that, so interested to see if we're able to hold above it.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** BYD is a major competitor to TSLA and will likely overtake them in the future, and Musk's political actions are seen as controversial in Europe.

**Risks:** Musk.

**Catalyst:** The CC market is experiencing a selloff mainly due to proposed tariffs and the hack at Bybit, resulting in the loss of \~$1.5 billion.

**Technicals:** Not too interested in playing this long- still watching to see how we perform but the sell off has continued, waiting for a larger move still.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Hacks increase fear of storing on centralized exchanges (like Coinbase), proposed tariffs affecting digital assets can lead to market volatility. Interestingly enough, ByBit was (theorized) to be hacked by North Korea.

**Catalyst:** China plans to inject at least $55 billion into its largest banks in the coming months as part of a broader stimulus package, Yuan printer go brrrrr. This move is intended to supplement the core Tier 1 capital of China’s six largest state-owned banks. This is the first bank recapitalization since the global financial crisis. 10T yuan (\~$1.4T) debt package to support local government financing and economic stability.

**Technicals:** We've seen a decent upmove on a lot of Chinese stocks due to this, we'll see how the market reacts.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** China has been going through a spending crisis, and the government's decision to inject substantial capital into its major banks is a move to strengthen liquidity. This initiative aims to enhance the lending capacity of banks, support local government financing, and stabilize the broader economy. It's a (pre) bailout baby.

**Risks:** This does signal that China sees economic weakness, such as lack of demand due to their real estate sector they've traditionally leaned on for consumer growth/investment. Is this a long term fix? Who knows, but it worked for the US!

**Related Tickers:** JD, BIDU

**Ticker: SMCI**

**Catalyst:** They finally filed an hour before the deadline on the final day! Really cutting it close there lol. The company has faced allegations of accounting irregularities. These allegations, along with a failure to file specific financial forms have been a plague for the past year on the stock price. 

**Technicals:** We've seen a 20% move AH, so worth watching at open to see if we move further. Other than that, watching $50/$55 level. We'll see where it goes but worth noting that we've made a significant move back to pre-delisting threat prices already.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Was at threat of delisting from the NASDAQ but now they're safe baby.

**Risks:** People getting out, or the filing being rejected/advised to resubmit. The latter is a massive catalyst but low probability.

**Catalyst:** The Trump administration is planning to strengthen semiconductor export controls to China, aiming to strengthen the CHIPS act from Biden's term.

Additionally, DeepSeek is accelerating the release of its new AI model, R2, following the success of its R1 model. (Most of their training is done on NVDA chips)

**Technicals:** Mainly interested to see if we can hold above $130 for NVDA- note that earnings are tomorrow so the short-term performance of the stock hinges on that. Currently long and sold 155C to hedge my position against it.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** We've seen the CHIPS act actually affect the way that semiconductor companies sell to China- most of those restrictions are bypassed, so this strengthening of export controls might actually affect the industry.

**Risks:** More export controls may lead to China giving tariffs in retaliation- but again, most semis are supply constrained rather than demand constrained so I don't see it as a significant catalyst until more details are released.

**Catalyst:** BABA has introduced its own AI reasoning model within the Qwen framework (like how META has the Llama framework), while we have a surge of all Chinese stock performance following the Chinese government's announcement of liquidity measures.

**Technicals:** It seems as if we've peaked (BABA has gone up close to 50% since the start of this month) for most Chinese stocks in the past few days, I would be interested in being short but I was on vacation this weekend. Interested in shorting BABA specifically if we make another large up move like we did on 2/20.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** BABA is one of the major competitors that is working on AI models, and is notably using NVDA cards to train its models. 

**Risks:** Mainly tariff news and news from other rivals with better models. Straightforward.

**Catalyst:** Previously, PLTR faced concerns due to defense budget cuts and CEO Alex Karp reducing his stake in the company. We've seen it make a massive run from retail and fall just as quickly.

**Technicals:** Interested in playing a small bounce- we're up \~10% since last earnings report (and pre-crazy move), there is potential for a small bounce here but only entering a small position since it looks like we bottomed early premarket today. 

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Trump directed the government to make significant cuts to the defense budget. (This is a far more significant catalyst than Alex Karp selling shares)

**Risks:** PLTR lives and dies on defense contract money, so obviously further cuts/expansions will affect stock price.

**Catalyst:** The CC market is experiencing heightened volatility due to proposed tariffs and a significant security breach at Bybit, resulting in the loss of approximately $1.5 billion.

**Technicals:** Not too interested in playing this long- still watching to see how we perform but the sell off resulting in the biggest Coin going to $90K has me watching the stock related proxies that deal with the market. 

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** CC platforms are highly susceptible to regulatory changes and security incidents.

Proposed tariffs affecting digital assets can lead to market vol, while large-scale hacks undermine investor trust and lead to sell-offs in the market as it spreads fear and people wanting to cash out.

**Risks:** Regulatory interventions impose additional compliance costs and operational constraints on CC exchanges.

Security breaches not only result in financial losses but also lead to decreased user adoption and revenue.

2025-02-23 16:54:56,NVIDIA,NVDA,Nvidia Suppliers Send Mixed Signals for Delays on GB200 Systems – What It Means for NVDA Stock,"Recently Analyst Beth Kindig, a bullish analyst, put out an interesting newsletter that was surprisingly bearish on Nvidia due to their supplier commentary. Earnings on Wednesday should be very interesting. Here’s a consolidated copy

Super Micro Lowers FY25 Revenue Guide, Pushes Back 30% Liquid Cooling Target


Super Micro recently reported preliminary fiscal Q2 results, in which it cut its fiscal 2025 revenue guide while hinting that Blackwell GPUs could take longer to ramp in the first part of the calendar year.

At Computex in June 2024, CEO Charles Liang stated that he “expects 15 percent of racks [SMCI] sells this year to use DLC, and 30 percent to employ it [in 2025].” In August 2024,  Liang slightly changed his tune, noting that they now expect “25% to 30% of the new global datacenter deployments to use DLC solutions in the next 12 months.”

I remember this comment well, as it was part of the evidence used to debunk the August rumors considering SMCI had moved up their timeline for DLC delivery (from end of year 2025 to mid-year 2025).

Two weeks ago in the February 2025 report, this timeline was shifted back with Liang stating that Super Micro now believes that “DLC or overall liquid cooling market share will grow all the way to 30% or even more in the next 12 months” -- it’s not a dramatic shift in tone but rather pushes the 30% target back from mid-year 2025 noted in August, to beyond the original year-end timeline --- to now technically being early 2026.

The August earnings call also housed one critical piece of information regarding Blackwell and Super Micro’s 2025 revenue. Wells Fargo’s Aaron Rakers questioned management about Blackwell and guidance for December 2024 and onwards. Liang explained that for the December quarter, Blackwell “will be very small. Engineering sample small volume. So the real volume, I believe, had to be March quarter next year. And that's why we foresee only $26 billion to $30 billion.”

But now, SMCI implied they are not able to ship Blackwell in the March quarter:

Super Micro has walked back the revenue guide that hinged on Blackwell’s NVL systems shipping in volume in the March quarter. Management was also quite clear that the new product was facing a delay as they await more GPU supply.

Vertiv Signals Softer Q1


Vertiv is a provider of thermal and power management solutions and is a leader in direct liquid cooling. The company stated they benefited from a “particularly strong” Q4, with revenue rising nearly 26% YoY as they overdelivered by nearly $200 million as customers wanted products as soon as possible.

Vertiv’s strength in Q4 may be tied to key partner Dell, as its AI server backlog in fiscal Q3 (October quarter) rose more than 18% QoQ to $4.5 billion after being flat QoQ in Q2, and its AI pipeline rising more than 50% QoQ. Analysts placed Dell’s AI server pipeline at $16 to $17 billion, up from $11 to $13 billion previously, a rather large jump for one quarter. However, Dell noted that one factor for its softer Q4 and fiscal year guide was the “unpredictability of the AI shipments” as there are “some more timing differences than what we were anticipating when we gave the guide the last quarter.”

For Q1, Vertiv guided a deceleration to 19% YoY growth, with FY25 revenue growth guided at 16%. Management defended this deceleration into Q1 by saying: “Now of course, Q4 was particularly strong. So we should not look at Q1 as a quarter-to-quarter, really look at the first quarter sales as the acceleration that has taken place. With a 19% organic growth in the first quarter, I feel very, very good about what that tells us about our overall trajectory” and also that it is “higher than what we actually saw in 2024.”

Liquid cooling capacity is not a constraint for Vertiv, as they had said last summer that they were “on track to finish in 2024 with a 45x capacity increase compared to baseline at the end of 2023.”

I agree with the analyst sentiment (and weak price action) following the report that the commentary doesn’t check out exactly. management is contradicting itself by guiding for organic growth of 19% at the midpoint for Q1 but 16% growth for the fiscal year (i.e., slower growth later in the year) while stating shipments will increase QoQ.

Additionally, the QoQ/YoY has to be looked at which is lower than what typical seasonality would account for, as our numbers indicate Vertiv was down (12.1%) due to seasonal sequential growth from Q4-Q1. This year, Vertiv is down (16.9%) from Q4-Q1.

My conclusion (still to be confirmed) is that Vertiv may see a weak Q2 before there is an acceleration into the back half.


Networking Companies Shift Tone on Timing for GB200s


PCIe 6.0 supplier:

PCIe 6.0 is a networking standard expected to initially ship with Nvidia’s Blackwell. A key supplier stated to expect this in the second half of the year, as these products “are driving higher dollar content opportunities [...] on a full rack and full accelerator basis and we expect volume deployments to begin in the second half of this year.”

Revealed at GTC in March of 2024, PCIe 6.0 was initially expected to launch with the GB200s. The following quote from this supplier also hints that merchant GPUs (Nvidia) will not be driving H1 – which would be odd if Blackwell was shipping. “Now, if you look into 2025, we see both contributing growth. The first half of the year will be more predominantly the internal AI accelerator programs. But if you get into the back half of the year, the transition on the merchant GPUs will also be very strong for us. This is where you'll see the custom rack configurations start to deploy and that’s where we see a big dollar increase in our contemporary GPU with [our product] starting to ramp.”

PMIC Suppliers:

PMICs (power management integrated circuits) are a critical part of the picture for Blackwell, given that these components were linked to Blackwell’s rumored power management issues. Major PMIC suppliers were unable to confirm volume shipments in the first quarter in recent earnings calls.

One PMIC supplier that we covered on our Advanced site on Feb 5th, is stating that “We know that we're not the only one players going after this, so the share is still to be determined. The final design, everything is still to be finalized as well, too. So we're working closely with the customer. Again, at this point, we can say that we're targeting for a mid-year launch.”

This company is either discussing Blackwell Ultra with the B300s, or they are implying GB200s are delayed.

The competing PMIC supplier stated: “Just to add a little bit of color to how we see the year rolling out, we believe that we will be off to a slower start in the first half of the year. But as the year develops, the customer base is expected to broaden as hyperscalers launch their new products. We have multiple product ramps with both existing customers as well as with these new hyperscalers.”

The takeaway is that neither PMIC supplier can confirm they are shipping in volume in Q1 or Q2, yet meanwhile, both are saying they are still part of the supply chain.

Semtech Suddenly Pulls Guidance on Active Copper Cabling (ACCs)


Perhaps the most drastic commentary to come out of the last few weeks was when a key supplier pulled its Q1 guidance intra-quarter.

Semtech filed an 8-K stating that “net sales from its CopperEdge products used in active copper cables are expected to be lower than the Company’s previously disclosed floor case estimate of $50 million due to rack architecture changes, with no expected ramp-up over the course of fiscal year 2026.”

ACC content had been estimated to be substantially higher with 36x2 configurations – it had been rumored back in October 2024 that Nvidia was halting development of one of the NVL72 configurations, the NVL36x2, which linked two 36 GPU racks together in a side-by-side system. Semtech pulling guidance strengthens this view.

The shift in architecture to discontinue the 36x2 configuration was said to possibly “disrupt the supply chain for assembly and cooling solutions,” by removing dual-rack configurations and focusing solely on single-rack NVL72 and NVL36 configurations. DLC suppliers have been pushing back Blackwell’s ramp later in the year, suggesting that the market may have faced some impacts from this rumored design change late last year.

While shifting architectures is not a big deal in the medium-term (as stated above, NVL72 single rack configurations are expected to see a higher mix); it’s the suddenness that Semtech pulled it’s guidance that is cause for concern as the company had reaffirmed its optimistic revenue floor guidance  based on two factors – the timing of Blackwell’s launch and changes in rack design. This suggests both factors may be in play, as a late-stage design change was expected to have downstream impacts on timing for DLC ramping.

Conclusion:
Given market jitters around DeepSeek, which turned out to be a non-issue, something more material related to the GB200s, such as growth slowing below expectations at the start of the new fiscal year, could send the stock below $100 -- which we would see as a buying opportunity.

There is a scenario where Nvidia’s stock marches higher – perhaps based on the remaining strength from Hopper and the B200s, B200 HGX systems and B200As packaged with CoWoS-S and having a lower thermal design power (TDP). Or perhaps the string of suppliers discussed here are simply stating the GB200s are not ramping in volume in Q1 but will in Q2.",125,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iweku5/nvidia_suppliers_send_mixed_signals_for_delays_on/

Palantir has been on a tear recently, all hyped up on the defense sector growth but no one is really paying attention to Meta Defense and their entry to the space. Last year Meta opened up its AI models to defense agencies and contractors. This is huge for them to get this level of clearance and i think this will will put them in direct competition with Palantir. Im not sure how they build out this branch of Meta, Im calling it Meta Defense but they fired all their woke people and are starting to re-shape the company.

Yes, there is defense spending cuts but its all on waste and overcharged contracts not on things that actually matter for the dept of defense. During the inauguration Zuckerberg was in the front row, Hegseth was somewhere in the back. Just an observation.

Everyone is familiar with their social media business so there isnt a whole lot to talk about there. AI keeps improving, More growth from Reels, Threads, Facebook. Their LLM is impressive and arguably one of the best, putting them up there with OpenAI.

With all there user data they have Meta Analytics could be another source of revenue.

They are sitting on a goldmine with Facebook market place. i get they have ads but i feel they could do more.  Im not sure Zuckerberg realized what he has there but this business if monetized right could be HUGE.

Most interesting news today is the hope that the meeting between Russian/US officials may end the three-year war in Ukraine, in addition to release of the Grok-3 model from xAI (Elon Musk's AI startup.)

News: [Musk S Xai Debuts Grok 3 Ai Bot Touting Benchmark Superiority](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-18/musk-s-xai-debuts-grok-3-ai-bot-touting-benchmark-superiority)

**Ticker:** [**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)/[**SMH**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SMH&p=d)/every semis and AI facing stock

**Catalyst:** Elon Musk's AI startup, xAI, has unveiled its latest model, Grok-3, claiming it surpasses competitors like GPT-4o, Google Gemini, DeepSeek V3, and Claude.

These assertions have not been independently verified by the open sourcen community but it wouldn't be surprising if it could surpass 4o (the model is close to a year old now)

**Technicals:** No real level I've been watching in NVDA, SMH, already positioned long. Note that xAI uses NVDA GPU's specifically in their super computer.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** We've seen a very strong recovery since the Deepseek fears caused a selloff. Personally I don't think xAI will cause the same effect that Deepseek did, but I think that the semis are a winner of this again.

**Risks:** Unverified performance claims may lead to skepticism among investors and potential customers, impacting adoption rates and market trust. XAI has a “Colossus supercomputer,” for training AI, which it said last year was utilizing a cluster of 100,000 advanced Nvidia GPUs for AI training.

Today, the company revealed that it doubled the size of its GPU cluster for the training of Grok 3.

**Offhand Comments:** May see reversal of news if performance doesn't match claims.

**Ticker:** [**HEES (Herc Holdings Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HEES&p=d)

**Catalyst:** HEES has confirmed a $105 per share acquisition offer from Herc Rentals, surpassing the previous $92 per share bid from United Rentals.

**Technicals:** Watching $100 level. They've accepted the bid so we might see trading closer to that bid price in the near future.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Equipment rental industry is witnessing consolidation due to decelerating growth since 2023 (other than that nothing explosive)

**Risks:** The bidding war may escalate acquisition costs, potentially leading to overvaluation and financial strain for the acquiring company.

**Technicals:** Watching $75 level.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** SKIMS is pretty popular- mainly does underwear/loungewear/shapewear but this might be more focused on athleisure. This could potentially make a difference in NKE sales- SKIMS also collaborated with The North Face in the past, so worth keeping track of this for future catalysts in case they work with other brands.

**Catalyst:** Unconfirmed reports suggest that President Trump plans to demand $500 billion from Ukraine and seek U.S. control over the country's mineral resources.

These claims have not been reported by major U.S. news outlets but have appeared in international media (from India, Canada, UK)

**Technicals:** This catalyst has been ""semi-leaked"" for the past week but not ""fully confirmed"", but we would likely see a selloff in defense stocks if true.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** These companies would go to the downside from an end to the Ukraine war, and spike if talks aren't successful.

**Risks:** Pretty much a ""wait for the news announcement"" kind of trade, pretty straightforward.

The company noted a 178% quarter-over-quarter increase in external API calls for its ERNIE AI bot and expects its AI investments to deliver more significant results in 2025.

Additionally, Apollo Go has commenced 100% fully driverless operations across China since February.

  
**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The technology sector is rapidly advancing in AI and autonomous driving technologies. Something interesting over the weekend was Xi meeting with private sector business leaders, signaling that China would be more friendly to business leaders (like Jack Ma)  
  
**Risks:** It's China.

**Catalyst:** Elliott Management has increased its stake in Phillips 66 to over $2.5 billion, advocating for operational changes to enhance shareholder value. Elliott is believed to push the company to spin off or sell midstream opportunities.

**Technicals:** We made a 6% move (just like when Elliott took a stake in BP), we may see another leg of movement during the day.

**Risks:** Spinning off a segment reduces income diversification (at the possible benefit of having a higher valuation multiple), more of a long-term investment risk than a short term one. In the short-term, expect a ton of marginal headlines that will move the stock up/down 1% depending on how they want to make changes.

**Technicals:** Watching $65 level to the upside. Overall not interested in shorting this if I had to take a position.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The semiconductor industry is signaling increased demand and increased spending across all companies, which is bullish obviously. Despite slightly missing EPS they signaled a good enough outlook that the stock reacted positively to Earnings. LSCC makes low power FPGAs.

**Catalyst:** Following TMUS's announcement of compatibility with Starlink Beta, ASTS (a close competitor) experienced an 18% increase, with potential for further movement (both upside/downside) today, particularly around the $30 level.

**Technicals:** I'm leaning more towards pullback today, watching $30 level.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The satellite communications industry is rapidly evolving, with major players forming partnerships to expand global connectivity. Starlink is the biggest company out there, but ASTS moves whenever adoption news comes out, like it did previously with Verizon.

**Risks:** Competition from entities like Starlink may pressure ASTS's market share and profitability in the future, especially when SpaceX is expected to IPO (eventually). Remember that ASTS has 5 satellites and is working on \~19 more.

**Offhand Comments:** The market's reaction underscores the ""adoption trade"", kind of like how all the weed stocks moved with each other.

**Ticker:** [**PLTR (Palantir Technologies)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Nothing significant today, but we saw a huge spike up to $117.75 yesterday, likely from comments made during the Paris AI summit. Currently short.

**Technicals:** Interested in $115 level as an add, on the short side. Watching $120 as the level to cover on.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** PLTR has made the mother of all moves recently, gaining 50% in the past 2 weeks. Most of that was from earnings,

**Risks:** For a trade, I'm capping my risk at $120- everyone and their mother knows that PLTR is overvalued and run on hype at this point, and a move up to $100 from earnings might be tolerable but adding an extra 15% on top of that is irrational (in my opinion). Obviously there's significant retail interest in this stock, so will have to be agile and cognizant of what they're thinking as stock moves around.

News: [Us Initial Jobless Claims Pick Up But Stay Relatively Low](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-06/us-initial-jobless-claims-pick-up-but-stay-relatively-low)

**Ticker:** [**F (Ford Motor Company)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=F&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Ford Motor Company reports .39 vs .34 expected, revenue of $48.2 vs 43.6B expected. Announces that profit could fall by $2B or more due to tariffs and lower EV demand.

**Technicals:** Pretty much broke the $10 level it's been trading around since August, watching to see if it'll sell off more by the open. Highly/infinitely liquid.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The entire automotive industry is challenged by tariffs. F guided lower for 2025.

**Risks:** Obviously these are one of the bigger movers from Mexico tariffs (most cars are assembled in Mexico then shipped to the US).

**Related Tickers:** GM, TSLA, STLA.

**Offhand Comments:** Ford's outlook reflects the broader industry's apprehension about geopolitical factors affecting operations and profitability. Interesting to see how other car companies react to earnings as well.

**Ticker:** [**ARM (Arm Holdings)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ARM&p=d)

**Catalyst:** ARM reported EPS of $0.39 vs. $0.34 expected. Revenue of $983 million vs. $959M expected. Buoyed by Deepseek ban news, most likely as well.

**Technicals:** Was down roughly 8% after earnings, but seems to be somewhat recovering after Deepseek news.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Semiconductor sector is experiencing heightened demand, especially after PLTR's comments that the AI train will never stop. We're seeing growth in data center applications, the main driver of semis purchases.

**Risks:** Despite strong performance, Arm's lowered full-year revenue forecast has led to a 6% drop in its shares.

**Related Tickers:** NVDA, AMD, INTC.

**Ticker:** [**RBLX (Roblox Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RBLX&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Roblox Corporation reported earnings with an EPS of -$0.33 vs. -$0.46 expected. Revenue of $988.2M vs. $967.2M expected.

**Technicals:** $50 is the clear level here, note that earnings were released premarket rather than aftermarket yesterday. Seems to be a massive overreaction selloff (but has recovered somewhat).

**Risks:** IIRC Roblox isn't profitable yet- they're focusing on growth/revenue over profits, but most of their costs are outside their control (platform fees like the Apple store, developers, infrastructure for trust/safety for minors).

**Related Tickers:** EA, TTWO.

**Ticker:** [**NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** DeepSeek, a Chinese AI start-up, has temporarily suspended its API service top-ups due to server resource constraints. Additionally, U.S. lawmakers plan to introduce a bill to ban DeepSeek's chatbot application from government-owned devices over data security concerns.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The AI industry is under increased scrutiny regarding data security and geopolitical tensions but that's grown more laissez-faire under Trump. DeepSeek's service suspension and potential U.S. government ban helps American chip makers and NVDA especially, due to their continued dominance.

**Risks:** Deepseek getting banned will likely lead to greater reliance on American AI chatbots, spurring growth in American semis manufacturers.

**Related Tickers:** AMD, INTC, QCOM.

**Offhand Comments:** (I am currently long).

**Ticker:** [**SWKS (Skyworks Solutions)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SWKS&p=d)

**Catalyst:** EPS of $1.60 vs. $1.57 expected. Revenue of $1.07B vs 1.07B expected. Reports $2B stock buyback plan.

**Technicals:** Watching the $60 level, we've had a brutal fall from $90->$60. If we get closer I'm interested in some small bounce depending on volume/size of the move.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** SWKS supplies some of the chips for Apple's iPhone, and their iPhone sales haven't done too well recently- thus this has a knock-on effect by affecting SWKS's sales.

**Risks:** SWKS projected a revenue decline for the mobile segment and issued a lower profit forecast. They stated they anticipated a ""mid-to-high teens decline in mobile.""

**Offhand Comments: A lot of the firms that manufacture parts for the iPhone are linked in performance, especially if the iPhone is the main source of their sales- would be interesting to formulate some trading ideas from that.**

2025-02-05 18:54:07,NVIDIA,NVDA,Thinking about NVDA beyond 2025 Hyperscaler CapEx Growth,"With 3/4 hyperscalers reporting earnings already, the reaction to Nvidia has been positive, but stock still trades less than before DeepSeek. I believe the sentiment is that while 2025 will be great, Nvidia is nearing the ""end of great times"" and moving to a ""just good times"".

**Here's my take at a breakdown. I am not an expert, but have read a lot of positive and negative takes, I'm starting this thread to start a discussion not to pump the stock. Please don't comment ""Nvidia diamond hands durr"".** I didn't use AI to write this sadly.

I can't link out to some of the resources, but tried to describe them for easy search and find.

**TLDR:** Meeting 2025 revenue projections isn't at excessive risk based on CapEx raises so far. It's likely that production capacity may really be the limiting reagent for 2025 revenues not demand. Market is forward looking and there is uncertainity on 2026+ revenues (DeepSeek is one of them) - markets don't like that. However, uncertainity is an opportunity if Nvidia can deliver again - remember stocks climb a wall of worry.

**Disclosure:** Own a lot of NVDA. But have covered calls on them, so not a blindfold risktaker.

**Personal take:** NVDA is attractive at these levels, but I'd be cautious holding my entire position after the summer 2025 earnings calls from the hyperscalers, because if there's any indication there is a 2026 CapEx slowdown, stock could fall a lot. I can't predict the future, so diversification is important even if you like the stock.

However, continued chip innovation that maintains a competitive advantage that leads to higher end customer ROIs compared to other chip alternatives would help. Also, release of one tangible AI product would change the sentiment and game here (e.g. Robotaxis, enterprise solutions used common place for F500 companies, etc). Many are already underway - my company is releasing Gemini for all employees - this goes beyond software engineers. I think diversification across the industry (AVGO, TSM, power producers) could be valuable as time progresses as the AI use case boom happens.

\-----------------------------------------

**(1) Meeting 2025 Revenue projections isn't at excessive risk based on CapEx raises so far**

Based on [stockanalysis](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/nvda/forecast/) consensus 2024 to 2025 revenue growth is estimated to be 52%.

1. MSFT: 55.7B in 2024 to 80B in 2025
2. Google: 52.5B in 2024 to 75B in 2025
3. Meta: 39B in 2024 to 60B - 60B in 2025

Based on the numbers written above, the anticipated growth from hyperscaler capex spend is 46% (if we assume concentration of NVDA chip spend as percent of capex steady). Hyperscalers are estimated to be about 50% of Nvidia revenue. To reach the 52% target that means from the remainder of the revenue book, Nvidia needs 58% spend increase.

This doesn't seem unreasonable. **Potential** investments through StarGate (Oracle), OpenAI's increasingly independent spending funded by Softbank, and sovereign AI investments are a tailwind to that figure. However, sustained export controls (e.g. Biden's global export framework) and increased crackdowns are headwinds.

**(2) It's likely that production capacity may really be the limiting reagent for 2025 revenues not demand**

Based on multiple [sources](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidias-blackwell-gpus-are-sold-out-for-the-next-12-months-chipmaker-to-gain-market-share-in-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com), seems like Blackweel is sold out for the next 12 months anyways. So 2025 revenues may be a matter of strong production. Moreover, from the commentary that google had on their earnings call - seems like cloud growth is supply constrained by infrastructure rather than demand constrained. I believe for 2025 at least customers will buy as many NVIDIA chips as they can and its production that determines valuation.

Since the market is forward looking, 2025 revenue misses won't be as crucial as addressing the question of when is the demand going to slow down and the AI semiconductor sales from NVDA slowdown?

**(3) Market is forward looking and there is uncertainity on 2026+ revenues (DeepSeek is one of them)..markets don't like that**

No matter how you slice it, DeepSeek has provided true software driven advances that more efficiently use Nvidia GPUs and non-NVDA GPUs on the training and particularly inference level. You can look at the cost per inference token for DeepSeek vs. OpenAI. It has raised questions on the sustainability on needing cutting edge chips at high margins in the long run. Risks below.

* **Do closed loop models even have a moat over open source?**: Can closed-loop/proprietary LLMs develop models that demand a strong ROI justifying investment in more chips to **train** better models that **end users are willing to pay for**? Currently Sam Altman & Dario (Antropic) think compute is the way to go. However, at some point they could discover more compute for training =/= better or more efficient models.
* **Training:** Efficiencies in hardware utilization may reduce Nvidia's moat in interconnectivity and lead to better training advances, which could reduce margins if other chips are ""somewhat as good"" eventually given demand equalizes to supply. See point # 1 in this excellent recap here  (available by searching DeepSeek and the ramification on the AI industry: winners and losers? by Rihard Jarc)
* **More use cases in a post training world could mean more inference on custom chips & competitor products:** It is widely believed that Nvidia is more of an undisputed leader in training performance vs. inference. If open source models become good enough and training investments do not result in monetizable ROI, Nvidia's margins likely fall as custom chips and other semiconductor players provide good solutions. [Jevon's Paradox (more use cases and usage)](https://www.npr.org/sections/planet-money/2025/02/04/g-s1-46018/ai-deepseek-economics-jevons-paradox) is very likely here, but volume would have to increase signficantly to offset margin decreases - a risk that the market doesn't like.
* **CUDA alternatives leads to market share loses?:** CUDA is widely known to be the best option ""coding"" platform to get GPUs to do what you want right now. [However, there are other applications coming out that allow fungible usage of other chips. ](https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/17/nvidia_cuda_moat/#:~:text=If%20you're%20doing%20low,AMD%20hardware%20%E2%80%93%20and%20vice%20versa)This reduces the need to use Nvidia chips and pay such high margins. There's drawbacks to not using CUDA that I'll highlight in section 4.

Sidenote - there is an honest and excellent podcast on DeepSeek implications to Nvidia from Bankless w/ Jeffrey Emmanuel (whose blogpost got a lot of investors interested in DeepSeek impact over 2 weekends ago). Please listen.

**(4) However, uncertainity is an opportunity if Nvidia can deliver again - remember stocks climb a wall of worry.**

* **Early innings of the AI story:** Models are going to get more complex not stagnate. This requires more training compute as we try to reach AGI level models. On the inference front, as more use cases explode, there will be more general chip demand. We haven't even seen full released use cases in robotics, autonomous transit, healthcare AI, etc.
* **CUDA is the lowest latency** and provides best performance as of now. There might be a technical limit to how well alternatives perform.
* **Cost of being last** in AI is too great for hyperscalers
* **Continued innovation leadership:** Nvidia has expedited it's semiconductor cycle from 2 years to 1 year. Rubin (next gen AI chips) are already being worked on. Semiconductors are known to be cylical, but this may dull any trough cycle.
* **Increased soverign AI investments** (StarGate, Middle east, etc.)
* **Ridiculous cash flow with minimal R&D** as % of revenue means that Nvidia can invest in strategic ventures, emerging tech, and adjacent spaces to diversify revenue streams. Not sure this is proven out in the financials yet, but could in the future.
* **Hopefully - reduced interest rates boosts stock valuations**.

I've included a screenshot of interviews by Rihard Jarc with a former AMD employee on CUDA and training needs going forward after DeepSeek.",62,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iihlgz/thinking_about_nvda_beyond_2025_hyperscaler_capex/

News: [Trump Tariffs Push Us Manufacturers To Rush To Beat Mexico Canada Fees](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-05/trump-tariffs-push-us-manufacturers-to-rush-to-beat-mexico-canada-fees)

**Ticker:** [**AMD (Advanced Micro Devices)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMD&p=d)

**Catalyst:** AMD reported EPS of $0.29 vs. $0.41 expected. Revenue of $7.66 billion vs. $7.5 billion expected. Ultimately said that data center segment revw will be down in Q1, but had clear positive outlook in 2025 and expected double digit revenue growth. This was what caused the stock to fall despite the initial spike.

**Technicals:** Watching $100 level, but doesn't seem to be an irrational move in my opinion. Note that we've moved from $150 to $107 in the past 3 months.

**Risks:** The vast majority of NVDA/AMD/every semiconductor's business's money comes from selling to businesses- individual consumers are a tiny slice of the pie despite gaming/client businesses growing, so I don't really pay attention to them (one exception is NVDA'S 50 series GPUs selling out within 5 minutes) . We also have threats from NVDA dominance, possible regulations from the US, etc, (Disclaimer: I generally don't invest in AMD)

**Related Tickers:** NVDA, INTC, QCOM

**Offhand Comments:** Overall doesn't seem to have affected NVDA or other semis much because what they cited was weakness that was exclusive to them and not the broader semis market.

**Ticker:** [**GOOG (Alphabet Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GOOG&p=d)

**Catalyst:** GOOG/GOOGL reported fourth-quarter 2024 earnings with an EPS of $2.12 vs. $2.12 expected. Revenue of $96.5 billion vs. $96.67 billion expected. Cited FAR more spending in CapEx and a miss in cloud revenue (which signals that other competitors have taken their market share)

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Market had a pretty negative reaction to the news that they'd be investing far more in capex and missed on cloud revenue (was roughly $9B vs $12B expected).

**Risks:** Elevated capital spending may pressure Alphabet's margins if the capex spending doesn't result in increased revenue, especially amidst increasing competition in the AI and cloud markets. I don't really see the China investigation to affect their stock price much, Google Search and Youtube are blocked in China and I doubt that China is going to let Waymo operate in their cities rather than creating their own solution.

**Catalyst:** The U.S. Postal Service has suspended accepting parcels from China and Hong Kong following new tariffs imposed by Trump, affecting logistics companies like UPS and FedEx.

**Technicals:** I'm mainly interested in PDD because they own Temu, which focuses on shipping small/low-cost goods to the US and using the loophole for very low shipping costs.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The recent suspension by USPS may lead to increased demand for private carriers like UPS and FedEx to handle parcels from China. There are a number of Chinese companies that focus on shipping low cost goods (like PDD).

**Risks:** Heightened tariffs and trade barriers could disrupt supply chains, increase costs, and lead to potential overreliance on private carriers, which may face capacity constraints and regulatory scrutiny.

**Technicals:** Watching $60 level, no bias.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Despite Uber's strong quarterly performance, they cited a potential $1 billion impact from a strong U.S. dollar on future bookings which results in worse earnings overseas.

**Risks:** Outside of self-driving cars (Uber partnered with Waymo to operate in Austin), currency fluctuations and international markets affect companies you wouldn't normally expect. This may move in future from tariff news.

**Catalyst:** Trump announced that the United States plans to take over the Gaza Strip, relocate its residents to neighboring countries, and redevelop the area.

**Technicals:** USO didn't move much on this piece of news, but if Trump actually makes this a policy then we might see a LOT more volatility in the future depending on how serious we get and if we get involved again.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The oil sector is sensitive to geopolitical developments in the Middle East, a region critical to global oil supply. Initial market reactions to Trump's Gaza proposal didn't impact oil prices. Not really a catalyst TODAY but worth thinking about in the future.

**Risks:** Potential escalation of regional tensions could disrupt oil production or transportation, leading to supply constraints and increased volatility in oil prices.

**Ticker:** [**PLTR (Palantir Technologies Inc)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Reported earnings of $0.14 vs. $0.11 expected. Revenue of $828 million vs. $777 million expected. Management highlighted the power of AI and their sizable contracts, citing the nature of the AI war being winner-take-all.

**Technicals:** PLTR absolutely exploded and hit $102 premarket, currently watching $100 level to see if we continue the move. Other than that unlikely to be trading this unless we have massive volume come in.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The PLTR ER highlighted the growing demand for AI-driven solutions across government/commercial sectors. Company emphasized securing substantial contracts in the competitive AI landscape, important because they are more closely aligned with the current government.

**Risks:** Obviously being more closely tied to the government means that it has more leeway to be more monopolistic/aggresive in their actions, Alex Karp and Peter Thiel are closely aligned with current government leaders.

**Ticker:** [**NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Chinese AI company DeepSeek is reportedly preparing to switch to domestic GPUs to circumvent NVDA chip restrictions. DeepSeek has bypassed NVDA CUDA for certain operations, utilizing the PTX (Parallel Thread Execution) language instead. Additionally, on February 2nd, DeepSeek, in collaboration with SiliconFlow and Huawei Cloud, launched DeepSeek-R1/V3 inference services on Huawei's Ascend AI chips. Huawei is also promoting its new Ascend AI processors to Chinese groups considering ""inference"" as an option.

**Technicals:** After the insane move we've seen from $150 to $118, I actually don't consider this to be earth shattering news- China has always been trying to develop their own semis and not using NVDA for training is what they were ""supposed"" to be doing due to the trade restrictions. I'm still long but selling calls against my position, recovery might be slow for NVDA. It's interesting that they are attempting to bypass CUDA, which is essentially the ""standard"" for ML/AI training nowadays on NVDA chips and developing their own.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** DeepSeek's move to adopt domestic GPUs and bypass CUDA indicates they're aiming for technological self-reliance amidst U.S. export restrictions, rather than trying to adopt more NVDA chips (which presumably isn't a viable long term strategy).

**Risks:** Nvidia faces potential revenue loss if Chinese companies increasingly adopt domestic GPUs and alternative programming frameworks. The effectiveness of U.S. export controls may be undermined as Chinese firms develop workarounds.

In response, China announced retaliatory tariffs effective February 10, including a 15% tariff on U.S. coal and liquefied natural gas, and a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery, and large-engine vehicles.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The imposition of these tariffs marks a significant escalation in U.S.-China trade tension and more volatility to come through Trump tweets- we might see a trade war again (sigh) like we did in 2019. Not 100% sure if agricultural machinery will affect stocks like DE but will look into it.

**Related Tickers:** JD, BIDU, TCEHY, PDD

**Offhand Comments:** There are going to be retaliation investigations against companies operating in America, INTC and GOOG have recently been announced as under investigation by China.

**Technicals:** Watching $5 level, no bias. I'm not 100% sure if there's an actual ""acquisition"" share price for GoTo but will keep eyes peeled for that acquisition premium.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The potential merger represents a significant consolidation in SEA's ride-hailing and food delivery sectors. Mergers typically streamline operations and reduce competition, leading to improved profitability for the combined entity.

**Risks:** The proposed merger may face regulatory hurdles, including antitrust concerns, which could delay or derail the deal. Standard M&A obstacles.

2025-02-01 09:33:36,NVIDIA,NVDA,Do you think it's time to sell NVDA?,"The introduction of Deepseek probably doesn't warrant the sharp stock decline value of NVDA, that is understandable. But so is their stock value rise for the past 2 years. To put it in other words, yes the decline was a result of a hype, but so was the rise. Something that didn't make much sense got replaced by another thing that doesn't make much sense. At the end of the day, Nvidia is a great company that sells the best computer chips and GPU's, but that's all there is to it. I just don't see how they can rise again for the foreseeable future. They've hit a peak point in my opinion. And while Deepseek's introduction shouldn't have been the reason for their stock decline vlue, it was just a trigger for something that was in my opinion inevitable. 

I was pressured by family members into buying NVDA, and now the total loss is about 13.5% of its original price. I feel like I should just close the position as I just don't see how it can rise again for me to recoup the losses, but I also don't want to do something based on feelings. I hope someone in this subreddit can help. I try to do some due diligence and understand metrics, but I'm no expert and I'm finding it difficult to put the time into learning these things with my very demanding fulltime job, which is why I usually stick with  low risky ETF's, except for Nvidia which I was kinda pressured into buying, and I was worried that it might become even more profitable and then hearing ""I told you so!"".",0,66,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1if2ukg/do_you_think_its_time_to_sell_nvda/
2025-01-31 16:46:00,NVIDIA,NVDA,"AAPL - 26,527.62% return over 25 years","Today to the day is the anniversary of twenty five years of my first purchase of AAPL shares.  I bought 1200 dollars worth.

In early 2000, I had just graduated college.  I had a few thousand given to me as an inheritance that was being managed by a broker.

 I asked the broker about purchasing some Apple shares, and he was unimpressed, and unmoved. I was annoyed at him. Apple was the one I had the strongest impulse to purchase.

 Why apple? I had gone from being skeptical of Apple. My  college was very heavily Mac, but I had PCs.  I was unimpressed at the OS, but I was struck by people’s reactions to Jobs.  He was enthusiastic, and I liked the cut of the jib who liked the cut of his jib. I was drawn to the elitism of the people to the brand, and felt it could bounce back. This was even before iPods, mind you, before OS X.  

These were the days of the dotcom boom. This broker was taking like 500 bucks for every trade. This felt unfair, in light of the great digital democratization that was in progress, I wanted the power.  And E*trade was relatively new and it seemed legit.  I hadn’t done anything like this before, I was just a kid, really, but I decided to just go for it. 

I sold most of the shares I inherited, and threw 1200 bucks into Apple.  `(also a few other, less impressive stocks)' I did marvelously the first few months as the market soared, as did most people. 

And…. it  came tumbling down in April 2000.  Disillusioned, I decided not to try to reposition my shares, and I just let things ride for a few months.  When I rebalanced by portfolio, I kept my apple shares, which had split, despite the pull-back.

Every year, I would consider would I buy more apple now?  And it didn't occurr me to sell. Apple often seemed almost comically undervalued, and I held on or increased my investment in it.

Every time apple goes up 1 point, I get more than my initial investment back. Why? Splits.

•	2-for-1 split in 2000  
•	2-for-1 split in 2005  
•	7-for-1 split in 2014  
•	4-for-1 split in 2020

Nowadays cost basis: .88 cents.     As of today that investment has grown 26,527.62%. I added more and more apple across the years, and had some other lucky calls (my second largest holding is NVDA) but no move matches that whimsical lucky move of 25 years ago today.

The security that owning these securities has offered me is significant.  It has let me have a job that isn’t that well-payed and support my family with emergencies being take of by extra funds. We own a lot of apple products, because with the dividends, it sort of just pays for them.

I do think it’s good to give early adults access to a few thousand dollars to play the market and plan to do that with my own children.  Although I didn’t sell my shares, what I did do is convert a bunch of them to a donor advised fund (avoiding taxes, whee), and I give to charity from that for annual giving, and that feels like a win win win proposition.  

I do feel overexposed in AAPL and NVDA, but due to still hopefully having another at least 25 years to go in my life is that pullbacks eventually come back up. The biggest principle that has guided my investing is “Don’t buy crap if you can help it”, and that's my advice to new investors.",988,139,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iej3mb/aapl_2652762_return_over_25_years/

The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

Catalyst I'm looking out for today- NVDA CEO to meet with White House officials, and server capex cost for DeepSeek estimated to be almost $1.3B. Deepseek capabilities are expected to be copied by US firms.

News: [Fed's Favored Inflation Gauge Posted Muted Advance In December](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-31/fed-s-favored-inflation-gauge-posted-muted-advance-in-december)

Ticker: [AAPL (Apple Inc.)](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)

Catalyst: Apple reported EPS of $2.40 vs. $2.35, and revenue of $124.3B vs 124B.

Despite these positive results, the company provided cautious guidance for the upcoming quarter, citing uncertainties related to the impact of new AI features on sales. Tim Cook mentioned that Apple Intelligence DID lead to stronger sales/growth in areas where it was rolled out (it has limited rollout right now).

Volume/Market Cap/Technicals: Watching $250 level, no strong bias. We've seen AAPL swing close to 20% this month, (on report of sales weakness in China) but doubt this will continue.

Context: Most immediate news that comes to mind was the weakness of sales in China for the iPhone, causing the move this month.

Risks: Don't really see immediate risks beyond the trade war, in 2019/2020 this resulted in AAPL moving manufacturing/production to other countries in South East Asia- slowing growth in China has been pretty consistent, however.

Related Tickers: rest of FAANG, Samsung if you can trade overseas stocks, the various phone component manufacturers that trade with AAPL

Offhand: Apple is investing in its own high-speed network infrastructure to enhance content delivery, (just like META's undersea pipeline)

Ticker: [ACMR (ACM Research, Inc.)](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ACMR&p=d)

Catalyst: Kerrisdale Capital released a bullish report on ACM Research (ACMR), a semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment (WFE) company positioned in China but headquartered in America.

It leads China as a leading supplier of wafer cleaning tools and beneficiary of China's push toward semiconductor self-sufficiency.

Kerrisdale predicts the company to eventually compete globally and cites it as a potential 10x return. Trades at 1x 2025E revenue (likely due to China fears).

Volume/Market Cap/Technicals: This is the interesting part- ACMR holds a $1.2B mkt cap but trades at a massive discount compared to its Chinese subsidiary (ACMS), which has a $5.9 billion market cap and trades at 6x 2025E revenue.

The report suggests that ACMR’s NASDAQ valuation is severely mispriced and could re-rate significantly as investors recognize the valuation gap.

Context: China/US chip war, you guys know what this is.

Sector Context: The global semiconductor industry is shifting, with China attempting to localize chip production.

Kerrisdale argues that restrictions on U.S. and Japanese WFE exports to China will only fuel ACMR’s growth as Chinese fabs increasingly turn to domestic suppliers.

China's WFE self-sufficiency has grown from 4% in 2019 to 17% in 2024 and is expected to reach 36% by 2026.

Risks: Geopolitical factors, including further U.S. export restrictions, could impact ACMR’s operations. Similar to how we have the NVDA trade restriction going on right now. However, Kerrisdale sees these restrictions as a net positive due to ACMR having less competition in China as a result. There are other players in the WFE space in China, but ACMR has a technological moat.

Ticker: [INTC](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=INTC&p=d)

Catalyst: Intel reported revenue of $14.26B vs exp of $13.81B. Most important, the company anticipated breakeven EPS next quarter.

Volume/Market Cap/Technicals: Somewhat rangebound for the past 3 months. Watching $20 but nothing interesting I'm watching beyond that.

Context: This earnings report is Intel's first since the departure of CEO Pat Gelsinger. Right now INTC is being led by two interim co-CEOs, and another price catalyst that could potentially happen is someone competent being picked lol. Also worth thinking of the NVDA/Deepseek/semiconductor news when reading through these catalysts.

Intel has also announced a delay in its Falcon Shores GPU and only using it internally within the company.

Risks: Intel faces significant competition from companies such as NVIDIA and AMD, the delay of their chip is pretty bad news.

Related Tickers: AMD/NVDA/TSM

Ticker: [ASTS](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASTS&p=d)

Catalyst: ASTS has received special temporary authority from the FCC to test its space-based cellular broadband network in the United States. Allows for collaboration efforts with VZ/T.

Volume/Market Cap/Technicals: Slight rise, but will watch this at open to see if volume comes in.

Context: The FCC's authorization allows ASTS to provide cell/satellite comms, allowing for greater coverage and signals that more use of ASTS satellites. I remember that the company was essentially valued based on each satellite they launched successfully in 2024, whether that hype returns remains to be seen but overall not interested in trading this unless we have retail interest again.

Sector Context: SpaceX's Starlink is also entering the direct-to-cell market, as I noted a few days ago- most of the investment that can be done in these type of cell/sat comms in public markets can really only be done in ASTS.

Risks: If SpaceX IPOs we might see a selloff in this stock simply because SpaceX is far larger/established and Elon Musk has closer ties to the government.

The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

**Today OpenAI may make history. Trying out longer form, more detailed catalyst examinations over the short-form with more tickers.**

**Ticker:** [**META (Meta Inc)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=META&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Reported earnings of $8.02 vs $6.68 expected. Revenue of $48.4B vs $47B,but guided revenue short of consensus and didn't provide FY25 revenue outlook (which triggered the reason for the selloff post-earnings after the close).

Their CAPEX announcement was $60-65B vs $52.4B expected, and stated they expected the single largest driver of expesive growth in 2025 as infrastructure costs due to higher OpEX and depreciation.

Also announced plans to grow META's AI team significantly.

**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** Earnings move the stock on far less volume but the initial selloff after announcement was worth trading- interested in the $700 level today but not much beyond that.

**Context:** Decent earnings but signals that there is more spending on the horizon- likely that the initial brutal selloff to $606 was from algos just reading the initial eye-popping CAPEX number and selling the company.

**Sector Context:**There is a major next-level breakthrough that OpenAI is expected to release today that has agents performing on the same level as PHDs, Altman is meeting today with US government officials. META is the creator of Llama, which is another open source model compared to OpenAI's closed models.

**Risks:** Deepseek has been the main threat involved, with competitors from China using distillation and other AI techniques to be able to train a far cheaper model that brings up the question of why our large tech firms are spending so much on GPUs. (I'm sure this is news to you /s)

**Related Tickers:** FAANG stocks, SNAP, PINS, etc.

Offhand:  Something worth remembering is that there is a $10B undersea cable that spans over 40K km that they plan to build (unknown what the cable is for), more details coming in 2025. Likely some kind of fiber optic cable.

**Ticker:** [**TSLA (Tesla Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Reported earnings of $0.73 vs $0.76 expected. Revenue of $25.71B vs $27.23B expected. Most of this revenue miss came from miss in sale of EVs. 

TSLA announced interesting plans to lower the price of EVs in 2025 but also didn't give specific details regarding the production volume targets (as they have in the past), and also announced that there would be a paid robotaxi service in Austin in June. This puts them in competition with Waymo/UBER. Personally I think the vision-only approach is not viable in the long-run but hey, I'm no self-driving PHD. 

CAPEX was ALSO higher as with META due to spending increases from AI training infra costs and battery production capacity.

**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** I'm mainly interested in the $375/$400 level, not too interested in going long despite the multi-day slide in price.

**Context:** Main reason for TSLA's selloff was the lack of full-year guidance (it gives the subtext that it's too bad to release publically or it's up in the air). Political statements made by Musk may contribute to future issues for TSLA.

**Sector Context:** Revenue shortfall was caused due to lower-than-expected vehicle deliveries/ increased sale incentives, 496K cars vs 507K exp. China's BYD is rapidly catching up, and the (possible) removal of the US EV tax credit may make EV's more expensive

**Risks:** Mainly geopolitical- if the tariffs on EV vehicles imported to the US gets removed, TSLA will face fiercer competition from BYD. Also Elon Musk.

**Related Tickers:** BYD (but mainly trades in China, TSLA isn't as impacted by AI news.)



[**NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation) (in addition to ARM/AMD/SMH/SOXL/semiconductor stocks)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** The reveal of Deepseek has introduced an AI model that rivals existing solutions but was developed at around $6M. However there's a rumor that Deepseek is actually trained on 50K H100 NVDA gpus.

**Yesterday after the close, there was an announcement Trump officials discussing tightening curbs on Nvidia's China sales.**

**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** Overall, there's been a massive selloff since NVDA was $150 at the end of last week. Overall interested again if we hit $116, but low confidence we'll sell off again. 

Currently long.

**Sector Context:** Not much to really say about this beyond NVDA having the most advanced chips that are widespread for training because of the CUDA architecture- most people are doubtful that the TOTAL cost was $6M

US Officials are examining export restrictions but China will likely find a way to bypass them as they have previously.

**Risks:** Mainly geopolitical, again. Obviously it's very difficult to restrict trade to a country that we have no military presence in or surround, and China is economically far more powerful than those we have attempted trade restrictions on in the past.

2025-01-30 09:25:12,NVIDIA,NVDA,Did You Buy Any Stocks On Monday?,"This post is kinda late but was just thinking, market was down on Monday. NVDA went down 17% and SPY was down like 2%.

Did you get into any shopping of stocks or etfs on the past Monday, 27 Jan? Or were you holding your cash as there's FOMC and JPow yesterday?

My case was, I nearly did wanna DCA more into NVDA at $118 but was also quite unsure if it would go down further due to Deepsake plus FOMC.

Of course PLTR was also in my list and it was a good price but NVDA was hard to miss on Monday.

In the end, I actually went with SCHG instead as I'm trying to increase my ETF portfolio even though I'm still a stock picker.

# [Stock futures are little changed as investors await Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/28/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures were near the flatline on Wednesday as investors turned toward the first Federal Reserve interest rate decision of 2025.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched down 13 points. Nasdaq 100 futures were 0.3% higher, while S&P 500 futures was trading around the flatline.
*****
> Tech stocks on Tuesday led the S&P 500 higher and brought the Nasdaq Composite to a 2% gain. The two indexes made a comeback after incurring sharp losses on Monday in a sell-off spurred by the emergence of China’s DeepSeek and the threat it poses to the artificial intelligence trade. Nvidia, which suffered a roughly 17% decline Monday, jumped nearly 9% on Tuesday.
*****
> “As far as the DeepSeek news over the weekend, at the end of the day today, there really hasn’t been that much of an impact on a market-wide basis,” Bespoke Investment Group co-founder Paul Hickey said Tuesday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.”
*****
> The Fed’s interest rate decision on Wednesday is now a focal point for investors, as well as Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference. Fed funds futures data reflect a nearly 100% certainty that the central bank will keep rates steady at a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, according to CME Group data.
*****
> “When it comes to the Fed, they’re widely not expected to do anything tomorrow and that’s a good thing. The less the Fed has to do, the better it is for the market, in our view,” Hickey added.
*****
> Investors will be paying especially close attention to Powell’s comments — his first press conference in President Donald Trump’s second term. The two have had a contentious relationship dating back to Trump’s first term. The president has already said he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”
*****
> A volley of Big Tech earnings are due Wednesday afternoon, with Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Tesla issuing their quarterly reports.

2025-01-28 20:49:53,NVIDIA,NVDA,Bridgewater sees short-term correction for tech stocks but bullish on DeepSeek impact By Reuters,"""Bridgewater sees short-term correction for tech stocks but bullish on DeepSeek impact""

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/bridgewater-sees-shortterm-correction-for-tech-stocks-but-bullish-on-deepseek-impact-3834767



  Hedge fund manager Bridgewater Associates said Chinese startup DeepSeek's launch of its latest artificial intelligence (AI) models could lead to a short-term correction in many tech companies' share prices but is positive for the industry.

The comments come amid a tech stocks sell-off prompted by the release of a free AI assistant launched by DeepSeek last week that the startup said uses less data at a fraction of the cost of services currently available.

DeepSeek's AI Assistant has overtaken rival ChatGPT to become the top-rated free application available on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s App Store in the United States, raising doubts about the reasoning behind some U.S. tech companies' decision to pledge billions of dollars in AI investment.

""DeepSeek’s progress is big news, but not bad news for most of the AI ecosystem,"" Bridgewater said in a note on Monday authored by Co-Chief Investment Officer Greg Jensen and Jas Sekhon, chief scientist of AIA Labs, a division within the hedge fund focused on developing and utilizing AI and machine learning technologies to generate investment strategies and insights.

DeepSeek threatens share prices for many tech stocks in the short term, Bridgewater said.

""This may be especially true for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), because DeepSeek’s success may encourage companies to invest more in achieving efficiency gains by optimizing how AI software interacts with the hardware,"" said the note.

Shares in Nvidia, a leader in the AI chip market, fell 17% on Monday, wiping $593 billion from its market value - a record one-day loss for any company - and dragged U.S. stocks lower. That drop was partly corrected on Tuesday, with Nvidia shares up around 5% in premarket trading.

2025-01-28 13:30:21,NVIDIA,NVDA,(1/28) - Tuesday's Pre-Market News & Stock Movers,"#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the new trading day and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Tuesday, January the 28th, 2025-

# [S&P 500 futures are flat as Nvidia attempts to rebound from AI stock rout: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/27/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> S&P 500 futures were relatively unchanged early Tuesday, following a sell-off fueled by worries over the emergence of Chinese startup DeepSeek and its greater implications for the artificial intelligence trade.
*****
> Futures tied to the S&P 500, along with Nasdaq 100 futures, traded just above the flatline, rising 0.1%. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were also flat.
*****
> Futures were trading in step with Nvidia in the premarket, with both trading off their highs during the session. Nvidia added around 2% after suffering a nearly 17% decline on Monday, which resulted in a market cap loss of nearly $600 billion — the biggest one-day drop for a U.S. company in history. Broadcom and Oracle also traded higher by more than 2% and around 1%, respectively.
*****
> Concerns over DeepSeek came to a head on Monday, with the Nasdaq Composite losing more than 3%, while the S&P 500 slid about 1.5%. The Chinese startup last month unveiled a free open-source large language model that it says took less than $6 million to build. The development spurred worries around Big Tech’s investment into AI. DeepSeek surpassed rival OpenAI on Monday to become the most-downloaded free app in the U.S. on Apple’s App Store.
*****
> “Valuations remain extended, and while vulnerabilities were expected this year, developments like DeepSeek highlight the need for diversification beyond the Mag Seven,” said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. “The 2025 theme of US exceptionalism is now facing uncertainty, with ongoing concerns around tariffs and inflation adding to market challenges.”
*****
> Investors’ attention is turning toward corporate earnings due this week. Starbucks is due to report Tuesday after the bell. A slate of Magnificent Seven companies will report in the coming days, with Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Tesla and Apple due later this week.
*****
> The Federal Reserve will also kick off its two-day policy meeting on Tuesday. Fed funds futures are pricing in a more than 99% chance that interest rates will remain unchanged, according to CMEGroup’s FedWatch Tool. Inflation data out Friday will give investors further insight on the health of the U.S. economy.

I have a question regarding DCA or a **monthly investment plan of 100-200€.** I already have a portfolio of around **145 k** in only stocks. I'm not allowed (legally) to have any Indices or ETF's so I based all my stock picks off of the S&P500. I'm really happy with how the stocks have preformed but who isn't since 2024 was a great year in stocks. I'm still quite young and am planning to just hold the stocks till I retire or so **(35+ years)**. I'm also planning to keep investing in different stocks when I have the money to invest, but now I want to start start the habit of saving first.

I have 15 stocks: **Invested capital 115.000** (Jan & Feb 2024) and an internal rate of return of 26% (+28.000)

**USA 88%** and **Europe 12%**

**Tech 26%**

**Consumer Goods 25%**

**Berkshire B 14%**

**Healthcare 11%**

**Industry 9%**

**Alphabet 7%**

**Finance 7%**.

I just started studying and want to keep my portfolio growing so I want to **save/invest 100-200$** into one or two stocks a month, but dont know which ones. I have a few ideas (APPL, more microsoft, more Berkshire, more Amazon, Pepsi, more Alphabet, Johnson & Johnson, Unilever, NVDA, Netflix and more Visa) \*more means I already have those stocks.

2025-01-28 08:26:50,NVIDIA,NVDA,I dont understand the reasoning of Deepseek causing NVDA to drop so massively,"The very gist of Deepseek is that it was able to develop a new AI model at a very quick turn around time and at a very reduced price.

however, its still using NVDA chips. it doesnt hurt NVDA at all. they can literally restrict supply chain. or just only continue to produce expensive flagships.

if Deepseeks tech caused companys that are also developing AI, such as Google, Open AI, MSFT, etc, that can somewhat make sense.

but i dont understand the hit on the company's thats designing/making the chips.

  
at the end of the day, they are still going to, and have to , rely on NVDA and TSM.

  
so why does this have an impact on NVDA?",1,97,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ibx21s/i_dont_understand_the_reasoning_of_deepseek/
2025-01-27 19:16:17,NVIDIA,NVDA,70% of AI workloads will shift to real-time inference by 2030 (McKinsey) - What stocks benefit?,"This was published 3 days ago so not sure if it was coincidence or triggered by the Deepseek panic. But it's certainly timely:

>While training current advanced AI models requires immense computing resources, the shift towards real-time decision-making - known as inferencing - is poised to drive massive demand for additional computing power. According to McKinsey, 60-70% of AI workloads are expected to shift to real-time inference by 2030, creating an urgent need for low-latency connectivity, compute and security at the edge beyond current demand.

Note that this is a [Verizon press release](https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-unveils-ai-strategy-power-next-gen-ai-demands), so take it with a grain of salt. (I tried looking for the original McKinsey article but didn't find it).

Assuming this projection is true, what stocks will benefit? 

* Telecom? AT&T went up big today?
* Apple and other mobile related stocks?
* Edge computing and cybersecurity?

I asked Perplexity and this was the result:

* NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): NVIDIA is a leading player in edge computing and AI-optimized processors15. Its EGX Edge Computing Platform offers a comprehensive solution combining hardware and software for various edge computing applications1.

* Arista Networks (ANET): Arista has developed a growing business providing network equipment for small, on-site data centers and infrastructure software for managing local networks enabled by edge computing2.

* Nutanix (NTNX): Nutanix offers hardware for cloud and edge computing, with its hyper-converged technology ensuring high performance and agility for edge computing users2.

* Ambarella (AMBA): Ranked as a top edge AI stock for 2025, Ambarella focuses on developing specialized hardware for edge computing applications3.

* Cloudflare (NET): Strategically positioned at the intersection of AI, cybersecurity, and edge computing, Cloudflare is well-placed to benefit from these trends5.

* Accenture plc (ACN): Accenture's ""Accenture One Edge Platform"" provides a unified solution for managing Cloud-Edge-IoT computing, positioning it to benefit from the growing demand for edge computing services7.",134,50,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ibhe81/70_of_ai_workloads_will_shift_to_realtime/

If anything, US companies will double down on training a better model. A lot of smaller companies can now enter the market due to low cost / low barrier to entry. And how do you think those model will be trained?

They are all using Nvidia chipset. If you didn’t know, now you know!

Sell all you can, because people who know will buy low so they can sell even higher.

Update: Found this article that says total REAL cost to train DeepSeek was in the region of 500M when taking into account other costs. This is far higher than what they claimed (6M) but still lot cheapr than OpenAI's $7b budget.

I know Amazon reinvests earnings so this probably plays a part but how much?

Amazon also has highest revenue of any of its peers, and margins on e-commerce are skeletal and 60% of net income comes from AWS.

Is this high P/E a problem or not? I suspect given Amazon had $574 billion in revenue in 2023 there's only so many years the company can continue growing at 10% a year.

2025-01-24 16:45:43,NVIDIA,NVDA,"Single, retired mom buys PLTR puts","As the title says. I mean, why not? YoLo, right? But besides that, let me summarize my reasons of the purchase below, and you smart folks can comment/ critique me.

Fundamental reasons:

* End of wars: I know, this is as unconventional opinion as me buying PLTR puts. But the whole ideology of new guv is reciprocal _""scratch my back""_, as opposed to Biden's _""give us the oil or else..""_. I see tightening fiscal spending, DOGE which includes defense, to some extent.
* Valuations: this one is easy to see. Take PE, PS whatever metric. It's overvalued AF!! I doubt, if PLTR engineers are necessarily smarter than any Mag-7 tech guys. I'd bet the opposite rather. I've seen their products, trust me 😉, I know. The whole sales pitch is based on cronyism, arm-twisting, because those ""POCs"" (proof of concept testing of their software) is as corrupt as Pfizer's new drugs.

Technical/ options data facts:

* Ridiculous run up in price - it is THE BEST preforming stock of 2024, and after a tiny dip, has sprung back to life. To me, this is plain euphoria.
* Besides, it's a high beta stock. It's a good hedge against any softness in broad markets, which too are getting frothy. I see this PUT as a hedge against my tiny profits on index ETFs.
* Ridiculous premiums. Implied volatility at 70-80%. This means even for a good 5% move in stock price, OTM options would barely move 10%. This is great news for sellers, but also for buyers, because the premium value is farely stagnant and ""safe"". I know, it won't stay like this forever but then it's volatile *for a reason* (i.e. earnings). 
* Based on previous guidance, the '24 earnings are not going to be as stellar as people expect. On that note, even if the earnings are good, as happened often to NVDA, market isn't ever satisfied. NVDA crashed even after 100% revenue growth! Same could happen to this one too. Of course, this is pure speculation, but hey, did you read the title of this post? 😉",0,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1i8zs6d/single_retired_mom_buys_pltr_puts/
2025-01-24 04:10:35,NVIDIA,NVDA,Switched from Ameriprise managed account to Fidelity - Sell individual stocks?,"After a year of trying an Ameriprise managed account, I recently moved everything to Fidelity to start managing it myself. They underperformed the S&P500 (before their fee), and almost all positions are just S&P500 companies anyways, so I figured if I went 100% into an S&P index on my own I can't do worse.

I'm not sure how best to proceed with the current number of individual stocks. There are 64 positions total and it's unrealistic that I'll be able to keep track of the performance/trajectory of that many companies. Buffet's ""pick a few winners"" comes to mind. I've been assuming the best thing to do is to slowly liquidate the one's I don't have a specific interest in, and buy VOO/SPY in their place.

There are many companies that I like and would like to hold on to (AAPL, AMD, AMZN, BRKB, GOOGL, JNJ, KO, MSFT, NVDA, NFLX, PG). However, the majority are S&P 500 companies that I don't follow closely (ABT, ADBE, AMAT, AMGN, AMT, AVGO, AZN, BA, BMY, CAT, COP, CRM, CVX, ... to name a few). It's not that I don't know those companies, but it feels ignorant to hold onto them knowing that I won't have time to monitor their performance.

Is there a best way to go about liquidating those and moving into an S&P 500 index? Initial temptation is gambler's fallacy (sell the low performers first and keep the better ones a bit longer).",3,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1i8mzb1/switched_from_ameriprise_managed_account_to/

Anyone who was around at the time can testify that this really did represent consensus opinions in this sub at that time, which you can see in the comments of that post.  Note that the game store madness did not really begin until a couple weeks later, which is why it did not appear there.

I felt like it was going to play out poorly so I bookmarked it, and now have been doing yearly updates.  After all, for something like this, you really need to give it a multiple year timeline at least.

We are now on year 4, and to date I have sarcastically remarked about how the sharp, financial geniuses of the time performed against SPY and VTI.  This year I was rather surprised at the results.  All 2025 numbers use the prices right now.

*I used a $100,000 initial investment and just rounded all the prices to the dollar for visual simplicity (all entries use the real, full prices, I have just rounded them for this table).  This also backtracks prices from stock splits.*

Taiwan's Foxconn (2317.TW), opens new tab, the world's largest contract electronics maker, beat expectations to post its highest-ever revenue for the fourth quarter on continued strong demand for artificial intelligence (AI) servers.


Revenue for Apple's biggest iPhone assembler jumped 15.2% to T$2.13 trillion ($64.72 billion), Foxconn said in a statement on Sunday.


It was also ahead of a T$2.1 trillion LSEG SmartEstimate, which gives greater weight to forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurat

Robust AI server demand led to strong revenue growth for its cloud and networking products division, said Foxconn, whose customers include AI chip firm Nvidia.


For smart consumer electronics, which includes iPhones, there was ""roughly flattish"" year-on-year growth, it said.


Total revenue in December alone reached T$654.8 billion, up 42.3% year on year and the second-highest ever level for the month.

In the first quarter of 2025, overall operations have gradually entered the traditional off-season,"" Foxconn said of its outlook for the current quarter.

2025-01-04 08:04:26,NVIDIA,NVDA,Is it worth it to invest time into learning technical analysis? ,"For context, I've been buying stocks and options since I turned 18 around 3 months ago, so I don't have a lot of experience or knowledge in the first place. I've just been making moves based on my own research combined with other people's ideas. I was looking through a discord where people share their ideas as I wanted to expand my portfolio past being 65% NVDA and 35% random bullshit, and I often see these pictures of daily 5 minute candles with countless horizontal, diagonal, and curvy lines. The poster then mentions various names for some candlestick patterns and says something about how the stock closed above/under the EMA or some crap then proceeds to justify their following move, seeming to have full confidence because of this chart they drew.

So I thought, if I could go by the book and use rules and numbers to get a solid guess on which way the stock's gonna go, I'd be rich. But if it were that easy, everyone would be rich. And one look through this r/wallstreetbets makes it clear that there's not a lot of people who have achieved that status.

I'm posting to ask if learning about all this is worth it. I know that the market is unpredictable and there's no way looking at a bunch of lines will give me a positive winrate, but does it help? For example, could you have a better chance at guessing what's gonna happen in the next 30 minutes if you recognized the pattern that came before it? I know that I cannot expect the book to be right all the time, but would it at least give me a better shot at it?

I haven't tried this at all and so far I've been doing fine, though I know the stuff I've bought have been nice to me in the months I've held it and I can't expect the same in the future (I started with 7k, now at 9k, with 50% of gains unrealized from mostly NVDA and RKLB, 50% of gains realized from TSLA and NVDA calls bought post-election). I know reading these patterns won't help in the long run, as I'm holding shares and am not planning to sell in the foreseeable future, but I want to understand what these people are talking about when they do TAs and try it for myself to see if it actually helps or not. Maybe try buying 0dte for SPY and QQQ to harvest some loss porn for WSB.

2024-12-18 16:30:54,NVIDIA,NVDA,Why I'm bullish on AMD,"I don't think it makes sense for AMD to be down so much this year, even though the tech sector is doing well

I think AMD shares fell 5% last week despite being the leader in CPU (now that Intel is in trouble) and to a lesser extent GPU makers

I'm bullish on AMD for the following reasons

\-Replacement GPU are available on a budget when NVDA can't meet supply demand in the next few years

\-It's the best CPU for consumers and data centers, no doubt about it. and you need CPU to reason about AI models trained on GPU

\-The PC market will enter a 4-5 year upgrade period next year, especially with the end of Windows 10 support

\-AMD may release next-gen consoles for which it makes custom processors

Before anyone says NVDA is 1000x better than AMD ......

I agree that AMD is not dominant in CUDA and that they are years behind NVDA in this area and may not even be close to catching up

I don't think AMD is “dead” in the consumer GPU space

I agree that most developers consider NVDA when developing games, but it's definitely a cheaper alternative to NVDA, especially in less affluent countries

I have reservations about what I'm going to say next - I think AMD is going to overshadow what's left of NVDA

Given AMD recent acquisitions, I also expect AMD to launch its own parallel computing platform.

I realize this is also an unlikely goal, but if demand surges, AMD may be considered for CUDA

I am fully invested in AMD because I think AMD is trading below its fair price

That said, I think AMD is currently worth about 150-160 fair value

2024-12-16 15:18:27,NVIDIA,NVDA,From GPU to ASIC: Broadcom to capture NVDA  market share!,"Broadcom Surge Highlights the Importance of AI

Let’s start with some expert opinions I read over the weekend about Broadcom’s impressive rally views I completely agree with

At the hardware level, training costs are skyrocketing, limiting participation to a few CSP (cloud service providers) that can afford it.     As economies of scale see diminishing returns, these companies are shifting their strategies toward customer acquisition, commercialization, and retention—similar to Microsoft’s current approach.     With growing focus on model deployment and revenue generation, inference is bound to take center stage.     Open source models are becoming more valuable, enabling AI application developers to focus on building apps rather than training models from scratch.     It’s akin to the role Linux played during the cloud operating system boom.

The traditional scaling laws based on data are nearing a bottleneck.     We’re likely approaching the end of the pretraining era, with the future pointing towards the ""Agent and Reason"" age.

Here’s the key takeaway: Broadcom predicts that by 2027, its three largest existing clients (likely ByteDance, Google, and Meta) will deploy over one million arithmetic card units.     Additionally, two more clients are undergoing validation, potentially driving $60–90 billion in AI-related revenue.    That said, expectations for overall AI capital expenditure changes remain modest.

This shift represents more of a structural change in existing capital allocation.   NVIDIA, which currently dominates with over 75% of the arithmetic card market, may see its lead challenged.     Broadcom’s ASIC solutions and NVIDIA’s GPUs could eventually share the market.    Once AI models stabilize, ASIC—being application-specific—could offer a significant cost advantage over general purpose GPU.

For major cloud providers, the massive capital expenditures have sparked criticism from shareholders.     At this point, these companies must demonstrate revenue growth to justify the spending.

As I write this, AVGO  is soaring again.     Broadcom rise was anticipated, but the market sentiment is electrifying.     Investors are desperately hunting for the next NVDA.     After cashing out Tesla last week, I thought Monday might bring a big move for Tesla.     Instead, Broadcom stole the spotlight.     While Tesla did rise, it couldn’t match Broadcom momentum.

I kinda got this idea in my head that AAPL is a company without much growth left and have been thinking about lightening up my position on it.

So I decided to make some graphs to figure out what to think and because pictures easy raw data hard. 

First off I was curious what apple's shares outstanding looked like. I know their buy back program is massive and I also know they're not growing top line revenue but are spending a ton on buybacks so this was a good place to start. Considering the share price has also been going up a lot and their market cap is massive so I thought buybacks might have a negligible effect. Wow was I wrong. The shares outstanding are down like 36% in ten years! I couldn't ask for a better looking chart. At this rate it'll all be bought back in like 18.9 more years.

Then I was obviously curious about the EPS and decided to graph that. I was less surprised about how this turned out but it did still offer some insights. I hadn't seen before that they had multiple recent periods of EPS decline that they managed to turn around in big ways. And their EPS since covid is surprisingly down less than I thought so that's not so bad.

It doesn't change my opinion that their product lines are basically stagnant and not exactly innovative on a level that would spur a ton of growth, who tf needs another slimmer iPhone, iPad etc and I think that's a pretty widely held belief given the charts.

However, it's pretty crazy to see that they've bought back a 3rd of their shares in the past 9 years. Also pretty wild to see how its EPS has grown despite not a lot of innovation.

Lastly I was curious how their wearables revenue was doing because I heard recently about the FDA approving AirPods to be hearing devices which is probably a huge market? IDK but what I do know is hearing aids are stupid expensive compared to $200 air pods so this could be big. So far it looks like wearables is doing about $9B a quarter so if growth in that picked up it could be meaningful

All in all I think I keep my position the same, especially considering most of it is through SPYG which has AAPL and NVDA nearly the same weights which kinda strikes me as a yin and yang sorta situation.

2024-12-10 23:07:41,NVIDIA,NVDA,Siemens - worth a look? A balanced view.,"Purpose of this post is to get a sense of 'sentiment' about Siemens. It's not a lazy $hit post, asking ""what do y'all think yo""? But yeah, essentially, that's what I am asking, besides listing down a long list of pros and cons of the company.

I've no position yet (long or short), but thinking of it.

Pros:

1. The conglomerate needs no introduction. There's virtually NO piece of any complex, industrial machinery (boats, planes, turbines, large diesel engines, data center infrastructure, heating, cooling, all kinds of factories, power plant, high voltage transformer...) that doesn't have at least a few critical components made by Siemens. The company stands to benefit from **energy transition, mobility, urbanization** (smart cities), and is focused on **high-margin** specialized components.
2. Valuations: 18 PE, 1.9 PS [Siemens AG - Google Finance](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/SIE:ETR?window=YTD)
3. News: there's plenty of positive news and developments [Google News ](https://news.google.com/search?for=siemens&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en) Most notably, partnership with NVDA for industrial robotics applications. Won a few contracts in the middle East. 
4. Gaining momentum: for last 10 days at least, the trading volume is virtually all **BUY volume**. BUY volume means the trades were executed at 'ask' price. Buyers had to up their bids to get hands on the stock.
5. Low retail concentration: only 19% retail shareholders. Less susceptible to 'crowd' thinking. It's not your GME or TSLA which will up/down 10% in a day. Movements will be very slow and steady. In other words, low volatality. It's a steady wealth builder with 14% YTD; don't expect 500% in 5 years.

Cons:

1. German company. Yes, yes, we know Germany is in recession, aging population, generally hard business climate.. etc etc. But the company's operations are global. The only geographical 'risk' is, you've a stock in EUR currency, not traded as ADR on US exchange (as far as I know). Revenues come from all over the world, in many currencies.
2. Lot of competition: ABB, GE, Hitachi, Mitsubishi, Larsen & Toubro.. may not be retail, well known names, but they all do the same stuff, some better; some worse. It's all about winning a large government / private contracts.",17,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hbf2zb/siemens_worth_a_look_a_balanced_view/

1) At what stage of the stock's life would you then decide to stop DCA? Especially for stocks like MSFT and AAPL that have been around for a long while?

2) Also, while you DCA, would you also sell your initial amount you bought? Or you'd let it ride?

2024-11-22 18:41:10,NVIDIA,NVDA,Are we putting too much faith in generative AI? Could this hurt AI investments more broadly?,"Obviously a lot of money is being made off of AI-related stocks. I'm not one of those lucky investors. Part of the reason is that I fear we're not in a general AI bubble, as many have discussed, but rather a *generative AI* bubble. I'd appreciate hearing how others feel about this.

Right now, by far the bulk of investment is focused on generative AI (especially LLMs), with NVDA at or very near the center of it all, thanks to its GPUs. Meanwhile, alternative AI approaches (e.g., neuromorphic computing, symbolic AI, reinforcement learning, and hybrid models) have been getting far less attention.

The problem? As impressive as it may seem, generative AI has some significant (and inherent) drawbacks:

* Factually unreliable outputs (it can’t reliably distinguish fact from fiction)
* Probabilistic reasoning (no true causal understanding)
* High computational costs (questionable sustainability)
* Limited real-world problem-solving abilities

At some point, the reality of generative AI's limitations will become apparent enough to investors that we could see an AI market correction or even collapse. This would not only hurt AI stocks like NVDA, but it could also starve funding for alternative AI approaches that have long-term potential yet have been largely overlooked.

 I won't go into details of thier report, but after reading it I believe it is of very low quality (they even got the ZETAs auditor wrong lol).

After the decline of the price I was tempted to start building a position, especially since the SP was starting to recover. However, today in PM the shares are going back to around 20$. Another short seller (Lauren Balik) has published a report. To me it once again seems like a blatant attempt of trying to lower the price. It is overblown and full of speculation. She also published similiar articles on NVDA, APP, SNOW. But the market is dumping anyway.

My question is - how likely is it going to actually hurt the company long term? Is it too risky to enter now? Do you know of some other companies targeted by mulriple short sellers In the past (I would like to examine how they did or did not recover)?

2024-11-20 05:26:11,NVIDIA,NVDA,Trading SPY for gains,"First time posting, long time lurking.

I had some money ($8k only) sitting at a HYSA and earning 4% interest.
Decided to buy $8k SPY and harvest profit on a day to day basis (meaning, if stock goes up, I withdraw gains. If it goes down, I do nothing).

My HYS was returning $25+ per month. I made $60 in 2 days. And kept $8k on SPY.

What am I missing here? Even if I stop now and don’t sell for the whole month, I still did better than HYSA. 

Are there tax implications (or complications) for realizing lots of micro short term gains? 
I believe the tax bracket of HYSA and short term gains is the same. 
Will my tax be too complicated to file if I keep doing these micro profit withdrawals?

Honestly, I am a new investor (trader?), have been doing index funds and NVDA for less than 1 year (401k solid, maxed out every year, for 8+ years)

1. The first rounds of filtering were based on the overall trend of revenue growth over 20, 10, & 5 years. All must be positive

2. The second round is based on the actual current size of revenue & total equity growth. Generally it must be at least +30% rev & eq combined

3. Third round, consistency. Any ""weird"" financials, inconsistencies are tossed

4. Soft fourth for value, taking into account PEG and other price:financial metrics

My takes:

COST -- Costco has a great expansion model, a great business model, and loyalty like few other companies: customer, employee, and vendors.

AAPL -- I continue to see them innovate, they won't stick with something that isn't working, and their stuff just works.

Third slot is a bit tougher: GOOG, NVDA, or JPM in that order.

2024-10-24 01:39:10,NVIDIA,NVDA,"Nvidia supplier SK Hynix posts record Q3 profit, beats forecasts","SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea's SK Hynix on Thursday posted a record quarterly profit as the Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) supplier saw strong sales of its advanced chips such as high bandwidth memory (HBM) ones used in generative AI chipsets.

The world's second-biggest memory chipmaker reported a 7 trillion won ($5.07 billion) operating profit for the July-September quarter versus a 1.8 trillion won loss a year earlier.

That compared with a 6.8 trillion won average forecast by LSEG SmartEstimate, which is weighted toward analysts who are more consistently accurate.

SK Hynix has outperformed rivals Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) in recent quarters, as it has benefited the most from AI-driven appetite for high-end memory chips following its early entry and large investments in HBM chip development.

""HBM sales showed excellent growth, up more than 70% from the previous quarter and more than 330% from the same period last year,"" SK Hynix said in a statement.

SK Hynix sees HBM sales making up 40% of its total DRAM revenue in the fourth quarter, up from 30% in the third quarter, and added it expects memory chip demand for AI servers to grow further next year as global tech companies continue developing generative AI.

Revenue for the quarter rose 94% year-on-year to 17.6 trillion won.

SK Hynix shares have jumped 38.5% so far this year, outperforming Samsung, whose stocks has slumped 24.7% over the same period.

Last month, SK Hynix, the main supplier of HBM chips to Nvidia, said it had started mass production of HBM3E 12-layer chips and plans to supply the latest products to unidentified customers by the end of this year.",97,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gara3z/nvidia_supplier_sk_hynix_posts_record_q3_profit/

2024-10-18 14:59:12,NVIDIA,NVDA,I Flipped My Entire Portfolio of ETFs for AI Stocks,"Yesterday, I made a major shift in my stock portfolio. I used to rely on ETFs like SPY, QQQ, and SCHD, but now I’ve sold most of them and focused on NVDA, MSFT, GOOGL, ISRG, AAPL, SCHG, and a bit of SOXX.

 - NVDA $237K

 - SCHG $121K

 - MSFT $105K

 - GOOGL $78K

 - AAPL $74K

 - ISRG $64K

 - SOXX $61K

 - BRK-B $47K

Here’s why: Right now, AI might feel limited to things like ChatGPT, but its potential goes far beyond that. Over the next 3, 5, or 10 years, AI is going to transform industries in ways we can’t fully imagine yet. We’re talking about healthcare revolutionizing how we diagnose and treat patients, transportation with autonomous vehicles and drones making logistics smarter and more efficient, and manufacturing, where AI will optimize production processes and supply chains.

Now, I know what you're thinking: 'What, you think the world is full of cave dwellers? Who doesn't know that?' and you're right. Everyone knows AI techonology will be advanced and utilized in so many ways in the near future.

But look, you can think of it like real estate. Sure, property values rise while new highways or shopping centers are being built, but the real surge in value happens once people start using them and see the full benefits. Right now, AI is still in its “under construction” phase—people can imagine the future potential, but the true value hasn’t been fully realized yet. The market has priced in expectations, sure, but once AI is fully integrated across industries and we start seeing its widespread, real-world impact, I believe we’ll see another major surge in stock prices. What’s priced in now is just the beginning—the real growth will come as AI starts transforming daily life and business on a much larger scale.

Before ChatGPT went mainstream, people assumed ‘just’ that level of AI technology would arrive soon enough, but they didn’t think it would have this much of an impact on stock prices once it came to life for the public. Everyone knew advanced AI was on the horizon, but the market didn’t price it like they do now. This shows just how much underestimation happens until we truly start experiencing the technology firsthand. And that’s why, despite what’s already been priced in, I think AI stocks are still undervalued given the game-changing growth ahead. Anyone else rethinking their portfolio with AI at the center?",0,64,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g6k31k/i_flipped_my_entire_portfolio_of_etfs_for_ai/

We all can offer excellent ideas on what companies are great, and which stocks to buy, but I'm looking for easy short ideas, so the inverse function -

* Empty air projections and growth expectations, no moat
* High regulatory risk, e.g. crypto 
* Sky high valuations, abnormal PE, PS ratios 
* Sky high run-up in price, e.g. 70-100% shoot up YTD
* Excessive media attention, which can quickly changes narrative

Couple of ideas that I can think of:

* Tesla (but who knows they might just deliver, finally)
* Walmart (digital is coming, digital is coming since 2010)
* Uber - discretionary spending in recession? Also, it spikes up when Tesla falls, so I don't like the rationale based on other company's failure 
* Vici - casino, hotels, resorts in recession?

No good news which highlights how META uses these cards and any performance benefits in training or inference on MI300.

State of ROCm is not bad. It's improving and many have written blogs and KB articles on how Llama3 models are running without issues on MI300 cards. I read some articles of using Mistral as well. However, AMD still isn't able to demonstrate end to end solutions.

TSMC, as one of NVIDIA’s key partners, often provides valuable insights into NVIDIA's demand and sales. If TSMC reports strong earnings, it could indicate robust demand for semiconductors, which is crucial since NVIDIA relies heavily on TSMC for manufacturing its GPUs. Positive news from TSMC might lead to increased optimism for NVIDIA’s prospects and influence overall market sentiment toward tech stocks. A solid report could create a ripple effect, boosting investor confidence not only in TSMC but also in NVIDIA.

Following TSMC's earnings, analysts may *revise* their ratings or ***price targets*** for NVIDIA, potentially leading to a **spike** in NVDA’s stock price. 

Additionally, with the growing demand for AI and gaming, TSMC's earnings could highlight trends that further support NVIDIA’s growth, especially if they mention strong orders from clients in these sectors. Reports indicate that TSMC is now able to ship more chips than ever before.

Do you believe TSMC’s earnings will positively impact NVIDIA? Are you planning to make any moves based on this news? Let’s discuss!

Current P/E, P/S and most metrics point to stellar growth expectations. If that's the case, why is $200 Call for June 2026 priced 'just' at $15. $240 Call (double of current price) is trading at $10.

[NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Options Chain - Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA/options/?date=1781740800) 

It's an almost certainty that NVDA should double in next 18 months, or even sooner. So why wouldn't someone just get this option for $10, and free up his $110 capital for something else?

I know, the option can become worthless if price stays below $240. But if I am getting into something as volatile as NVDA, I'm looking to 2X my capital; and not 'normal' 20-30% gains. So, isn't it better to just ""throw"" $10 at NVDA option, if the end-result is basically the same as investing $120 in it?",0,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1fvmtmy/june_2026_where_will_nvda_be/
2024-10-02 22:51:26,NVIDIA,NVDA,Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang: “Demand for Blackwell is Insane”,"Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang indicated the demand for its latest GPU, Blackwell, remains on track.


""Blackwell is in full production,"" Huang said Wednesday during an interview with CNBC. ""Blackwell is as planned, and the demand for Blackwell is insane. Everybody wants to have the most, and everybody wants to be first.""


The Blackwell GPUs are already being released to data centers and industrial customers for artificial intelligence applications. They will be available for consumers in 2025.


""The thing that we have done with Blackwell, and what we have announced, is there is new Al infrastructure generation every year,"" Huang said. ""So, we're updating our platform every single year. If we can increase the performance, like we've done for Hopper and Blackwell ... we're effectively increasing the revenue or throughput for our customers on these infrastructures by a couple to three times each year.""


Hyperscalers are expected to spend about $160B in 2024 on Al infrastructure. Every frontier large language model requires many times more compute power than the one prior.

2024-10-01 15:23:05,NVIDIA,NVDA,The Crash of the stock market has arrived. Price/Earnings ratio just broke 30 for the entire S&P 500. ,"Almost 90 days ago I made a post in an alternate subreddit regarding why I believe the stock market will begin to crash within 120 days -- Essentially the crash will begin by the day before the election. I have included that entire post below -- and all of these reasons still remain relevant... Moreso than ever with the news from the Middle East today. Obviously the port strike is expediting things today. Nonetheless -- I think the post is super relevant, and for some reason, the moderators of WSB deleted the post after 6 hours, despite it receiving over 2.2 million views, and over 1100 shares. 

The ride the market has been on, quite simply, has been insane.

According to generally accepted wisdom -- by investing in the S&P 500, you can anticipate to double your money, on average, every 6.5 years. I'm not 100% certain as to why that's the accepted figure -- as calculating the last 14 6.5 year periods the average rate of return has been 64%.

Below is a chart of the average price/rate of return of GSPC (The S&P) over the last 14 cycles.. I couldn't easily find data prior to this..

|Year|GSPC Price|6.5 year return on investment|

|2018|2471.65|87.10%|
|2024.5|5525.29|123%|

While the last two cycles don't necessarily ring any alarm bells -- we have just more than doubled, twice, looking at the last two cycles -- There is one massive, bloated, shit filled elephant in the room... Price to Earnings Ratio.

Historically, the Price to Earnings ratio for the S&P has sat just under 20 (the easiest data I could find puts it at 19.4x between 1974 and 2017 -- I'm not grabbing any arbitrary dates or numbers here). The Median value has it under 18x, and there have even been extended periods of time where it traded at +/- 10x.

Currently -- the P/E ratio sits at 28.71 -- roughly 150% of what is normal.

In the history of the S&P, the P/E ratio has hit this level only 3 times...

* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Dot Com Bubble (P/E broke 30 +/- April 2001).
* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Global Financial Crisis (P/E broke 30 +/- October 2008).
* The quarter after Covid hit. (P/E broke 30 +/- March 2020).

Images aren't allowed in this subreddit -- but if you go to the multpl website you will see we finished trading yesterday, 09/30, at a P/E of 30.07

Historically -- what has happened to the markets after crossing this mark? In all three scenarios, by the time we crossed a P/E of 30, the dam had already started to break.

* During the Dot Com bubble, the S&P 500 was already down 19% from its highs, and would fall another 34% before finally starting to recover. By the the time the bleeding stopped, it had lost 47% of its value.
* During the global financial crisis, an almost identical story can be told. The S&P had lost 18% of its value by time P/E broke 30, and when it finally bottomed out in February of 2009, it lost 53% of its total value.
* Covid, obviously, was a much quicker recovery... as we only fell 32%, and had bounced back in less than 6 months time (reason for which outlined later).

**Okay -- so** ***Maybe*** **we have a price to earnings ratio problem, but you're still not sold. What else do we have going on?**

Outside of the fact that I firmly believe that the market is overvalued today, I think there are several other major issues that we are facing in the current environment -- and while I could write a diatribe for each, for purposes of succinctness, I'll simply outline them via bullet points below.

* Credit card debt is at an all time high, and outside of a brief period after Covid checks arrived, has been rising since 2013.
* Younger Americans are in the most trouble with credit card debt. As boomers continue to retire, it will be the working class most disproportionately affected.
* Credit card delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2011.
* Auto loans debt and average auto loan payments are the highest they've been at any point in history. Auto loan delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2010.
* The stock market is insanely top heavy right now. The Magnificent 7 (Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA)) now account for 45% of the entire value of the Nasdaq. They account for roughly 30% of the entire stock market combined. As of today -- they are trading at a combined P/E of 42x. A correction in these 7 companies would be absolutely catastrophic for the entire market as a whole.
* We are starting to see a weakening of the labor market. Furthermore -- I do not believe the jobs numbers are entirely as they seem. I think many of the jobs 'added' over the last 18 months have been individuals picking up second jobs to help make ends meet. Any reasonable increase in the unemployment rate have absolutely massive consequences.
* Many banks are holding on to massive unrealized losses. While this has the potential to hit the regional banks the worst, some of the largest banks -- including Bank of America, Charles Schwab, and USAA have unbooked security losses that are greater than 50% of their equity capital.
* Regional banks are at risk due to the massive amounts of US treasury notes they hold that were bought during Covid. In short -- nobody was borrowing money to buy homes or cars. Banks, flush with cash, took said money and bought US T notes with this money so they could earn some interest on it. This was at a time when interest rates were very low. Now that interest rates are high -- demand for these old t notes is essentially non existent, as you buy new t notes that pay a much higher rate of return. If any sort of bank run starts, these banks will be forced to liquidate said t-bills, and they will have to sell them at a loss. If too many people do this simultaneously, the bank will become insolvent -- like what we saw happen with Silicon Valley bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank. (Side note -- the failure of these three banks alone was larger than the combined total of bank failures in 2008 during the global financial crisis).
* The US government still has a spending problem. Our deficit has grown by $500 million since I started writing this an hour ago.
* Global tensions are high -- and rising. Massive protests are erupting all over Europe.
* The US is involved in two proxy wars that don't appear as if they will abate any time soon.
* The political division in the US is as dramatic as I've seen it at any point in my existence. Perhaps those older and wiser than me can chime in here -- but it seems most are resorting to tribal, identity politics split down party lines.
* Commercial real estate is starting to buckle. Covid brought about work from home, and with many offices retaining those practices, or allowing partial work from home, office space supply far outpaces demand. This problem is exacerbated by high interest rates. Most commercial loans are done on 5 or 7 year balloon. When that balloon is bout to come due, the owner of that property will refinance the loan, restarting the 5 or 7 year period to avoid paying off the balance owed on the property. Many of these property owners that refinanced into low interest rates in 2020, during covid, when rates bottomed out -- are now having to get a new loan to keep from paying their balloon. However, with interest rates more than twice what they were several years ago, and vacancy rates skyrocketing, many of these real estate owners will not be able to pay the monthly mortgage on their buildings. Commercial Real Estate foreclosures jumped 117% in March alone.
* Housing has become increasingly less affordable for many Americans. For 2022 -- the most recent year I could find data -- a family earning the median US household income, renting a median priced US home, was spending 40% of their income on rent.
* Countries are abandoning the US dollar in droves.

I believe some of these issues, on their own, are enough to cause serious economic turmoil. Bundled together, I don't see how we aren't in for a very rude awakening.

**This economic downturn may be severe.**

In the three times this has happened before -- the action, or lake thereof varied dramatically. During scenario one -- the dot com bubble -- the government largely just let the companies fail. While I was only 11 at the time, my understanding is that there really were no bailouts here because the only people really hurt were the investors in those companies -- unlike scenario two. During the GFC, shuttering banks would have resulted in a complete collapse of the US (and really global) financial system. While I won't get into partisan politics, I'm of the belief that the covid bailouts were entirely unnecessary -- and more importantly for this post -- the reason that the upcoming crash is going to be so insanely problematic.

**Bailouts on any level, whether to companies, banks, or directly to citizens, will inevitably increase inflation. I don't think they are on the table for this correction.**

People have painted the inflation problem as a result of supply chain issues... And while supply chain issues didn't help, I think the bigger issue, by far, was the sheer amount of money we printed. You cannot make $4 trillion appear out of thin air and expect that every dollar in circulation isn't going to suddenly become worth less money. We just lived through this reality after the Covid printing.

This will largely tie the feds hands. Print more money -- we find ourselves in a cycle of ever increasing prices and higher interest rates.

**What happens from here?**

I don't know. Don't listen to me. I'm an idiot. Stock market will probably just continue to go up. I'm probably wrong about 100% of this.

The prediction in bold below is what I posted 90 days ago. I now believe the top is officially in -- that we won't see another ATH for a long time.

2024-09-20 15:12:40,NVIDIA,NVDA,NVDA Bear Case | AI Bubble Collapse | Financial Round Tripping | Thematics,"# Background

It's crucial to understand the concept of financial round-tripping and its implications for the market. Round-tripping is a deceptive practice that has gained notoriety in recent years due to its potential to mislead investors and manipulate financial statements. This fraudulent technique involves creating artificial transactions between two or more entities to inflate revenues, evade taxes, or present a false picture of financial health.

Typically, round-tripping occurs when a company sells an asset to another entity while simultaneously agreeing to buy back the same or a similar asset at approximately the same price. This creates the illusion of bustling business activity and growth, which can be particularly attractive to speculative investors. However, these transactions lack genuine economic substance and violate the fundamental accounting principle of substance over form. Round-tripping has been implicated in several high-profile financial scandals, including those involving energy traders like Enron and CMS Energy, as well as financial service providers such as Wirecard. As an investment advisor, it's essential to be vigilant and look for red flags that might indicate round-tripping, such as unusually high revenue growth without corresponding increases in cash flow or profit margins.

**The practice of major tech companies providing datacenter credits to AI labs and then reporting growth in datacenter and AI usage can indeed be viewed as a form of financial round-tripping**. This strategy raises significant concerns about the authenticity of reported revenue growth, as it creates a cycle where investments return as revenue, inflating metrics without genuine market expansion.

# History of Financial Round Tripping in Tech

 Over the past 20 years, several high-profile cases of round-tripping have emerged in the technology sector, highlighting the prevalence of this deceptive practice. Here are some notable examples:

# Enron Scandal (2001)

While not strictly a tech company, Enron's collapse involved significant round-tripping in energy trading. The company engaged in numerous sham transactions with special purpose entities to inflate revenues and hide debt. These transactions involved selling assets to these entities and then buying them back at similar prices, creating the illusion of bustling business activity.

# Global Crossing (2002)

This telecommunications company was accused of swapping network capacity with other carriers to artificially boost revenue. Global Crossing would sell capacity on its network to another carrier while simultaneously buying an equal amount of capacity from that carrier, with no money changing hands. This practice inflated reported revenues without generating actual cash flow.

# Qwest Communications (2002-2004)

The telecom giant was found to have engaged in round-trip transactions involving the swapping of fiber-optic capacity with other companies. These deals were structured to appear as legitimate sales and purchases, but in reality, they were designed to inflate revenues artificially.

# Computer Associates (2004)

The software company was involved in a $2.2 billion accounting fraud that included round-tripping. They used a practice called the ""35-day month,"" where they kept their books open for an extra few days to record additional revenue from the next quarter, creating a perpetual cycle of inflated earnings.

# Nortel Networks (2007)

The Canadian telecommunications equipment manufacturer was found to have engaged in various accounting irregularities, including round-tripping. They manipulated revenue recognition by recording sales to distributors as final sales, even when the products were likely to be returned.

# Wirecard (2020)

While not exclusively a tech company, Wirecard was a major player in digital payment processing. The company was found to have engaged in massive fraud, including round-tripping transactions. They created fake customer accounts and used a network of partner companies to simulate legitimate business activities, inflating their reported revenues and cash balances.

These examples demonstrate that round-tripping has been a persistent issue in the tech sector, often used to artificially inflate revenues, manipulate stock prices, and deceive investors. The complex nature of technology businesses and their often intangible assets can make it easier to engage in such deceptive practices. However, increased regulatory scrutiny and improved auditing practices have made it more challenging for companies to engage in round-tripping without detection. 

# AI Labs Round Tripping

 

The practice of major tech companies providing datacenter credits to AI labs and then reporting growth in datacenter and AI usage can indeed be viewed as a form of financial round-tripping. This strategy raises significant concerns about the authenticity of reported revenue growth, as it creates a cycle where investments return as revenue, inflating metrics without genuine market expansion.

# Artificial Inflation of Revenue

When tech giants invest in AI startups or provide them with datacenter credits, they essentially create a loop where their initial financial outlay returns to them as revenue. This cycle artificially inflates their cloud and AI service usage metrics, presenting an illusion of robust growth. For example, companies like Amazon Web Services (AWS) have invested billions in AI firms like Anthropic, which then become major consumers of AWS's cloud services. This arrangement leads to an inflated perception of demand for these services, despite the fact that the growth is internally generated rather than stemming from new market participants.

# Lack of Economic Substance

These transactions often lack real economic substance because the AI labs are primarily spending money provided by the tech companies themselves. This means that instead of attracting new, independent customers or generating fresh revenue streams, the tech companies are simply cycling their own funds back into their revenue reports. Such practices can mislead stakeholders into believing that there is a substantial increase in market demand when, in reality, the growth is not driven by external factors.

# Misleading Market Perception

# Inflated Growth Figures

By reporting increased usage of their cloud and AI services due to these internal transactions, tech companies create a misleading picture of sector growth. This self-generated growth does not reflect broader market demand but rather a strategic manipulation to enhance financial statements. As highlighted by industry analysts, this practice can give an impression of thriving business activity that may not exist.

# Skewed Competition Metrics

This practice also distorts the competitive landscape by making it appear that certain companies are outperforming others in attracting AI business. In reality, these companies are subsidizing usage through investments and credits, which can skew competition metrics and obscure true market dynamics.

# Financial Interdependence

The symbiotic relationship created between tech giants and AI labs through these arrangements can lead to reduced innovation. AI labs may become overly reliant on specific cloud providers for resources, limiting their ability to explore diverse technological solutions. Additionally, this interdependence can result in conflicts of interest in the development and deployment of AI technologies, as the success of the startups becomes closely tied to the continued support from their benefactor companies.

# Regulatory and Accounting Concerns

# Revenue Recognition Issues

Questions arise regarding how these transactions should be accounted for. If a company invests in an AI startup and subsequently recognizes revenue from that startup's usage of its services, it creates a complex accounting situation that may not accurately reflect the company's true financial position. This ambiguity opens up potential for manipulation, as companies could use these arrangements to meet growth targets or analyst expectations.

# Potential for Manipulation

The practice opens the door for potential manipulation of financial statements. Companies might engage in these arrangements to artificially boost reported revenues, thereby meeting or exceeding market expectations without actual underlying business growth.

# Market Distortion

This practice can lead to a distorted view of the AI and cloud computing markets. By overestimating market size and growth rates based on inflated projections from round-tripping deals, resources may be misallocated. This could potentially create an AI bubble driven by circular investments rather than genuine demand. 

# Conclusion

In conclusion, while providing resources to AI labs can drive innovation, the current practice of offering datacenter credits and reporting resulting usage as growth shares similarities with financial round-tripping. It raises significant concerns about transparency, authenticity in corporate reporting, and potential distortions in market perceptions within the AI and cloud computing sectors.

# TLDR;

The practice of tech giants providing datacenter credits to AI labs and then reporting the resulting usage as growth is essentially a modern form of financial round-tripping. This deceptive cycle artificially inflates revenue and usage metrics, creating a false perception of market demand. It distorts the competitive landscape, potentially stifles innovation, and raises serious regulatory concerns. Most alarmingly, it could be fueling an AI bubble based on circular investments rather than genuine market growth. Investors and regulators should be wary of this practice, as it may be masking the true state of the AI and cloud computing markets, potentially leading to misallocation of resources and inflated valuations in the tech sector.",0,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1flee3n/nvda_bear_case_ai_bubble_collapse_financial_round/

2024-09-18 14:34:47,NVIDIA,NVDA,Wash sale rule Explanation- Am I understanding this right?,"I made a lot of trades in 2024, I was up 50k at one point and then gave back almost all the profit and I am only up around 4k currently for 2024. I am assuming I only have to pay capital gains taxes on 4k profit for the year, not 50k or some figure more than my overall gains of 4k because of wash sale rule. I did lot of day trading and buying same stock within 30 days of selling and I wanted to understand the implications of wash sale rule. I currently have sold all my positions and do not hold any stock/options and I am up 4k on the year.

Example 1: I bought NVDA calls on August 14, sold on August 15 for gains of 5k. Then I bought NVDA calls on August 20 and sold on August 25 for loss of 3k. I did this several times with NVDA stock and options and have profit of 20k from NVDA and loss of 19k with overall net gain of around 1k on NVDA. I am trying to understand wash sale rule and my understanding is I only have to pay capital gains taxes for 1k on NVDA. My cost basis on my second purchase gets adjusted from profit on first purchase and my cost basis for third purchase gets adjusted based on profit/loss from second sell and so on for future purchase. Is this correct statement? Also, I currently do not hold any NVDA stocks or options, I sold them all.

Example 2: I did same thing with AMZN stock too. I bought calls, sold for some loss, bought more calls within 30 days and sold for some profit and rinse and repeat. I did this multiple times throughout the year.

I traded mostly tech stocks and at one point was in profit in excess of 50k. However I did not sell at the top and the stocks came crashing down and I lost all my profit. At one point I lost all profit and was 20k down on my cost basis too. I was able to recover my loss and I am up 4k in the year. I am now thinking about my Uncle sam and how much does he want for 2024. With no current positions in any stock/options currently, my thinking is just taxes on 4k profit. Let me know if I am wrong or if there is something that I am overlooking and if I need to put more money away for my taxes.",0,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1fjuboe/wash_sale_rule_explanation_am_i_understanding/

2024-09-14 14:58:14,NVIDIA,NVDA,NVDA Bear Case | AI Bubble Collapse | Falsifying the Scalability Hypothesis | Thematics,"# Background

 The AI scaling hypothesis is a key concept in artificial intelligence research that suggests improvements in AI capabilities can be achieved primarily by increasing the size and computational resources of AI models. We can understand several aspects of this hypothesis:

Key Points of the AI Scaling Hypothesis

1. **Emergence of Capabilities**: As AI models grow larger and are trained on more data, they tend to develop new capabilities that were not explicitly programmed. This emergence of novel abilities is a central tenet of the scaling hypothesis.
2. **Generalization**: Larger models demonstrate improved ability to generalize across different tasks and domains, often showing surprising competence in areas they were not specifically trained for.
3. **Efficiency in Learning**: Scaled-up models can learn more efficiently from limited data, sometimes matching or surpassing the performance of smaller, task-specific models with just a few examples.
4. **Continuous Improvement**: The hypothesis suggests that continuing to scale up models will lead to further improvements in AI performance and capabilities, potentially approaching or even surpassing human-level abilities in various domains.

# Hyperscalers and First Mover Advantage

The scaling hypothesis has been a driving force behind many recent advancements in AI, including large language models and multimodal AI systems. However, it's important to note that while scaling has proven effective, it also comes with challenges such as increased computational requirements and potential biases in large datasets.

Hyperscalers are racing to scale their AI capabilities and be ***the first to discover emergent properties for several compelling reasons at any cost. This is the main driver in the billions of capital expenditures over the last 18 months.*** At the forefront is the significant competitive advantage that comes with pioneering new AI capabilities in the fast-evolving tech landscape. Being first allows these companies to establish market dominance, attract and retain customers seeking cutting-edge AI solutions, and gain valuable insights from early deployments. This advantage is not merely about prestige; it translates directly into substantial economic benefits.

The economic incentives driving this race are staggering. Industry projections suggest that AI technology in data centers alone could drive spending of up to $2 trillion over the next five years. Additionally, the AI silicon market is expected to reach $400 billion by 2027. These figures underscore the massive financial opportunity that awaits those who lead in AI capabilities. Hyperscalers are positioning themselves to capitalize on the growing demand for custom AI silicon and infrastructure, potentially securing a significant share of this burgeoning market.

The rush to scale is also fueled by the promise of technological breakthroughs. ***The AI scaling hypothesis suggests that continued increases in model size and computational resources will lead to the emergence of novel capabilities not explicitly programmed, improved generalization across different tasks and domains, and more efficient learning from limited data***\*.\* This potential for transformative advancements keeps hyperscalers intensely focused on pushing the boundaries of AI scale.

Hyperscalers are uniquely positioned in this race due to their existing infrastructure advantages. They possess the necessary computational resources, data centers, and cloud infrastructure that can be leveraged for AI training and deployment. This allows them to offer scalable AI services to a wide range of customers, from individuals to large enterprises, further cementing their market position.

Strategically, leading in AI capabilities allows hyperscalers to shape the future direction of AI development and applications, influence industry standards, and attract top AI talent and research partnerships. The potential for breakthrough discoveries, including the possibility of approaching or surpassing human-level abilities in various domains or even developing artificial general intelligence (AGI), adds another layer of motivation to their efforts.

# Falsifying the Scalability Hypothesis

The AI scaling hypothesis has been a driving force behind many recent advancements in artificial intelligence, but there are compelling arguments for how it could potentially be falsified

One primary method would be ***to demonstrate diminishing returns as models are scaled up in size and computational resources.*** ***If performance gains plateau or even decline rather than continuing to improve linearly or superlinearly, it would suggest fundamental limits to scaling***. This could be coupled with identifying qualitative gaps – cognitive abilities or tasks that larger models consistently fail at, even as they improve on other benchmarks. Such findings would indicate that some fundamental capabilities are missing and cannot be addressed by pure scaling alone.

# Simple Bench

Simple bench is the only reasoning benchmark written in natural language at which English-speaking humans (and yes, even 'smart highschoolers') can score 90%+, while frontier LLMs get less than 50%. It is an encapsulation of the reasoning deficit found in AI like ChatGPT.

 What the benchmark does is take a standard kind of logic puzzle that people ask LLM's, then spikes it with a ""surprise twist"" that requires what we would think of as common sense.  Thus an AI has more difficulty in predicting the next tokens because of the twist.  But humans can still reason out an answer.

These questions are fully private, preventing contamination, and have been vetted by PhDs from multiple domains, as well as the author - Philip, from AI Explained - who first exposed the numerous errors in the MMLU (Aug 2023). \[https://simple-bench.com/about.html\]

|GPT-4o|Not publicly disclosed|
|Claude|Not publicly disclosed|
|||

***These large AI companies don’t disclose training parameter sizes because we can graph training size vs benchmark score to falsify the scalability hypothesis.***

The AI scaling hypothesis has been a driving force behind significant advancements in artificial intelligence, propelling the development of increasingly powerful models and fueling a race among hyperscalers to achieve breakthrough capabilities. This hypothesis has led to remarkable improvements in AI performance across various domains, from natural language processing to computer vision and beyond.

However, as we delve deeper into the realm of large-scale AI models, we are beginning to encounter signs that suggest the scaling hypothesis may have limitations. The emergence of benchmarks like Simple Bench, which reveal persistent reasoning deficits in even the most advanced language models, indicates that simply increasing model size and computational resources may not be sufficient to achieve human-level reasoning capabilities.

The reluctance of major AI companies to disclose training parameter sizes for their latest models adds another layer of intrigue to this discussion. ***This lack of transparency makes it challenging for the broader scientific community to accurately assess the relationship between model scale and performance, potentially hindering efforts to validate or falsify the scaling hypothesis.***

Moreover, the increasing costs associated with training and deploying ever-larger models, coupled with concerns about data scarcity and computational limitations, raise questions about the long-term sustainability of the scaling approach. As we approach these practical and theoretical limits, it becomes clear that the future of AI advancement may require more than just scaling up existing architectures.

Looking ahead, the field of AI research may need to pivot towards more innovative approaches that focus on qualitative improvements in model architecture, training methodologies, and data utilization. The development of more sophisticated benchmarks, like Simple Bench, that can effectively measure complex reasoning abilities will be crucial in guiding these efforts.

Ultimately, while the scaling hypothesis has undoubtedly driven remarkable progress in AI, its limitations are becoming increasingly apparent. The next frontier in AI research may lie not in building ever-larger models, but in developing more efficient, adaptable, and truly intelligent systems that can match or exceed human-level reasoning across a wide range of tasks. This shift could lead to a new paradigm in AI development, one that combines the insights gained from scaling with novel approaches to create more capable and robust artificial intelligence.

# AI Bubble Collapse and Trillions in Misallocated Capital

 The AI scaling hypothesis has been the cornerstone of recent advancements in artificial intelligence, driving unprecedented investments and fueling a race among tech giants to build ever-larger models. However, as we stand on the precipice of a potential paradigm shift, the falsification of this hypothesis could trigger a seismic disruption in the AI industry, potentially leading to the collapse of what many now recognize as an AI bubble.

The signs of this impending crisis are becoming increasingly apparent. Benchmarks like Simple Bench are exposing critical reasoning deficits in even the most advanced language models, defying the expectation that larger models inherently lead to more intelligent systems. The reluctance of major AI companies to disclose training parameter sizes for their latest models further fuels suspicion that the relationship between scale and performance may not be as straightforward as once believed.

 As the evidence mounts against the scaling hypothesis, we must confront the sobering reality of the potential misallocation of trillions of dollars in capital. Hyperscalers and investors have poured vast resources into the development of massive data centers, custom AI chips, and enormous models, all predicated on the belief that bigger is inherently better. If this foundational assumption proves false, the repercussions will be far-reaching and profound.

The collapse of the AI bubble, triggered by the falsification of the scaling hypothesis, could lead to:

1.  A dramatic reassessment of the valuations of AI-focused companies, potentially wiping out billions in market capitalization.

2.  A crisis of confidence in the AI industry, leading to a sharp decline in investment and a potential ""AI winter.""

**This potential collapse serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of putting too much faith in a single hypothesis**, no matter how compelling it may seem. It underscores the critical importance of diverse approaches in AI research and the need for rigorous, independent verification of claims made by industry leaders.

2024-09-11 22:48:01,NVIDIA,NVDA,Summarized comments from Jensen Huang from today's GS Conference,"1) Jensen once again highlights his view that Moore's Law no longer delivers the rate of innovation that's needed and causes computation inflation in Data Center. As such, the rebuilding of $1T data center infrastructure that's currently installed will drive growth over the next 10 years, bringing material performance improvement and cost savings

  
2) ROI: Jensen reiterates that while using a GPU to augment a CPU will drive an increase in cost in nominal terms (roughly 2x), in the case of Spark (a distributed processing system and analytics engine for big data), the net cost benefit could be as large as 10x as the application will be sped up 20x.

  
From a top line generation, he shares that hyperscale customers can generate $5 in rental revenue for every $1 spent on NVDA GPUs, given sustained strength in the demand for accelerated computing.

  
3) With respect to Nvidia's moat, Jensen highlights that the large install base of NVDA GPUs across multiple platforms, ability to augment their hardware with their proprietary software, and ability to build rack-level systems and innovate across various chips creates an insurmountable moat.

  
4) Jensen once again compliments his supply chain partners, highlighting TSMC for being the reason for NVDA's exponential revenue growth in 2H23/2024. That being said, he did note that NVDA has adequate in-house IP to shift manufacturing without material disruption if needed. He also stressed that companies are relentlessly demanding new chips so they can be first, to the point where tensions are rising as they demand their chips now.

  
5) The most important part: Jensen reiterated that the company will begin shipping Blackwell chips in 4Q25 and that shipments will scale in FY26 (Note that NVDA is currently in 3Q25 for their accounting calendar). Demand for Blackwell is incredibly strong and he feels that NVDA has a personal responsibility to ensure all companies are able to obtain the supplies needed to develop AI",189,44,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1fenhlm/summarized_comments_from_jensen_huang_from_todays/

2024-09-04 13:00:41,NVIDIA,NVDA,[Reuters Exclusive] Intel manufacturing business suffers setback as Broadcom tests disappoint,"Sept 4 (Reuters) - Intel's (INTC.O), contract manufacturing business has suffered a setback after tests with chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO.O), failed, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, dealing a blow to the company's turnaround efforts.

The tests conducted by Broadcom involved sending silicon wafers - the foot-wide discs on which chips are printed - through Intel's most advanced manufacturing process known as 18A, the sources said. Broadcom received the wafers back from Intel last month. After its engineers and executives studied the results, the company concluded the manufacturing process is not yet viable to move to high-volume production.

Reuters could not determine the current relationship between Broadcom and Intel or whether Broadcom had decided to walk away from a potential manufacturing deal.

""Intel 18A is powered on, healthy and yielding well, and we remain fully on track to begin high volume manufacturing next year,"" an Intel spokesperson said in a statement. ""There is a great deal of interest in Intel 18A across the industry but, as a matter of policy, we do not comment on specific customer conversations.""

A Broadcom spokesperson said the company is ""evaluating the product and service offerings of Intel Foundry and have not concluded that evaluation.""

Intel's contract manufacturing business was launched in 2021 as a key part of Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger's turnaround strategy.

Broadcom is not a household name but makes crucial networking gear and radio chips that helped generate $28 billion in overall chip sales in its last fiscal year. It has benefited from the boom in spending on artificial intelligence hardware, and J.P. Morgan analyst Harlan Sur estimated it will bank $11 billion to $12 billion from AI this year, up from $4 billion last year.

Some of its chip sales are from agreements with companies such as Alphabet's (GOOGL.O), Google and Meta Platforms (META.O), to help produce in-house AI processors, which can include arrangements with a manufacturer, such as Intel or Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW),.

**CRUCIAL SETBACK**

As part of a disastrous second-quarter earnings report that shaved more than a quarter from the company's market value, Intel announced a 15% job cut and a reduction in capital spending related to its factory construction. Gelsinger and other executives will present a plan to the board of directors in mid-September on possible cuts to business units and teams to reduce costs, Reuters reported on Sunday.

Intel has committed to about $100 billion of expansion and new factory construction at several sites in the U.S. A crucial part of the company's expansion includes attracting big customers such as Nvidia (NVDA.O), or Apple (AAPL.O), to fill up capacity at all its new sites.

Intel reported a $7 billion operating loss for the foundry business, wider than the $5.2 billion in losses the year earlier. Executives expect the contract chip business to achieve breakeven in 2027.

Typically fabricating an advanced chip requires more than 1,000 separate steps inside a chip factory, or fab, and takes roughly three months to complete. Production success is determined by the number of working chips on each silicon wafer. Achieving a substantial yield is crucial to move to producing the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of wafers demanded by big chip designers.

Broadcom's engineers had concerns with the viability of the process, the sources said. Typically that refers to the number of defects on each wafer or the quality of the chips fabricated.

For an advanced manufacturing process used by TSMC, the Taiwanese giant charges roughly $23,000 per wafer at high volume, according to two sources familiar with wafer pricing. Reuters could not determine Intel's wafer pricing.

TSMC declined to comment on its wafer pricing.

Moving a chip design from a manufacturing process used by a company such as TSMC to another vendor such as Samsung (005930.KS), or Intel can take months and requires dozens of engineers, depending on the complexity of the chip and the differences in manufacturing technology.

Betting on a new manufacturing process such as Intel's 18A is impossible for some smaller chip companies because doing so would require resources they do not have.

Intel released its manufacturing tool kit for its 18A process to other chipmakers over the summer, Gelsinger said on an earnings call last month.

The company plans to be ""manufacturing-ready"" by the end of this year for its own chips and begin high volume production for external customers in 2025, Gelsinger said. At an investor conference last week, he said there are a dozen customers ""actively engaged"" with the tool kit.

*****

2024-09-04 11:08:35,NVIDIA,NVDA,Why are people opposed to antitrust probes or merger blocks?,"Antitrust courts and merger blocks are necessary for a competitive market to work for all economic actors in a capitalist system. There are countless economy studies about it and how it is actually better for all economic actors to not have monopolies, duopolies etc.  

Now reading comments on this sub, it seems like people are experts in this difficult domain of antitrust law and almost always side with the companies that potentially break the law. 

Why is that? Even if you have shares in that company, you will end up better by having a competitive market. I.e. we are all nvidia shareholders if you bought S&P, but it would be better for other companies (and long-term for S&P) to fight a monopoly if there is one and ensure that the rules are respected and nobody abuses a monopoly. 

To me this anti FTC, anti DOJ reaction is short sighted and hurts the long term interests of all shareholders, no matter what shares you bought.

30% of my portfolio is GOOG stock and I believe the DoJ case is the best thing that happens to them. A monopolist is lazy, ineficient, not innovating enough because they have their revenue secured. No matter the DoJ decision, it will be breaking the status quo and push GOOG to innovate and create more value for shareholders. The same thing for NVDA. Long term, the worst for them is to be a monopolist and maintain the status quo. Until they become Boeing.

TLDR: No matter what stock you bought, if you are in for the long term, it is in your interest for all the companies to play by the rules and have a competitive, anti-monopolistic, market.",98,79,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1f8qi4h/why_are_people_opposed_to_antitrust_probes_or/
2024-09-02 04:09:41,NVIDIA,NVDA,Thinking about selling part of an ETF to buy NVDA stock,"I have an ETF from Vanguard Admiral Shares (VFIAX). One of the top ten holdings is NVDA.  I want to sell about 10K worth to buy NVDA if it falls close to 100. I already own NVDA which I bought 3 years ago at 30. Since then, those shares have outperformed anything else in my portfolio. My reasoning: NVDA will outperform the ETF.

I believe NVDA will see explosive growth in the next 5 years, beyond that timeframe, who knows. I plan to hold it for at least 5 years (or until I see weakness). 

I should add that this ETF was inherited and will need to be liquidated by 2030.

2024-08-29 20:16:27,NVIDIA,NVDA,Is Intel a good investment for the next 5 - 10 years?,"Hello, just as the title says.

INTC seems like its down in the dumps at the moment, and doesn't have any sign of immanent revival. Where do you guys see this company and stock in the next 5 - 10 years? The stock is valued at $20 at the moment of writing, I'm just wondering if this is the time to jump into INTC since they are starting to invest in GPUs and I see them trailing behind NVDA in the next 5 years. Perhaps getting into data centres and the consumer market.

If they get their act together, this could be their ""Nvidia"" moment where they start pulling up again. Being backed by the US government means that they don't want it to fail. If Taiwan is invaded there will be massive pressure on INTC's fabricators. We have seen this once before with AMD stock falling to $2 a share, where it now sits at $145.

# [Stock futures rise as Wall Street looks to rebound from Wednesday’s pullback: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/28/stock-market-today-live-updates-.html)

*****
> Stock futures rose Thursday, as investors looked to recover from declines seen in the previous session. Wall Street also appeared to shake off a post-earnings decline in Nvidia.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were up 247 points, or 0.6%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures climbed 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively.
*****
> Nvidia shares were down 4% after posting its latest earnings Wednesday afternoon. In its fiscal second quarter, the AI chipmaker exceeded expectations on the top and bottom lines, and issued a rosy current-quarter sales outlook.
*****
> “Death, taxes, and NVDA beats on earnings are three things you can bank on. Here’s the issue, the size of the beat this time was much smaller than we’ve been seeing. Even future guidance was raised, but again not by the tune from previous quarters,” wrote Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group.
*****
> “This is a great company that is still growing revenue at 122%, but it appears the bar was just set a tad too high this earnings season,” Detrick added.
*****
> That decline was offset by a pop in Salesforce. Shares traded 5% higher after the business software giant beat fiscal second-quarter estimates and raised its full-year profit outlook.
*****
> Wall Street is coming off a losing session after a slump in Nvidia shares ahead of the company’s earnings results weighed on the major averages. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.12%, while the S&P 500 fell 0.6%. The 30-stock Dow slid about 159 points, or 0.39%.
*****
> Those moves highlight the growing significance of Nvidia to the broader market. The semiconductor company, which passed the $3 trillion market cap this year to briefly become the world’s most valuable public company, now accounts for roughly 7% of the S&P 500.

The company’s third-quarter revenue outlook, which would represent 80% growth compared to the same period a year ago, failed to meet the higher end of investor’s expectations and would mark a slowdown vs the July quarter.

2024-08-28 20:27:41,NVIDIA,NVDA,Nvidia reports 122% revenue growth on surging demand for data center chips,"Nvidia reported earnings after the bell that beat Wall Street expectations for earnings and guidance, and provided stronger-than-expected guidance for the current quarter.

Nvidia shares fell nearly 4% in extended trading.

Here are the results.

Earnings per share: 68 cents adjusted versus 64 cents per share expected by LSEG.

Revenue: $30.04 billion versus $28.7 billion expected by LSEG.

Nvidia said it expected about $32.5 billion in current quarter revenue, versus $31.77 billion expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.

Nvidia is the primary beneficiary of the ongoing artificial intelligence boom. Its market value has expanded more than nine times since the end of 2022 and was up 34% since the company’s last earnings report.  

Nvidia said it approved $50 billion in share buybacks.

2024-08-28 18:14:29,NVIDIA,NVDA,Is it better to invest in the entire market or wait to buy in ETFs for certain sectors?,"I've been told and have read in countless investing and stock market books to buy the entire market using VOO and SCHD and that is all I need to do. Just literally every paycheck or every whenever put in as much as I can and keep buying. If the ultimate goal is to make money with as little risk of possible this may in fact be the way. However is it not better to buy not every paycheck or month but instead buy only when the market is down say 8% for the week? We have those weeks at least 3X a year it seems and that might be the way. The only counter to this is that if you are in a bull market and wait for the 8% dip you will eventually get the 8% dip. It may be after the market has ran up 20% though so you lost out of those gains. 

Is it better to invest in VOO and SCHD or is it better to buy up sector ETFs? Say energy is the worst performer of the last 18 months. It is bound to start going up again, right? So why not invest instead of in VOO or SCHD but instead only in ETFs looking at sectors when they are not performing well since almost all sectors do well over the mid and all do well over the long run. The only counter I see to this again like above is you may be missing out by not being in the market long enough. If you instead just invest in VOO and SCHD you will come out ahead unless we have a major recession or even depression (and at that point I'm stocking up on canned goods and buying shelter equipment). If you wait until say energy is down to the worst performing sectors then you will loose out by not being equally in all areas of the market... So long story short I think the answer is to just buy VOO and SCHD and go from there. I don't even recommend buying individual stocks anymore tbh. The only exception to this is AST Spacemobile bc I see ASTS going up another 200% over the next year and that could make $10k turn into $20k+ very quick. I also believe NVDA is going to keep going over the next 3 years. Heck even if we somehow have a recession I think NVDA by late 2027 will easily be 2X from where it is right now. People saying to back off it right now are crazy. ",0,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1f3h7sw/is_it_better_to_invest_in_the_entire_market_or/

# [S&P 500 futures tick lower as Wall Street looks toward Nvidia earnings: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/27/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> S&P 500 futures inched lower Tuesday night as investors waited in anticipation for chipmaker Nvidia’s quarterly earnings announcement Wednesday after the bell.
*****
> Futures tied to the broad market index slipped 0.16%, while Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 0.31%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures lost 18 points, or 0.04%.
*****
> In after-hours action, Nordstrom advanced 7% after the retailer posted adjusted earnings in the second quarter that surpassed expectations. Semiconductor developer Ambarella jumped nearly 20% on upbeat revenue guidance in the third quarter. PVH, owner of Calvin Klein, slumped more than 7% on a disappointing outlook for the current quarter.
*****
> During Tuesday’s trading session, the broad market index and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite both added nearly 0.2%. Nvidia posted a roughly 1.5% gain that helped buoy both indexes. The 30-stock Dow, meanwhile, added just 0.02% — just enough to post a second straight record close.
*****
> Wall Street is keeping an eye on Nvidia, the leader of the artificial intelligence trade, to gauge the broader sustainability of the broader tech and AI trade. The semiconductor giant has surged 159% in 2024, raising questions of how much more room there is for the stock to run.
*****
> Focal points for investors include the delivery schedule for Nvidia’s Blackwell chips and an update on the demand for AI.
*****
> “It’s hard to say that there’s not a lot of optimism priced into the market tomorrow,” Erin Browne, Pimco managing director and portfolio manager, told CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Tuesday.
*****
> Browne noted that other AI stocks are trading around 10% below their all-time highs. Nvidia’s current valuation is not expensive relative to the five-year average, she added.
*****
> “So while certainly there’s a lot of optimism priced in, I think that they still can deliver upside and surprise the market to the upside,” Browne said.
*****
> Elsewhere on the earnings front, Bath & Body Works, Foot Locker and Kohl’s are some of the names slated to report their quarterly results Wednesday morning. In addition to Nvidia in the afternoon, investors will also be looking toward Salesforce’s earnings.

I (think), I hit most of the semiconductor names, except NVDA. For some reason, it never felt like a good investment. I have my skepticism about LLMs and Gen-AI hype. Besides, generating cat pics or idle plays with Chat-GPT, I haven't ***yet*** seen a business effectively using Gen-AI as a compelling competitive edge. So, please educate me here as well. AMD is different because of data center servers product line - which is more solid story.

Besides missing such obvious biggies, not all of what I touched has performed. I felt, European carmakers (BMW, VW, MBG) were deep value at PE 3-5 and 8-9% yields, but obviously I was wrong. They were cheap for a reason.

**Main question** - I was wondering if I can do a simulation of hypothetical scenario where I had simply invested in index, saving me enormous time in research. If so, please suggest tools/sites?

Note that the amounts and time of entry/exit are not constant, so I can't use the simple lumpsum or periodic investing calculators that assume regular constant amounts and intervals.

With 50 stocks in my portfolio, I wonder if it is just mirroring the index, or generating any real alpha. Obviously, when I buy something, I am highly convinced of my reasonings. So, it's hard to part with what I feel are ""my gems"". How do you cope with these emotional aspects of investing?",113,170,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1eyjtg8/how_many_stocks_is_too_many_i_hold_50_now_better/

All of my positions excluding INTC (which is only slightly down) are heavy in the green. I’m quite happy with my gains (4 are 45%+)so far in just a few weeks. I think the upcoming rate cuts signaled by the Fed Minutes released today will propel the market further forward, assuming Friday goes as expected. I’m still holding all my call positions. I feel many of you were overly pessimistic on my original post but I forgive you. Did I do good? Should I sell? How do you all feel the market will fare the rest of the year? Cheers 🥂

Agencies and staff reporter

Nvidia said it was on track to ramp up production of its most advanced artificial intelligence chip, following reports of a delay in its launch due to design flaws.

Tech journal The Information had reported that design flaws on its new Blackwell chip could cause a delay of three months or more and the setback could affect customers such as Meta Platforms, Alphabet's Google and Microsoft, which have collectively ordered tens of billions of US dollars' worth of chips.

The chip giant's Blackwell series succeeds its earlier flagship AI chip, the Grace Hopper Superchip.

In response, a Nvidia spokesman said ""Hopper demand is very strong, broad Blackwell sampling has started, and production is on track to ramp in the second half.""",299,62,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ek8azi/nvda_says_ai_chips_on_track_amid_fears/

2024-08-02 13:50:51,NVIDIA,NVDA,"US launches antitrust probe into Nvidia over sales practices, The Information reports","Aug 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice has launched an investigation into Nvidia (NVDA.O) after complaints from competitors that it may have abused its market dominance in selling chips that power artificial intelligence, The Information reported on Thursday.

Shares of the company fell around 3.6% in premarket trading on Friday.

DOJ investigators are looking at whether Nvidia pressured cloud providers to buy multiple products, the report said, citing people involved in the discussions.

The investigation is also looking into whether Nvidia charges its customers more for networking gear if they want to buy AI chips from rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O) and Intel (INTC.O), it added.

Nvidia commands roughly 80% of the AI chip market.

The company did not comment on the report, but said that it would provide any information that regulators require.

""We compete based on decades of investment and innovation, scrupulously adhering to all laws, making Nvidia openly available in every cloud and on-prem for every enterprise, and ensuring that customers can choose whatever solution is best for them,"" a Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement to Reuters.

The DOJ did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment late Thursday.

The report said that investigators have reached out to several of Nvidia's competitors to gather more details.

U.S. progressive groups and Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren have pressed the DOJ to investigate Nvidia over competition concerns.

The groups, which oppose monopolies and promote government oversight of tech companies, among other issues, took aim at Nvidia's bundling of software and hardware, a practice that French antitrust enforcers have also flagged as they prepare to bring their own charges.

2024-08-01 18:13:46,NVIDIA,NVDA,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

|+|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

2024-07-31 23:02:59,NVIDIA,NVDA,"Nasdaq, S&P 500 post best day since Feb after Powell signals possible rate cut in Sept","The three major U.S. averages on Wednesday ended solidly higher, after Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said an interest rate cut ""could be on the table as soon as September"" if data on inflation and the labor market continued to improve.
Powell's remarks, along with a powerful rebound in chip stocks, helped the Nasdaq Composite (COMP:IND) and the benchmark S&P 500 (SP500) post their best intraday gain each since February 22.


The Nasdaq Composite climbed 2.64% to settle at 17,599.40 points, while the S&P 500 closed out the final day of the month with an advance of 1.58% to 5,522.30 points. The blue-chip Dow (DJI) added 0.24% to conclude at 40,843.06 points.


U.S. Treasury yields moved lower after Powell's comments, as traders snapped up bonds. The longer-end 10-year yield (US10Y) fell to its lowest level since March, dropping 7 basis points to 4.032%.

Earlier, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) held the federal funds rate steady at 5.25%-5.50%, a largely given outcome.


The attention was on Powell's post-decision press conference, amid hopes that the central bank chief would talk about interest rate cuts in September. And Powell did not disappoint.


He signaled that policymakers could be considering an interest rate cut as soon as September if they continued to see inflation moving quickly or in line with their expectations, growth remaining reasonably strong and the labor market staying consistent with its current conditions.


According to the CME FedWatch tool, the odds of a 50 basis point rate cut in September climbed after Powell's comments, underscoring the market's confidence that the monetary policy easing cycle was imminent. There is now a 90.5% chance of a 25 bp cut, a 9.5% chance of a 50 bp cut, and a 0.0% chance of a 0 bp cut.

Nvidia (NVDA) surged 17%, after Morgan Stanley re-added the chip giant to its top picks list following the stock's recent selloff. In addition, Microsoft and Meta reiterated and increased their capital expenditure investments, signaling further revenue upside for Nvidia. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) climbed 4%, after the world's second-largest maker of personal computer processors issued current quarter revenue guidance that was above consensus estimates.

Microsoft (MSFT) slipped 1%, after the tech behemoth's cloud business missed on revenue and its quarterly capital expenditure swelled to $19B.


Turning to Wednesday's economic calendar, ADP's jobs report before the opening bell showed private sector employment growing by 122K in July, significantly lower than the consensus figure of 154K. Shortly after, a key gauge of Q2 U.S. labor costs rose lesser than anticipated while also slowing down from the previous quarter.",232,68,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1eh18cy/nasdaq_sp_500_post_best_day_since_feb_after/

I am bullish on NVDA but I want a rainy day insurance.

So I bought 100 Put LEAPS (Dec 2026). I paid 20 USD/share premium for that. 

https://optionstrat.com/build/protective-put/NVDA/NVDAx100,.NVDA261218P100

That's how my positions look like. Until Dec 2026, my max loss will stay at USD 2865 while I have potential for unlimited profit.

I am happy with it. That covers my 100/150 shares.

My remaining 50 shares still need insurance. I wonder what I can do about it? I don't want to under-hedge or over-hedge. Is there any trick I should know?",0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1efw8gg/how_to_hedge_shares_when_option_contract_size_is/

2024-07-22 23:05:58,NVIDIA,NVDA,Wheeling stocks $NDVA $GME $DJT $AVGO and option play on $PFE and thoughts on future plays. ,"I’m somewhat new to trading so I’m being conservative by just selling covered calls or cash puts. 

Total gain today (and likely for the week) was 704.82

Overall I’ve made 7851.91 since 21 June and I thought I’d start sharing what I’m doing. It’s modest gain but it’s something. 

 $NVDA CC, 2 contracts, premium 2.11 a share , strike of 124 expiring 7/26. I may end up rolling this as I’m long at 118.91 and I love that low avg price. 

$GME CC, 3 contracts, premium .41 a share, strike at 29 expiring 7/26. I have an additional 24 contracts from last week expiring this week as well that I rolled for about 2k. 

$DJT CC, 1 contract, premium 1.60 a share, strike 36, expiring 7/26.

 I stupidly sold cash puts on this immediately after the assassination attempt. The fundamentals are terrible, I’m just in it for the pump and dump. Just after the assassination attempt there was a pop on the 24 hour market, another pop in premarket, and at market open. I expected the same with Biden dropping out and while there was a surge on the 24 hour market, it failed to maintain those levels premarket and at the opening bell. I’ll be selling these just as soon as I can. 

$AVGO cash puts is kinda hurting me. 1 contract from last week with a strike of 158.5. I don’t think it will come back down to that level by end of week and I’ve tied up 16k that I could use to just buy the stock. It has an avg price projected price in one year at 192 on Fintel, with the price at 160 right now it's basically got a bigger upside potential than $NVDA. $NVDA is sitting at 123 with a projected 1 year avg of 132. Thinking between a 5:1 or 3:2 investment ratio $AVGO to $NVDA.

Finally $PFE.  I bought 30 calls, .55 a share premium, at a strike of 31 expiring 8/30. $PFE just spent 2.54 million on lobbying (info from quiverquant.com). They have earnings coming up on 7/30 premarket and there’s been breakthrough in glp-1 medication in pill form. Covid vaccinations will be on-going revenue and they’ve had positive earning several quarters in a row. My breakeven price is 31.55, so in retrospect I should have spent more money on a lower strike price, as there is significant resistance at 30. 

This is my first true options play.

When I google things, I usually get an article, but I don't know if its slanted one way or another.  

One reddit, while we can't fact check everything there are very KNOWLEDGEABLE people on here and if they post technical content usually others will chime in to verify or criticize it.

  
Plus it's more real time, when news hits people respond.  I have found SO MANY stock plays early from 'experts' chiming in on a news story....then usually the good ones panic and delete their message because they realized they spilled too much info.

  
Intel appears to be that one, we've had some ASML peeps chime in saying they are going all in Intel after working with them on their new order.  That is a powerful message and they described with complete accuracy how Intel will start to carve its way in to the race.  Now a lot of those messages got deleted, so you needed to scan quickly to see it. 

  
Just one example, in the medical field we have doctors commenting on new techniques or tech they are using.  If the company is public you can start to search it out.  

TMDX was one and same with PRCT (many users pumped PRCT first).

  
What else do we have besides reddit? It's a complete treasure trove for hedge funds. Some niche forums (like Ferrari, Rolls Royce etc) have good content as usually you can verify their wealth and what they are buying.  Oddly enough in those forums NVDA is being bought like hot cakes still.  So they don't have any good under the radar picks.  



Those asking where they next stock play is...GET OUT OF THIS FORUM. Search whatever industry you like and see what the users are talking about!

We saw the markets sell off yesterday due to the CPI news, think we’re going to have a relatively flat day today. Trying to post earlier, if this post gets more traction I'll try to post earlier, otherwise will revert to the regularly scheduled post times.



[TSLA](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d) - We saw TSLA delay their Robotaxi Event from August to October, watching for some form of bounce in the stock. Currently long, but will remain agile (as usual) if we selloff at the open.



[NVDA](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d) - We also saw this turn more strongly than the other Mag7 stocks because of the close to 15% move we saw it make in the past week. No opinion on this yet, but watching for a setup.



[T](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=T&p=d) - Announces massive hack of customer data, includes records of customer calls/texts.



[SNOW](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SNOW&p=d) - AT&T ($T) had their customer data illegaly downloaded from a workspace on a third-party cloud platform (identified as SNOW’s). Might be user error/social engineering (not sure) rather than a cybersecurity issue, so we might see a reversal of this move at the open. However, it should noted that there were no multifactor authentication safeguards in place in previous hacks of SNOW.



[JPM](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=JPM&p=d) - Reports $4.40 vs $4.19 expected EPS. NI at $18B was up 25% from the same period a year ago due to exchange of shares in Visa that provided $8B in gains.

Anyway, the upcoming split is what confuses me about this. She bought 20 options calls with a strike price of $800. Does that she mean that she thinks the current price of AVGO, currently $1744 a share, will drop significantly from its current price? Or does she think it will rise significantly from the 10 to 1 split price? Again, the split is what confuses me.",0,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1e0o4p6/can_someone_explain_to_me_nancy_pelosis_avgo/

On June 24, she sold off 2,500 shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) while buying 20 Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) call options with a strike price of $800 and an expiration date of June 20, 2025. Two days later, she purchased 10,000 shares of NVDA. Finally, she disclosed the sale of 2,000 shares of Visa (NYSE:V) on July 1.

$800 strike post split is insane.  What needs to happen for these calls to print?  And did anyone else make moves off this announcement?",0,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1e0ekzb/what_needs_to_happen_for_pelosis_calls_to_print/
2024-07-08 22:14:54,NVIDIA,NVDA,"MSFT and AAPL are overvalued and overbought, Wallstreet is expecting too much from AI. ","I got to try Microsoft's copilot this week and i have to say i was underwhelmed by what it had to offer. It just felt like an enhancement for windows with more features, nothing ground breaking. This wasn't a major leap in technology like going from fax's to email. Tech companies releasing new (free)upgrades and new (free)products is like Nike releasing a new pair of shoes, just something else to add to the lineup. Will it make SOME peoples jobs more efficient, yes. Is it applicable for most people, i have to say no. Nike makes shoes for athletes but maybe 1-2% actually use them for what its intended for. Lets say a company has 20,000 employees, of those employees how many need it for their role or will using it on a daily basis? Maybe 90 % wont. If that's accurate a company will only pay for the 10% that need a user license.

If chat GPT was never released all the mag 7 earnings would still be about the same without it.

Now for the overvalued and overbought. MSFT has a PE of 40, one of the highest of all the mag 7. Your paying $40 for every dollar they earn. Based on their current AI stack im not sure they will be able to beat the current expectations in a big way consistently. MSFT is not NVDA. NVDA chips cost $30k+ each, as much as a low end Tesla. Copilot has a free version and the pro version is $20-$30 per user. Most people at companies are not using this and im not sure this will add to the bottom line very much. That means most of the earnings growth will have to come from the cloud business, admittedly the cloud business has been growing at double digits for a long time but there is also a lot of competition in cloud space, at some point growth will slow as cap ex spending slows. The other thing to consider is what AI costs for these companies. The GPU's are expensive, Data storage is expensive and the energy demand from AI use is very very expensive. At some point AI use, especially from free users is going to eat into the profit margins.

MSFT right now is like buying a over priced Cadillac, yeah it drives nice but its overpriced.

AAPL is also overvalued at 35x earnings. Adding chatGPT to a smartphone and enhancing siri isn't worth the current valuation. The goggles were a bust. No new products on the horizon just same stuff just newer versions. Apple isn't the glamorous high growth tech company it once was. Iphones sales are falling off in China and this will definitely show in the next couple quarters of earnings. Its the Nike of tech stocks. People aren't spending $100 for shoes they certainly wont spend $900+ for a phone. I wouldn't be surprised if Buffet starts to offload shares at this PE ratio.

That fourth industrial revolution is not happening today or tomorrow, we are too early. This is going to take some time.

I agree with Ken Griffin on this, the current AI products on the market are not the revolution many are hoping for, they're mediocre at best. There's too much spending and too much free products for this to add to any company's bottom line. The real winners are semi's, data storage and anything surrounding it.

Mostly earnings aftermaths today. Also, hyperlinks to Finviz added, hopefully I'll be able to implement this going forward in the future! :)

[**MU**](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=MU)**-** Beat earnings estimates, due to strong demand for memory chips, but current quarter forecast wasn’t as positive as investors wanted. Company forecasted next quarter revenue in line with investor expectations. Reported $6.81B vs $6.67B revenue expected. Remember that MU makes the chips that NVDA that are used in the AI processors designed by NVDA. (I will do a writeup explaining semis in the future.)

[**WBA**](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=WBA)**-** Fell due to the company missing expectations, slashing profit outlooks, and cited a challenging environment for pharmacies and US consumers. Expects EPS 2.80 vs 2.95 a share for 2024. Reported EPS of .63 vs .68 expected, and revenue of 36.4B vs 35.94 expected. Worth watching if we have any sharp selloffs. CVS down in sympathy.

[**LEVI**](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=LEVI)**-** Reported revenue of 1.44B vs 1.45 expected, and EPS of $0.16 vs $0.04. Beat expectations, but CFO warned that consumers have been “generally cautious” about spending.

[**AMZN**](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=AMZN)**-** Hitting all time highs, watching 195/200 levels. No “new news” beyond that, so mainly will be patient for this one.

[**RIVN**](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=RIVN)**-** No new news beyond the Volkswagen investment, but still watching this.
