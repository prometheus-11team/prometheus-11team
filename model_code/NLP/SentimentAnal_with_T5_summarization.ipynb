Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were down 57 points, or 0.2%. ***** > Investors are coming off a positive session for the major averages. On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 209.52 points, or 0.62%, while the S&P 500 advanced 0.24%. The Nasdaq Composite lagged, rising just 0.18%. ***** > The June consumer price index report set for release Wednesday, as well as the June producer price index due out Thursday, will shed light on whether the decline in inflation has continued, and create the backdrop for future direction of interest rates. ***** > Investors have penciled in another quarter-point increase at the Federal Reserve\\u2019s July 25-26 meeting. But they are undecided about what the central bank will do at its September meeting after last week\\u2019s continued robust jobs data raised concern that policymakers will revert to raising rates following the June pause. ***** > \\u201cThe pause, agree or disagree, is to gather more information,\\u201d Solus Alternative Asset Management\\u2019s Dan Greenhaus said Monday on CNBC\\u2019s \\u201cClosing Bell.\\u201d He added, \\u201cOne more hike or two more hikes is much less important than when, ultimately, they begin to cut rates on the other side of this. That\\u2019s much more consequential for, I think, the risk landscape than one more hike or two more hikes.\\u201d ***** > On the economic front, June\\u2019s NFIB Small Business Index, a measure of business confidence, is set for release Tuesday before the bell. Economists polled by Dow Jones are anticipating a reading of 90.0, slightly higher than the 89.4 level in May. ***** > Second-quarter earnings season kicks off later this week with results from \\u201csystemically important financial institutions\\u201d such as JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup, plus BlackRock, PepsiCo and Delta Air.

On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 209.52 points, or 0.62%, while the S&P 500 advanced 0.24%. The Nasdaq Composite lagged, rising just 0.18%. ***** > The June consumer price index report set for release Wednesday, as well as the June producer price index due out Thursday, will shed light on whether the decline in inflation has continued, and create the backdrop for future direction of interest rates. ***** > Investors have penciled in another quarter-point increase at the Federal Reserve\\u2019s July 25-26 meeting. But they are undecided about what the central bank will do at its September meeting after last week\\u2019s continued robust jobs data raised concern that policymakers will revert to raising rates following the June pause. ***** > \\u201cThe pause, agree or disagree, is to gather more information,\\u201d Solus Alternative Asset Management\\u2019s Dan Greenhaus said Monday on CNBC\\u2019s \\u201cClosing Bell.\\u201d He added, \\u201cOne more hike or two more hikes is much less important than when, ultimately, they begin to cut rates on the other side of this. That\\u2019s much more consequential for, I think, the risk landscape than one more hike or two more hikes.\\u201d ***** > On the economic front, June\\u2019s NFIB Small Business Index, a measure of business confidence, is set for release Tuesday before the bell. Economists polled by Dow Jones are anticipating a reading of 90.0, slightly higher than the 89.4 level in May. ***** > Second-quarter earnings season kicks off later this week with results from \\u201csystemically important financial institutions\\u201d such as JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup, plus BlackRock, PepsiCo and Delta Air.

Other than that, same as NVDA, leaning bearish on it today but will be agile. **DJT-** Supposedly the presidential campaign is not involved with DJT, the latest themed memecoin according to close source. Martin Shkreli says he worked with Barron to create the token.

Findings from a systematic review and meta-analysis of urosepsis after ureteroscopy (URS) for stone management show that this serious complication occurs at an unexpectedly high rate and is associated with some surprising risk factors, according to investigators. The research, which is the first systematic review with meta-analysis to specifically investigate risk factors for and incidence of urosepsis after URS, analyzed data from 13 studies that included 5597 patients.1 It found a 5% pooled incidence of postoperative urosepsis and determined that preoperative stent placement, positive preoperative urine culture, older age, diabetes, longer procedure time, and ischemic heart disease were each associated with a statistically significant increased risk. \\u201cUreteroscopy has become the leading approach for treating stone disease because of its efficacy and the perception that it is a very safe procedure and associated with minimal morbidity. Therefore, the 5% rate of urosepsis was surprising to us and to other urologists as well, judging from posted tweets,\\u201d lead author Naeem Bhojani, MD, told Urology Times\\u00ae. Bhojani and senior author Ben H. Chew, MD, MSc, pointed out that although their study identified associations between certain variables and urosepsis risk, it does not establish causal relationships. For that reason and in the absence of evidence about the efficacy of preventive strategies targeting these factors, it is not possible to make any recommendations for risk management. \\u201cNevertheless, we believe our findings can be useful for urologists in preoperative risk stratification and for guiding the intensity of postoperative surveillance,\\u201d said Chew, an associate professor in the Department of Urologic Sciences at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. The 13 studies used for the meta-analysis included 5 prospective trials. Across the 13 studies, the rate of urosepsis ranged from 0.2% to 17.8%. The use of different criteria for urosepsis diagnosis and different durations of postoperative symptom surveillance (1 to 30 days) may, in part, account for the wide variability in rate, said Bhojani, a principal scientist, urologist, and associate professor at the University of Montreal in Canada. Although surprisingly high, the 5% rate of urosepsis appears to be true. In a follow-up investigation, the investigators turned to the IBM MarketScan Commercial Database that contained information from over 110,000 URS procedures performed in the United States. In that large cohort of cases with prospectively collected data, they found a nearly identical 30-day postoperative sepsis rate of 4.91%. Pre-op stent placement, older age were among risk factors In the meta-analysis, preoperative stent placement, positive preoperative urine culture, and older age were the strongest risk factors for postoperative urosepsis. The effects of having a stent or a positive urine culture are easy to understand because patients with these findings are likely colonized with bacteria or have bacteriuria, Bhojani said. The association with ischemic heart disease, however, was particularly surprising and hard to rationalize. Explanations for the associations between urosepsis and older age, diabetes, and longer procedure time are also unclear, although Bhojani postulated that increasing procedure time could favor translocation of bacteria into the bloodstream because it would be accompanied by an increasing level of intrarenal pressure. \\u201cThere are some observational data suggesting that exposure to a longer duration of increased intrarenal pressure can lead to infection being transmitted into the bloodstream, and we are currently studying that relationship further,\\u201d Bhojani said. Chew noted that large prospective studies would be needed to determine effective ways for reducing urosepsis risk. \\u201cBased on our study, we cannot say that patients with the risk factors we identified should be given more powerful antibiotics as prophylaxis or kept in the hospital longer so that they can be watched more closely for postoperative sepsis,\\u201d he said. \\u201cHowever, we think that urologists should remain aware that patients with 1 or more of the risk factors warrant more intensive monitoring because they may be at significant risk for urosepsis after URS.\\u201d Reference 1.

Upgrade Now Elections 2020: Stocks rise, tech shares rally as investors follow 2020 election results Emily McCormick \\u00b7 Reporter Updated November 4, 2020 15 min read In This Article: ^TNX ^GSPC ^DJI YM=F Stocks rose Wednesday as investors took in the flow of results for the 2020 election, which has so far produced no clear signs of a victor for the White House. [Click here to read what\\u2019s moving markets heading into Thursday, Nov. 5] As of market close, the S&P 500 was higher by 2.2%, and the Nasdaq outperformed with a gain of about 3.9%. The Dow shook off earlier declines from the overnight session to rise more than 1.3%, to add about 370 points. The results so far point to a presidential race that remains too close to call, with a number of consequential battleground states, including Pennsylvania, still unlikely to produce results for the next couple of days. As of Wednesday afternoon, former Vice President Joe Biden had 248 electoral votes and President Donald Trump had 214, according to the Associated Press. Six states had not yet been called. Candidates require 270 electoral votes to be named the winner of the election. States called for Trump: Ky., W. Va., S.C., Ala., Miss., Tenn., Okla., Ark., Ind., N.D., S.D., Wyo., La., Neb. (4 of 5 electoral votes), Kan., Mo., Idaho, Utah, Ohio, Iowa, Mont., Fla., Texas States called for Biden: Vt., Va., Conn., Del., Ill., Md., Mass., N.J., R.I., N.Y., N.M., D.C., Colo., N.H., Calif., Ore., Wash., Hawaii, Minn., Ariz., Maine (3 of 4 electoral votes), Wis. The flurry of incoming results stirred up volatility during the overnight session. Contracts on the major equity indices opened higher as overnight trading began, but gains in the Dow and S&P 500 futures flattened as the race tightened, including when the Associated Press projected Trump would win the swing state of Florida, which a number of pundits believed would go to Biden. Other states that had been viewed as toss-ups ended up tilting in Biden\\u2019s favor, including Arizona, which Trump had won in 2016. The Nasdaq, however, held decidedly higher overnight and into Wednesday. At about 10:15 p.m. ET Tuesday, Nasdaq futures surged nearly 4% to trigger a circuit breaker to cap further gains. The index held higher by more than 2.5% as of market open, with traders piling into tech shares that throughout much of the pandemic had served as a safe haven sector amid uncertainty over the economic outlook. In the bond market, U.S. Treasury yields tumbled across the long end of the curve to unwind much of their advance from their past couple weeks. The 10-year Treasury yield dipped below 80 basis points Wednesday morning after earlier jumping above 90 basis points, as investors pulled back their expectations for a Democratic sweep that would likely have brought about bigger government spending. With some Senate races still needing to be settled, Democrats were tracking Wednesday morning to net a gain of just one seat in the Senate, whereas at least three were needed to take majority control of the chamber.

Those units, which vest annually starting in 2023, are intended to keep Cook with Apple until at least 2025. Cook could earn an additional 333,987 shares in Apple stock \\u2014 which could vest at 200% of their value \\u2014 depending on Apple's performance across that period. In total, based on current Apple stock value, Cook has over $110 million in Apple stock. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. Apple CEO and billionaire Tim Cook was just granted tens of millions of dollars worth of Apple stock as an incentive to stay on with the company through 2025. According to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing published this week, Cook received 333,987 restricted stock units in Apple \\u2014 shares in the company that will vest across three years, starting in 2023. At the current market value, the shares would be worth nearly $40 million. Apple's board of directors characterized the stock grant as a \\\"recognition of his outstanding leadership\\\" in a statement, but the role of granting restricted stock units to employees is retention \\u2014 if Cook were to leave Apple before those shares vest, he wouldn't receive them. \\u2014Stephen Nellis (@StephenNellis) September 29, 2020 In addition to the retention-based stock grant, Apple's board of directors also issued a performance-based grant: Should he meet certain goals tied to his performance as CEO, Cook would receive another 333,987 stock units \\u2014 and they could vest at up to 200% of their value. In total, should Cook stay with Apple through the end of 2025 and meet his performance targets, he could receive approximately $115 million in stock based on current market value. And given Apple's stock history, it's likely that the value when these units vest will actually be much higher than it currently is. Cook became a billionaire earlier this year, primarily based on his salary at Apple, stock he owns in the company, and earnings from shares he's sold. Got a tip?
